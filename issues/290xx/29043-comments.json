If we had infrastructure that was fuzzing with gcc (e.g. compiling with afl++'s `afl-g++-fast`) then this would clearly make sense. I think if we are going to care about this, we should also add a gcc fuzz CI job and have a linter (maybe a custom clang-tidy plugin?) that checks for dependence on evaluation order (which would probably be a good idea in any case).",
