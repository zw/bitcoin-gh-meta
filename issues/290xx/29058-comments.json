I'm thinking of destination nodes behind firewalls with deep packet inspection which block ips from further connections if they don't follow the protocol (i.e. for bitcoin v1 connections, initiating with a version message). If that's the case, the user would only have the option to disable v2transport in general, or use the `addnode` RPC instead. Not sure how realistic that \"i want to connect via v1 explicitly, as connecting via v2 first causes trouble\"-scenario is at all though.\r\n\r\nI don't know either if this scenario is realistic, and, as you point out, there is the always the workaround of using the addnode rpc. I guess in general it's less nice to add options to `-cli` args compared to rpcs: The alternative is that we could allow some construction like `-connect=1.2.3.4:8333|v1transport` (and similar to `-addnode` / `-seednode`) but then we need additional string parsing / documentation for that, and I think we should only do it if there is an actual use case for it.",

From [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki): \r\n\r\n>Encryption, even when it is unauthenticated and only used when both endpoints support v2, impedes eavesdropping by forcing the attacker to become active: either by performing a persistent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, by downgrading connections to v1, or by spinning up their own nodes and getting honest nodes to make connections to them. Active attacks at scale are more resource intensive in general, but in the case of manual, deliberate connections (as opposed to automatic, random ones), they are also in principle detectable: even very basic checks, e.g., operators manually comparing protocol versions and session IDs (as supported by the proposed protocol), will expose the attacker.\r\n\r\nSo along that thinking, the situation you describe should trigger the user to be angry at their firewall (unless that becomes a widely used practice due to some wide regulation, which is only a theoretical, and i think unlikely, outcome in the future). Otherwise, if we encourage bending under such firewalls, the v2 battle is kinda lost anyway...\r\n@sipa could correct me",

I was merely wondering whether connecting via v1 directly could still be demanded for some users during the next few releases until v2 is more widespread. In these rare cases (if they exist at all), they could of course always either turn off `v2transport` completely (probably unpleasant if you only need the direct-v1-connect for a single peer) or use the `addnode` RPC with the `v2transport` parameter set to false, so it shouldn't be a problem at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess one could argue that it's a bit inconsistent/confusing to allow explicit v1 connections for the `addnode` RPC, but not for the `-addnode` bitcoind parameter. I think they should at least behave identical if no explicit transport version is specified for the node to add, i.e. `addnode` should IMHO by default try to connect via v2 if `-v2transport` is set to bitcoind, but the `v2transport` boolean parameter wasn't set explicitly. But this is unrelated to this PR, and probably fits better to a future \"use v2transport by default\" PR anyways.\r\n",

If this causes problems for them (e.g. because somehow addnode with default v2 causes issues), they always have the ability to just not do that.\r\n* Eventually, having V2 default for addnode/connect makes sense. There is a significant UX advantage to not needing to specify, and BIP324 qualities are most apparent when it's widely deployed. The downside is essentially doubling the number of connections made for v1 peers and peers that drop connections for unrelated reasons, but I expect *manual* connection attempts to be relatively rare, and only a fraction of all connection attempts in any case.\r\n\r\nBefore enabling `-v2transport` by default (which I'd image may happen after #24748) we could consider a way to force manual connections to be only-v1 or even only-v2 (disabling reconnect-with-v1). A possibility could be through a net permission flag, if #27114 makes it in.",

Right now I'm not 100% sure the benefits are worthy of code complexity :) Better p2p logging (on the disconnected end) may be even better goal than saving up one useless v1/v2 reconnection.\r\nCurious what you think about this idea.",
