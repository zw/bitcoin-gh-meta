      "body" : "Seems like asserting for the debug log message \"Added connection peer=\" is insufficient for ensuring that this new connection will show up in a following `getpeerinfo()` call, as the debug message is written in the `CNode` ctor, which means it hasn't been added to `CConnman.m_nodes` at this point yet. If I'm not missing anything, then using the newly introduced `wait_for_new_peer` helper instead of asserting the debug log should fix that.",
