      "body" : "I added a commit that has a few question marks about which contexts should have their own TxHashCache. I'm not entirely understanding which contexts have the `PrecomputedTxData` either. The `MutableTransactionSignatureCreator` is the most troubling, because since the `TransactionSignatureChecker` takes a ptr to `TxHashCache`, some cache needs to live outside of the `MutableTransactionSignatureCreator` while actually that cache could be empty on every call. So it seems like we actually might have to add cache variables to all that stuff. I didn't do it until now, though.\r\n\r\nLeft some todos with questions where I was unsure.",
