I remember it took 30 minutes to open a full node in 2020, and that's why I switched to pruned. \r\nBut four hours? \r\nHow do I avoid the initial \"verification\"? \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nOpen the program. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nDownload the blockchain up to 2018, turn if off. Turn it on again. \r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n0.23.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWindows 7\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nI'm using a EVO 870 SSD, and my processor is a i5 8400, with 32gb of RAM.
