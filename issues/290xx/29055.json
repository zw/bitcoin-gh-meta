Doing so invalidates pointers which causes issues with some PRs and branches that I am working on. This was being used incorrectly in a few tests and benchmarks, resulting in segfaults.\r\n\r\nAs a precaution for this kind of issue in the future, I've also added a few asserts to `LoadWallet()` so that developers will notice when it is used incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAs similar issue was fixed in #27666",
