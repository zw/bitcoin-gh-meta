   "body" : "This PR improves the following fragile construct for detection of a new connection to the node under test in `p2p_v2_transport.py`:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d5790956f45e3de5c6c4ee6fda21878b0d1287b/test/functional/p2p_v2_transport.py#L154-L156\r\nOnly relying on the number of peers for that suffers from race conditions, as unrelated previous peers could disconnect at anytime in-between. In the test run in #29002, the following happens:\r\n\r\n- `getpeerinfo()` is called the first time -> assigned to `num_peers`\r\n- **previous peer disconnects**, the node's peer count is now `num_peers - 1` (in most test runs, this happens before the first getpeerinfo call)\r\n- new peer connects, the node's peer count is now `num_peers`\r\n- the condition that the node's peer count is `num_peers + 1` is never true, test fails\r\n\r\nUse the more robust approach of watching for an increased highest peer id instead (again using the `getpeerinfo` RPC call), with a newly introduced context manager method `TestNode.wait_for_new_peer()`. Note that for the opposite case of a disconnect, no new method is introduced; this is currently used only once in the test and is also simpler.\r\n\r\nStill happy to take suggestions for alternative solutions.\r\n\r\nFixes #29002.",
