Ideally it would not slow down.\r\n\r\nSince these descriptors don't involve any miniscript-specific operations, perhaps it's possible to return earlier in whatever parsing / signing algorithm is involved here. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun the large multisig test in the above mentioned PR before and after the commit.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@4f473ea515bc77b9138323dab8a741c063d32e8f\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nmacOS and CI\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
