That would presumably mean util/bitdeque.h and util/sock.cpp should also eventually go elsewhere, for example? That seems like a bad approach to me (in that it means code has to move into and out of util based on whether it's relevant to the kernel, rather than due to any changes to the code itself, and users then potentially have to deal with it moving into/outof the util:: namespace).",

As for now, it reads:\r\n\r\nThis seems like the right place to talk about the relationship between the util and kernel library. My work on the kernel library has been focusing on reducing its essence to validation code, pruning external dependencies, and stripping out as much system related functionality as possible. I think if the goal is to have the kernel be capable of running on as many platforms as possible, potentially beyond the number of platforms that Bitcoin Core is capable of today and extending into embedded environments, this last point becomes crucial.\r\n\r\nLooking at the content of `util` it provides roughly two types of functionality: Utilities for basic data structures and their serialization, and cross-platform system related utilities, like file handling, threading, process handling, etc. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, making the `util` library a proper dependency of the kernel should not introduce new cross-platform system-related content into the kernel library. Besides potentially limiting use cases of the kernel, providing cross-platform utilities beyond what the kernel strictly requires seems like a potentially unreasonable future maintenance burden. This would be contrary to our incremental process of creating a minimal kernel library.\r\n\r\nThe asterisk here is that some of the utilities that are not currently used by the kernel do not introduce new dependencies, since they entirely rely on code that is already used by the kernel. I also generally think that some utilities could remain in the util library even though they are not currently used by validation code. The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\n1. The module is directly used by kernel code.\r\n2. The module contains basic data structure utilities for interacting with kernel code.\r\n3. The module does not contain system-related utilities that are not directly used by the kernel.\r\n4. The module does not contain project-specific code that is not relevant to the kernel.\r\n5. The module does not introduce new dependencies beyond the current dependencies of the kernel.\r\n\r\nLooking at @hebasto's comment [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28690#pullrequestreview-1774033780), `threadinterrupt.cpp` and `readwritefile.cpp` would violate the 3rd criteria in my eyes, while the `spanparsing` and `bytevectorhash` modules could potentially remain in `util`.\r\n\r\nBetween this PR and #28690 I think it would be nice if common criteria for `util` would be defined and documented. All this said, I think it would be acceptable too if things were kept purposefully vague as they are now until the need for more concrete structures arises.",

I could see this being useful in the future if util library started growing a lot and accumulating more features of over time.\r\n\r\nBut for now, IMO, just sticking with the current util/common separation and using the cleanup in this PR would organize things better and be less confusing than having two util versions, and it would require moving fewer things. Even though the libraries.md document is currently ambiguous, I think it should be pretty easy to remove the ambiguity here.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29015#issuecomment-1849026409\r\n\r\n> The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\nI think these are good rules if you replace \"basic data structure utilities\" with \"basic utilities that to do not require outside dependencies\", and also drop the 3rd rule.

I just don't you need to `rm src/util/sock.cpp` to achieve these goals. As long as the util library is distributed as a static library, or built as a static library and linked into a dynamic library, the socket functions will not be part of resulting executables if they are not called. And if the kernel is being built for a platform which doesn't support sockets at all, `src/util/sock.cpp` can just be stubbed or not compiled at all and there should be no problem for portability either. I do think it's good to keep the util library small and lightweight and remove things which don't fit there. But I don't think it needs to be stripped down in a more extreme way.",

I guess kernel code isn't currently using this function (or #28960 removes the last usage), but as long as kernel code is calling threads, what benefit is to preventing kernel code from calling this function? It seems like a useful function, and if anything more code should use it, I would think.\r\n\r\nI do agree with goals of making the kernel small and portable, and agree we should organize libraries with that in mind. I also think we should try to trigger link errors to enforce API boundaries. It just seems to me we can do these things without moving a lot around.",
