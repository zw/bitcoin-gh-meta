Regular testnet difficulty is too high for my humble S9 (let alone a CPU miner) to win blocks.\r\n\r\nUsing real mining equipment as opposed to a CPU miner is useful, because of the many quirks real devices have (e.g. version bit grinding). Afaik there's no good emulator.\r\n\r\nAlthough I won't actually need this mining script to test local pool software, I patched it anyway to serve as a reference to compare the pool software against.\r\n\r\ncc @ajtowns, @kallewoof",
