   "body" : "Implementation of OP_TXHASH and OP_CHECKTXHASHVERIFY, as per the [draft BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1500).\r\n\r\nThis MR includes a test using the test vectors generated from the reference implementation in the BIP.\r\nThe implementation utilizes a caching strategy that hopefully alleviates concerns around resource usage like quadratic hashing.\r\n\r\nThis MR on purpose does not make any consensus changes yet. Activation of the proposed opcodes will be coordinated in an independent MR, probably combined with other opcodes (like OP_CAT and/or OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK).\r\n\r\n(I'm not very familiar with checks and lints on here, so I'll try to address problems as they come. I have personally been able to compile and run the tests, but that usually is only the tip of the iceberg.)",
