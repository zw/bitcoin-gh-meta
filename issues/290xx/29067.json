   "body" : "`struct` has many issues in messages.py:\r\n\r\n* For unpacking, it requires to specify the length a second time, even when it is already clear from the `f.read(num_bytes)` context.\r\n* For unpacking, it is designed to support a long format string and returning a tuple of many values. However, except for 3 instances in `messages.py`, usually only a single value is unpacked and all those cases require an `[0]` access.\r\n* For packing and unpacking of a single value, the format string consists of characters that may be confusing and may need to be looked up in the documentation, as opposed to using easy to understand self-documenting code.\r\n\r\nI presume the above issues lead to accidentally treat `msg_version.relay` as a \"signed bool\", which is fine, but confusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFix all issues by using the built-in `int` helpers `to_bytes` and `from_bytes` via a scripted diff.\r\n\r\nReview notes:\r\n\r\n* `struct.unpack` throws an error if the number of bytes passed is incorrect. `int.from_bytes` doesn't know about \"missing\" bytes and treats an empty byte array as `int(0)`. \"Extraneous\" bytes should never happen, because all `read` calls are limited in this file. If it is important to keep this error behavior, a helper `int_from_stream(stream, num_bytes, bytes, byteorder, *, **kwargs)` can be added, which checks the number of bytes read from the stream.\r\n* For `struct.pack` and `int.to_bytes` the error behavior is the same, although the error messages are not identical.\r\n\r\n",
