   "body" : "This change consists of three commits:\r\n\r\n* The first commit is a pure refactoring that removes the restriction that two wallets can only be opened at the same time if they are contained in the same directory.\r\n* The second commit removes the restriction that `-wallet` filenames can only refer to files in the `-walletdir` directory.\r\n* The third commit makes second commit a little safer by changing bitcoin to create wallet databases as directories rather than files, so they can be safely backed up.\r\n\r\nAll three commits should be straightforward:\r\n\r\n*  The first commit adds around 20 lines of new code and then updates a bunch of function signatures (generally updating them to take plain fs::path parameters, instead of combinations of strings, fs::paths, and objects like CDBEnv and CWalletDBWrapper).\r\n* The second commit removes two `-wallet` filename checks and adds some test cases to the multiwallet unit test.\r\n* The third commit just changes the mapping from specified wallet paths to bdb environment & data paths.\r\n\r\n  ---\r\n\r\n**Note:** For anybody looking at this PR for the first time, I think you can skip the comments before _20 Nov_ and start reading at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#issuecomment-345625565. Comments before  _20 Nov_ were about an earlier version of the PR that didn't include the third commit, and then confusion from not seeing the first commit.",
