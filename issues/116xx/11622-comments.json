I like BIP70 in concept (automatic refund addresses, key expiration, allowing the wallet to directly authenticate vendors, direct transaction submission), but not the technical implementation, and also not the dependency burden it puts on bitcoin core.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it also seems the code is not maintained. No one is working on BIP70 support in bitcoin core.\r\n\r\nSo I'm ok with signalling that in the future we might be going to deprecate it, without any commitments - this would be the first step, to allow builders to disable it.\r\n\r\n(my personal motivation is that I want to have the option to build the GUI without protobuf and without OpenSSL after the last remnants of OpenSSL use are removed from the rest of the code)\r\n\r\n> For information, I plan to make BIP70 deprecated into NBitcoin. (By removing it from main lib, and moving it to separate package)\r\n\r\nSeems to be better design anyhow. Here it's been peppered all over the GUI code :( Also for lib-ifying, isolating the parts affected like this is the first step.\r\n\r\n> Should add to travis matrix?\r\n\r\nAgree that that's a good idea to warrant that this keeps working.\r\n\r\n",

What I am arguing is that by successfully downloading the payment request over a HTTPS channel, you also verified PKI through whatever arbitrary trust store you use underneath.

How do you know that the public key which sign is coming from the merchant/coinbase? how can you be sure about the identity behind the key without relying on a PKI stack (SSL/TLS) or a web of trust?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "> Yes I agree, PKI as used in BIP70 is useless. What I am arguing is that by successfully downloading the payment request over a HTTPS channel, you also verified PKI through whatever arbitrary trust store you use underneath. (OpenSSL, Windows trust store, or iOS trust store)\r\n\r\nSo what? You haven't gained anything in doing so aside from validating that your attacker is capable of getting an SSL cert issued, which is a free and automated process these days. Not sure what your point is here.\r\n\r\n> This is better, but you still have the problem of identity misbinding. How do you know that the public key which sign is coming from the merchant/coinbase? how can you be sure about the identity behind the key without relying on a PKI stack (SSL/TLS) or a web of trust?\r\n\r\nMy point is you dont get that via BIP70 either, and I dont see that changing at any point in the future. Still, you *do* get this (somewhat) from bitcoin: URIs, as you may expect a user to only click such a link on the expected website's checkout flow (no different from where they enter their credit card). That is a very weak guarantee, but it is infinitely better than what BIP70 provides.",
