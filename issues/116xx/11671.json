   "body" : "It seems some bright spark has decided that getinfo command is not needed in new versions of the daemons, and removed it.\r\nNow you need one command to see the amount of blocks, another one to see the amount of connections, and one more to see the balance.\r\nBut now there are:\r\ngetblockchaininfo\r\ngetmempoolinfo\r\ngettxoutsetinfo\r\ngetmemoryinfo (\"mode\")\r\ngetmininginfo\r\ngetaddednodeinfo ( \"node\" )\r\ngetnetworkinfo\r\ngetpeerinfo\r\ngetwalletinfo\r\nwhich individually do not provide general information.\r\nThank you developers. Remove this command in your own wallets. But take getinfo back to me, leave the possibility to compile with this command.\r\n\r\nI do not understand the meaning of your innovation if it deprives the user of convenience.",
