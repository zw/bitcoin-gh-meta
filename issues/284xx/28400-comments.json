Namely: rather than only maintaining a single muhash for the utxo set you have, also maintain one for the outputs you've pruned as unspendable (or multiple indexes if you introduce more over time). Then you might have:\r\n\r\n * at block height 810,000\r\n * the spendable utxo set has muhash X\r\n * the OP_RETURN utxos have muhash Y\r\n * the bad pubkey utxos have muhash Z\r\n\r\nif you compare with a node running current master, you then verify that your `X+Z` matches their `X`.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to initialize these values on upgrade: Z=0, then iterate through your utxo set looking for bad pubkeys, adding them to Z as you find them, and removing them from the utxo set. Downgrading breaks things though.\r\n\r\nI don't think you can bootstrap utreexo from just the utxo set at an arbitrary height in the first place, so I don't think its really affected by this. For assumeutxo, if you want to be able to distribute the utxo set snapshots over p2p, then peers that have pruned unspendable utxos won't have them to share with peers that don't realise they're unspendable in the first place, but if you're just producing signed snapshots, then you could probably just publish two versions until the old software goes out of its support window.",

I agree this should work, but obviously at the cost of increased complexity (as there is much more to change than only the logic of a single method), and there should be a really good reason for doing it.\r\n\r\n> It's easy to initialize these values on upgrade: Z=0, then iterate through your utxo set looking for bad pubkeys, adding them to Z as you find them, and removing them from the utxo set. Downgrading breaks things though.\r\n\r\nRight, and you'd also need to somehow detect if an upgrade has already happened. In #2791 it was proposed to either scan for a particular output in the UTXO set (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2791#issuecomment-21256241) or to introduce a flag in the chainstate database (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2791#issuecomment-21292138).\r\n\r\n@russeree: Can you give some additional motivation? While I enjoy very much reasoning about these kind of topics, it's still unclear to me what concrete problem this PR is trying to solve. The description claims that about 20k of outputs could be pruned. As of now (block 806205), that's merely 0.016% of the total UTXO set size, freeing up about 1,24 MB of chainstate space (if we assume an average size of 65 bytes per UTXO). I'd argue that these numbers are way too low (even if you 10x them for the sake of projecting into the future) to justify the increased complexity in different areas that would need to be touched (i.e. differentiating between different `IsUnspendable` reasons and update all call-sites correctly, maintaining an extra MuHash, implementing an UTXO set upgrade mechanism, probably adapting `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC results to include both \"new-pruned-MuHash\" and \"old-unpruned-MuHash\", dealing with different `dumptxoutset`/`loadtxoutset` result/behaviour on old vs new nodes for AssumeUTXO etc. etc.).\r\n\r\nAlso, calling `IsFullyValid` is significantly more expensive than just doing the usual Solver matching and length checks, so one would also need to analyze if this has a noticable negative performance impact on standardness checks.\r\n",

You should read more carefully before asserting a slippery slope economic argument about STAMPS. \r\n\r\n> to remove provably unspendable P2PK and P2MS tx outpoints from the UTXO set.\r\n\r\nThese outputs are already unspendable mathematically, and the person spending to them agreed to that condition upon signing. \r\n\r\n> > This trims nearly 20K outpoints from the UTXO set at height 805618.\r\n> \r\n> Concept NACK.\r\n> \r\n> At the moment the UTXO set has 130 million entries. Reducing it by 0.015% isn't worth the technical risk.\r\n> \r\n> By comparison, there have been 53 million OP_Return outputs. Removing those from the UTXO set was a not-so-trivial ~30% reduction.\r\n\r\nOP_RETURN outputs are not provably unspendable though, they have valid spending paths. So the comparison is irrelevant, the point is why would you incentivize the storage of something that is basically a burned output? Sure right now the storage space is negligible, however you would have to have a completely non-adversarial mindset to suggest that no one would ever exploit this further.\r\n",

How would this affect other potential legitimate use cases?\r\n\r\nMost STAMPS txs are spendable and are not affected by this PR. As I understand it, that protocol sets up a 1-of-3 multisig, where of the keys is valid (providing a spendable path) and the other two are used for data, and are thus provably unspendable about 50% of the time as the data doesn't match a valid secp point. The only times those txs become unspendable are when the one valid key is replaced by an invalid key -- eg the txs linked in my previous comment have a pubkey `030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303` which is neither a valid point nor carries any data.",

I thought compressed pubkeys covered almost everything on the X axis because the y is derived? Also many of the pruned outpoints are not compressed pubkeys but instead uncompressed.\r\n\r\nThe formula is `y^2 = x^3 + 7`, so you derive `x^3+7` for any `x`, but only half of those will be valid squares -- every number `0 < i < p/2` squares to the same result as the different number `p-i` does, so you only use up half the possible numbers as squares; presuming `x^3+7` is just randomly choosing a number between 1 and p, then half the time it won't be a square. You get back to having `~2^256` points despite half of the `~2^256` x coords being invalid because each of the valid coords gives you two points (`y` and `p-y`).",
