I'm working on implementing the labels part of silent payments so it would not always be the same address, just optionally if the user has chose to apply a label\r\n\r\nIn an older draft, we did implement a new RPC `getsilentpaymentaddress`, which could also take a label argument. Testers and reviewers seemed to like that approach better. Personally, I prefer using `getnewaddress` and I think passing the output type of \"silent-payment\" makes it clear enough that this is a static payment code. The reason I like this approach better is it avoids introducing a new RPC that will only be used by a handful of users. Seems annoying to have an RPC that just doesn't work 90% of the time. But I'd be happy with either approach.",
