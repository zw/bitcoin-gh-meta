   "body" : "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",
