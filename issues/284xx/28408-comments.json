If the configuration includes `datacarrier=0` this variable is `nullopt`. It's surprising to me that without this suggestion (comparing an `int32_t` to an unset `std::optional<unsigned int>` for greater-than), the test succeeds (which deems the transaction to be invalid, so the mempool stays completely empty).\r\n\r\nThis suggestion also requires changing the return type of `DatacarrierBytes()` from `int32_t` to `uint32_t` (I think an unsigned type makes more sense anyway).\r\n\r\nNote that this change does not cause the mempool to accept data-carrying transactions (as it might appear) if `datacarrier=0` because they're filtered out by the call to `IsStandardTx()` earlier in this function.",

About 30% of hash power is mining full-rbf\ntransactions, and they charge no premium to mine those transactions.\n\nThere is zero reason to believe that mining pools would charge exorbitant fees\nto mine transactions that can be mined by simply not upgrading to the latest\nBitcoin Core, and/or setting `-datacarriersize=1000000`.\n",

I am describing the effect of this pull-req, not commenting on its intended purpose.\r\n\r\nHas the standardization of OP_RETURN created private mempools? Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nI think we must also go beyond miners, pruned nodes have seen their size increase by more than 60% in not even a year because inscriptions do not use OP_RETURN. This practice simply attacks the nodes of the network, while it could be done in a harmless way. ",

(Or rasan-titon-vybong, timill-bysanditonra\r\n  dollars, for those who prefer the tonal number system.)\r\n\r\n  Miners who use an updated version of Bitcoin Core with this PR would lose\r\n  that fee revenue, which is substantial, and unexpectedly become\r\n  uncompetitive relative to other miners, either using an older version of\r\n  Bitcoin Core, or who change the default `-datacarriersize`.\r\n\r\n- Beyond the immediate loss of inscription reveal transaction fee revenue, this\r\n  would appear to be long-term incentive-incompatible for miners. The total\r\n  contribution of inscriptions to block rewards is much higher than the above\r\n  quoted figure, since it doesn't include commit transactions, subsequent\r\n  transfers, or ancillary transactions, so miners would probably prefer not to\r\n  discourage such activity.\r\n\r\n- This change would prevent the relay of inscription reveal transactions.\r\n  However, it does not prevent the relay and mining of inscription commit\r\n  transactions. Thus, if widely adopted, it would effectively lock inscription\r\n  commit transaction outputs, making it impossible to spend them using their\r\n  tapscript spend path.\r\n\r\n  Although sophisticated users could retrieve locked commit transaction outputs\r\n  either with a key path spend, or by submitting the full reveal transaction\r\n  directly to a miner who processes nonstandard transactions, unsophisticated\r\n  users, or those using software that doesn't support recovering commit\r\n  transaction outputs with a keypath spend, would find their funds locked.\r\n\r\n  I think this would represent a mild form of confiscation, and should be\r\n  avoided.\r\n",

And every time that happens there'll be a lot of pressure on maintainers to push it through quickly \"to stop the spam\". It's just a matter of time before some DoS vector accidentally makes it in.\r\n\r\nFor example you're currently looking for this pattern, used for inscriptions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOP_FALSE OP_IF spam OP_ENDIF\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pattern fits about 1000 data pushes with each a max of 520 bytes, so 520 KB, per output.\r\n\r\nIf this PR were widely deployed, the pattern could be changed as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOP_TRUE OP_IF spam OP_2DROP â¦ OP_2DROP\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the \"spammers\" now need to use up to 500 `OP_2DROP` codes so the stack is empty again, reducing the capacity to 515 KB. This time the code is actually executed by nodes, which is (slightly?) worse.\r\n\r\nNext move?",

Neither they are spam nor an attack. Casey figured out a smart way to use bitcoin for this use case.

However I can't rightly label the inscriptions as 'spam', nor would I dub their exclusion from the mempool 'censorship'. The distinction between 'censorship' and 'spam filtering' is entirely subjective. \r\n\r\nIf i publish a chain of 1000 transactions pointlessly bouncing coins around my own wallet addresses, is that spam? What about a single big (in terms of weight) transaction which only pays from myself to myself? The whole BTC network (including myself) would be better off if i didn't do that. I'm needlessly inflating the fee market for zero utility. In my humble opinion, inscriptions are similarly redundant because they could be done off-chain, so their on-chain utility to the network is near zero as well.\r\n\r\nIf people want to donate money to miners by uploading pointless 'spam' data to the blockchain, they will _always_ be able to find ways of doing that.

      "body" : "Concept NACK.\n\nSo, we come back to what was originally and consistently advised, based on the free-market principles that fundamentally underly Bitcoin's incentives: The \"solution\" to inscriptions txs is to price them out with non-inscriptions txs. This is a natural process that happens over time, and has at least 2 dimensions:\n\n1. Inscriptions txs (that are willing to pay a high enough fee to have higher priority confirmation) decrease over time, as demand falls, as their novelty wears off. Or, maybe the novelty never wears off, but that is also fine, see (2).\n\n2. Non-inscriptions txs (that are willing to pay a high enough fee to have higher priority confirmation) increase over time, as demand rises, as Bitcoin awareness and adoption and demand to use layer 1 rise.\n\nIn case it needs reminding, low-fee txs of any kind are not designed for layer 1, for decentralization-consistent reasons (accessibility of mining nodes and non-mining nodes decreases, as layer 1 capacity is increased to allow low-fee txs to have a high enough priority to escape the mempool and get mined).\n\nIf the issue is that not even layer 2s (like LN) currently scale well enough for the low-fee txs (seen by required layer 1 fee being too high, implying not enough blockspace supply and too much blockspace demand), the solution is not to try to forcefully decrease layer 1 demand/supply. This would be a high-time-preference behavior and a fool's errand, since the free market will still find a way to express that demand/supply, and also the \"solution\" employed may be worse for bitcoin than the original problem by creating new and worse problems.\n\nThe solution is instead multi-fold:\n\n1. Decrease layer 1 demand by communicating and collaborating with relevant parties to increase efficiency (getting same/better result with fewer resources through better software design) of layer 1 inscriptions txs + to increase efficiency of layer 1 LN txs (e.g. through advancing proposals like CTV).\n\n2. Increase layer 1 supply in a decentralization-consistent manner, such as extension blocks... and/or if the community has overcome its bcash PTSD yet, then through a well-thought-out block size increase (as used to be the plan before the proto-bcashers chose to forcefully demand big changes and poisoned the well). There is also BitVM on layer 1, which apparently can enable Drivechain, which can then enable greater capacity via 2wp sidechains -- all this without any forks, thanks to BitVM.\n\n3. Increase layer 2 options. Discuss enabling covenants or whatever is needed for Ark to work properly.",

Attempting to define chain behavior and transaction censorship of their own accord and against the wishes of many of those utilizing the chain.\r\n2. Are providing misleading information on a government platform and attempting to paint this as some sort of vulnerability when it is clearly not.\r\n\r\nAt worst, one could argue that this is a bug that has become a feature.\r\n\r\nAs software engineers know, many times software may have behavior that was not necessarily intended by the developer, but the end user leverages the behavior to build their own tooling and process around it. Future changes to the product must include the end users' utilization of the programs functionality in mind and should not change \"just because\" one feels it could be designed differently. This is the same thing that has happened here with inscriptions / ordinals.\r\n\r\nGiven the value that there is with provenance and on-chain data, I will note that many who originally were on Ethereum have now migrated to Bitcoin _because_ the data is truly on-chain vs other methods on Ethereum that utilized pointing to IPFS or other off-chain mechanisms to store data. Bitcoin has a chance to truly and uniquely position this functionality for future adoption in mainstream and should not simply kill it because it falls outside of the original payments design of the platform.\r\n\r\nIt is ok to debate around if this functionality is good or bad, but lets have an **honest** conversation instead of trying to dictate the terms of the debate to try to strong arm a conclusion.\r\n\r\nWe are all, after all, pro decentralization at the end of the day, are we not?\r\n\r\nSources, especially for those not native to the conversation above:\r\nDocs.ordinals explains underlying concept:\r\nhttps://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html\r\nBitgo briefly explains changes to segregated witness soft fork and taproot soft fork: https://blog.bitgo.com/the-rise-of-ordinal-inscriptions-dbe7cb0336c6\r\n\r\nEdit to remove unnecessary text/update phrasing to focus on the core issues at hand.",

The establishment power structure including MSM trumpet such things as an argument to try to ban bitcoin, or force miners to act to stop such transactions.\n\nIn both cases, the basic Bitcoin principles are important to remember: Bitcoin is a decentralized permissionless network + censorship-resistance of txs is a core characteristic. -- What this basically means is anyone can use their bitcoin in whichever manner they desire, regardless how distasteful (for any reason) the use case, and no single entity can do anything to prevent it. -- And there are incentives designed into the bitcoin system to also reduce the chance of succeeding (e.g. miners can leave a country, as miners did from China a couple years ago after China cracked down).\n\nIf we can agree on this, and not cite distasteful usage (gambling/scams/terrorists/CP/moneylaundering/etc.) as a motivation to target certain transactions, then we (plural, collectively) can move on to other aspects of this controversy that motivate people... such as \"layer 1 tx fees are getting too high because of inscriptions txs\" and other arguments.",

      "body" : "> going to a casino does not oblige the entire planet to have an indelible mark of fact that you went to a casino. Inscriptions do.\n\nThe thing is that inscriptions were not simply possible and begun to be used only when Casey released his software. The concept of inserting arbitrary data was already possible, and thus done, throughout bitcoin's history (this means your node already had arbitrary data, including various distasteful data). You can do a simple google search and see research papers written analyzing bitcoin's arbitrary data, before Casey's software.\n\nWhat this means is whatever you think you're supporting to solve this issue is not in fact solving it. Or if it solves it in one way, they will use another way to do it anyway. And that other way may increase the UTXO set, while otherwise it would not. Others have already pointed out this criticism many times in this thread (as did I in my first thread response in the last couple days). \n\nFighting this is a losing battle, if doing so via code, since bitcoin is designed as a neutral (non-biased) network. \n\nA better idea is to take this effort to the social layer (religion/culture/etc.) to educate people that \"gambling is bad for your health\" or political layer (jail gamblers? lol), and so try to get people to stop doing it.\n\n\n> > People also use their bitcoin for other distasteful things\n> \n>\n> \n> Yes and it doesn't bother me because they are financial txs.\n\nSo your issue is not actually that inscriptions txs enable gambling (falls in the category of distasteful activity), but that these inscriptions txs are not financial txs?\n\n\n> > Bitcoin is a decentralized permissionless network\n> \n> \n> \n> Indeed, therefore, nodes runners have the right to have options to protect themselves from this attack.\n\n\"Decentralized\" in this context means the default software is not obligated to accept the approach advocated by a certain group, if it means ignoring criticisms offered by other groups, in other words if a proposal is contentious. Individual node runners, who want to ignore the criticisms of other groups, can certainly make their own choice though, such as via forking (Knots).\n\n\"Attack\" is an inflammatory word to describe people using Bitcoin and paying a bitcoin tx fee to make a type of tx that you do not like. One could choose to describe as an \"attack\" people using ineffective coinjoin software to make many txs that pay tx fees, for example. It's subjective, just like \"immoral\" txs is subjective (gambling inscriptions txs vs. terrorism non-inscriptions txs).\n\n\"Permissionless\" in this context means that because tx fees are being paid, it is not an \"attack\" as far as Bitcoin's design is concerned (tx fee is the anti-DoS mechanism, nothing else, since inherently it is a censorship-resistant network that allows any valid tx). This design also means you have the option to outbid the \"spam attack\".\n\nWe went through this before 2018, or before 2017, when bigblockers were \"attacking\" the network with useless non-inscriptions txs, and the only real remedy was to outbid it. The reason this works is because the offending source has limited funds to spend on tx fees. This applied to bigblockers, and this also applies to gamblers (most inscriptions txs afaik).\n\nOut-bidding is one approach to handle higher layer 1 tx fees, but there are other approaches too, which I listed in my first thread comment (improving layer 1 LN txs efficiency via CTV fork for example, covenants fork which iirc is needed for layer 2 LN-alternative Ark to work properly, increasing efficiency of inscriptions txs to use less bytes, [extension block fork](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-extension-blocks-are-backward-compatible-and-how-theyre-not), a non-contentious block size increase fork based on global median compute / storage / bandwidth / etc., permissionless BitVM sidechains, other permissionless BitVM possibilities, etc.).",

I want to understand your perspective by revisiting a scenario i posed earlier.\r\n\r\n> If i publish a chain of 1000 transactions pointlessly bouncing coins around my own wallet addresses, is that spam? What about a single big (in terms of weight) transaction which only pays from myself to myself? The whole BTC network (including myself) would be better off if i didn't do that. I'm needlessly inflating the fee market for zero utility. In my humble opinion, inscriptions are similarly redundant because they could be done off-chain, so their on-chain utility to the network is near zero as well.\r\n\r\nConsider a two possibilities. Flip a coin, and my wallet will either:\r\n1. Broadcast a 50 kilobyte inscription reveal transaction.\r\n2. Broadcast a 50 kilobyte transaction spending a 1-of-1500 P2WSH `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` output.\r\n\r\n- Today, any wallet with the funds to do so can create either kind of transaction. \r\n- Both scenarios encumber the mempool with the same total weight at the same fee rate. \r\n- Both have identical effects on the UTXO set. \r\n- If mined, both add an equally 'indelible mark', as you put it, to the blockchain permanently. \r\n- Both are unusual but consensus-valid transactions.\r\n\r\nWhat distinguishes these two kinds of transactions in your mind? \r\n",

      "body" : "> If i publish a chain of 1000 transactions pointlessly bouncing coins around my own wallet addresses, is that spam? What about a single big (in terms of weight) transaction which only pays from myself to myself? The whole BTC network (including myself) would be better off if i didn't do that. I'm needlessly inflating the fee market for zero utility. In my humble opinion, inscriptions are similarly redundant because they could be done off-chain, so their on-chain utility to the network is near zero as well.\r\n\r\nNot all spam TXs are the same, but inscriptions certainly are. Sweep transactions moving 1 UTXO from one address to the next do it while trying to economize as much as possible on the fee. They treat sats as money and try to conserve them, therefore they are financial TXs. Same for coinjoin TXs, though some people argue that they aren't financial TXs they also transfer sats trying to economize on the fee as much as possible. All financial TXs have this general look:\r\n\r\n![F_8UsHPX0AAgsIc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/79468022/fb381cd6-ba17-4f0b-8d81-8af0ccedf4eb)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, inscription spam TXs aren't financial. They don't treat sats as money, just as some sort of token to pay for the service they're interested in: inscribing random bytes on the blockchain. These TXs typically spend one output that is just large enough to cover the fees for inscribing the desired data, so 95-98% of the value \"transfered\" is typically lost as fees:\r\n\r\n![F_8UyN4WgAAC8hq](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/79468022/b4526049-b14d-4fbb-a404-f8804944e56b)\r\n\r\nWhen the mempool is clogged with this kind of TXs, users trying to use Bitcoin as money are priced out in droves, because they can't pay 98% of their UTXOs in fees, so they can only compete by moving orders of magnitude more value than inscriptions. Therefore when inscriptions are setting the floor at $10, they're not just pricing out people trying to transact $10 onchain, but also $20, $50, $100.. maybe up to $500. This is a huge externality imposed on transactors trying to use the system as intented, and everyone who uses Bitcoin to transact sats has seen and felt it first-hand for much of 2023.\r\n\r\n![GBIT02LaIAAB8I4](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/79468022/890a1a67-20d4-407a-bf8c-07d4ccf6dc3e)\r\n\r\nThe original Satoshi client didn't allow embedding data onchain, this has always been an exploit. However I think that Taproot may have opened the door to mitigate this forever.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that Schnorr signatures allow stamping data at \"zero footprint\", by hiding a hash inside the signature as if it were some sort of steganography technique.\r\n\r\nMy current view is that in the long term the default mempool policy in Bitcoin Core should be adapted to unstandardize and impose huge fees on all forms of data carrying envelopes to nudge these usages to zero footprint stamping via Schnorr signatures.",

You absolutely could embed data onchain. You could even publish arbitrary data to the UTXO set easily.\r\n\r\nThat was poor wording, but was precisely my point.\r\n\r\nSatoshi designed OP_RETURN as a mechanism to prove that some sats were provably unspendable. Then it turned out that the Bitcoin interpreter was too lax and the OP_RETURN opcode could be used to embed random bytes after it (an exploit), and thus spam filters were deployed to mitigate it.\r\n\r\nBut that's just a very minor point to argue about. What's relevant from the previous message is that it proves that inscription spam prices out the intended users of the system very cheaply (i.e. the fee market is broken). And that Schnorr signatures seems to have introduced the possibility of zero footprint data inscription, so mempool policy should eventually nudge very sternly data inscribers towards this option (i.e. unstandardize and jack up the fees for all data carrier envelopes seen in the wild).\r\n\r\nAnd this PR lays the initial foundation for treating all datacarrier opcode sequences the same, so Concept ACK from my end.",

What is relevant is the fee rate. This information was excluded from the thread's screenshots.\n\nI found similar txs, both in the same block, and this time did not exclude info to paint a misleading narrative.\n\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/11140618/c38efa55-d385-42af-a9bf-19b2e9e4a3f2)\n\nInscription tx:\n- $0.23 value transferred (doesn't include the inscription's value itself)\n- $6.45 fee\n- Fee rate: **104** sat/vB (optimal)\n\nNon-Inscription tx:\n- $2,315 value transferred\n- $18.67 fee\n- Fee rate: 184 sat/vB (overpaid 2x) --> optimal fee rate = **92** sat/vB\n\nBut yes, the presence of inscription txs adds demand and thus competition for precious block space. That's actually the good aspect, since say in the year prior to popularization of inscription txs, it was a network literally relying on subsidy to pay miners -- blocks weren't full, 1 sat/vB fee rate was common, fee-to-subsidy ratio was very low. In short, it was an unsustainable network, which was disappointing for something 13 years old.\n\nAnd no, bitcoin price cannot be relied upon to offset the exponentially-declining subsidy every 4 years, as that is not a conservative approach to security. \n\nWe also can't rely on hopium (vs. evidence) that monetary txs like traditional SoV/MoE will be 100% enough to fill blocks to raise fee rate to an adequate level:\n- SoV txs are by nature infrequent\n- Layer 1 MoE txs are also infrequent because must be higher-value MoE txs for fee to be economical + because MoE with bitcoin is fundamentally not attractive: bitcoin's price volatility, taxes on capital gains and so needing to track and record all txs and calculate gains and do so despite using coinjoin if someone wants tx privacy, lack of consumer protection with reversible transactions, lack of seller adoption compared with credit cards and cash, etc.\n\nThis is why there is excitement (not a \"psyop\"), now that organic free market activity (and not in a bull market, as is usually the case when it happens) is finally producing sustained fees (over 10 months) and thus some meaningful security for the Bitcoin network, and this too only from primitive ordinal inscription infrastructure and early use cases.\n\nWhy fees were cheered, even 6 years ago:\n\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/11140618/1840c268-2ae8-47ae-9e16-7b17ad665613)\n\nThe fee rate level is relevant for individual txs, but security of bitcoin is usually considered in aggregate in terms of total fees-to-subsidy ratio (in an average block in a fixed time period), commonly known as the security budget at least as I interpret it. \n\nI've speculated that an additional approach to security budget is to examine fees-to-marketcap as a percentage, since security need of bitcoin could be logically considered to be based on how much monetary value is being secured: if $800 billion market cap, and if we say 1% makes sense (idk which % would be ideal, maybe it needs more study to figure out, if even it's possible to figure out) as the security budget for paying miners, this means $8 billion/year needs to go to miners in fees (based on napkin math, this equals about $25,000 bitcoin price, based on only assuming 6.25 bitcoin subsidy pays for it without fee contribution, luckily subsidy is still high enough + price is also high enough). If market cap rises to $8 trillion, then 1% is $80 billion in fees to miners ($500,000 bitcoin price if only 3.125 bitcoin subsidy pays for it). Just some examples to show the variables involved.\n\nImagine brains being put to work to really think deeply about what is possible, not just with gambling use case (uninteresting to me, except for the fees generated that improve bitcoin's \"security budget\" for lack of a better term), but as the mental block is removed that treats it as an attack, and thus only can see the \"cons column\" and doesn't look at the \"pros column\", then also with non-gambling use cases...\n\nExample:\n\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/11140618/78b97418-460b-4d95-838b-e2d6ae09b67d)\n\n[https://lnscribe.xyz]()\n\n[https://x.com/polyd_/status/1732456810685083938]()",

The non-inscription tx I cited has a fee % of 0.8%. I don't know what fee % people are willing to pay to make a layer 1 bitcoin tx, but for example digital payments via centralized credit card infrastructure charge about 3% total afaik (to buyer, and to seller who passes cost to buyer). Now, expecting a decentralized expensive PoW network to be competitive with a centralized network in fee % is not fair, but, even if we do this unfair comparison: 2,315 / (3/0.8) = $617*. It means $617 could be seen as a reasonable amount of value to transfer, for a 3% fee to make sense.\n\n2. Layer 2 networks like LN exist for smaller transfers of value that are not economical on layer 1. For example, if every other transaction  value between ~$7 and ~$617* is priced out by ~$7 inscriptions _on layer 1_, then users should transfer value in the range of $7-617, actually between $0-617, via LN instead.\n\n3. I don't know if this is true yet, but just to cover the bases: if even layer 2 LN txs are starting to get expensive (due to cost of layer 1 txs) and not be cost-effective, then it makes sense to advocate for improving LN's efficiency. Maybe LN protocol can be improved in some way without a soft fork, or maybe improvement requires a soft fork like CTV for example for channel factories iirc.\n\n4. If LN is not able to be improved, if it is not as effective as expected, then alternative layer 2 networks should be explored: these days, Ark is getting attention. It needs a covenant soft fork iiuc, and from what I read from people involved, it can at least increase scale by 16x -- unless I'm remembering LN scale improvement, but the point is the same: we can scale Bitcoin txs non-custodially via layer 2 networks, and that requires a soft fork, which is where energy and attention should be directed to achieve tangible improvements. -- The answer is not to expect low-value txs on layer 1 to be economical (I gave an in-depth explanation of why fees are extremely important for Bitcoin's security, in my last reply).\n\n5. As mentioned in a reply some replies back, there are actually layer 1 scaling options too, but we really need to think about whether fees will be negatively impacted (or whether fees will remain because demand will expand to rise to the same fee level, as supply is increased on layer 1, at least to some extent?), since we don't have consistently jam-packed blocks of high-fee rate transactions. So, it's likely better to focus on improving layer 2 networks' efficiency via a soft fork (imagine minimum 16x scale improvement), before focusing on layer 1 scaling (that in some, or all, cases comes with the extra cost of reducing accessibility of mining nodes and non-mining nodes).",

Encrypt the push-data/inscription\r\n2. Format the ciphertext as hashes, pubkeys, and op-code sequences. \r\n3. Encode those hashes, pubkeys, etc into a valid-looking script pubkey.\r\n4. Use that script pubkey as the inscription envelope.\r\n5. Publish the decryption key _after_ the ciphertext is already included in a block.\r\n6. Observers can identify, decode, and decrypt the inscription.\r\n\r\nThe witness script envelope containing the ciphertext is not analytically distinguishable from a normal bitcoin script, until the decryption key is revealed later. Maybe you could use heuristics, like \"having too big of a witness\" or \"fulfilling a certain scripting pattern\" to identify such inscriptions, but you're going to end up with lots of false positives/negatives, and there will always be other workarounds to bypass such heuristics.\r\n\r\nhttps://conduition.io/bitcoin/inviscriptions/",

      "body" : "@conduition thanks for writing that article, it's a very interesting read but I still feel we are not on the same page yet.\r\n\r\nThe point of \"fighting the spam TXs\" is not to prevent all forms of data inscription at all costs, it's to fix Bitcoin's fee market. The crux of the problem as described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408#issuecomment-1852569550) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408#issuecomment-1852673575) is that inscriptions dramatically overpay fees by design and thus price out large segments of Bitcoin transactors at very little absolute cost, thus degrading the monetary properties of the network.\r\n\r\nIn theory with Taproot there is another way to inscribe data onchain that you didn't cover and I alluded to earlier: Schnorr signatures can reportedly be constructed so that they hide some bytes in them, a fact that can be revealed later and anyone can check they were actually there[^1].\r\n\r\nAny technique for data inscription that is so invisible that it's exactly just like another transactor TX is great. Because these TXs won't overpay fees compared to a \"real\" transactor TX (both are real if they have the same layout and footprint). They just need to pay more fees than transactors at the margin instead of shooting straight to 98%, and transactors can do the same to them (IOW both kinds of users would be trying to economize on the fee, not just transactors).\r\n\r\nIn this scenario of equal footing inscribers save a ton of fees, and transactors would actually have a chance of pricing out inscribers if the sound money use case has more demand than generic data storage.\r\n\r\nYour proposal, while it's just bitcoin script (like inscriptions, really), suffers from the same problem as inscriptions, the reveal TXs overpays fees compared to transactors (even more onerously IIUC), so if it picked steam it would disrupt the fee market in exactly the same obvious way, and then would prompt people like me who only care about LN and onchain transacting to e.g. unstandardize the OP_IF opcode as vulnerable. Conversely a chain of 1000 sweep Taproot TXs (1 input 1 output) hiding a chunk of a message in each signature would be fine, etc.\r\n\r\nIMO mempool policy should eventually reflect all that and nudge inscribers to non-disruptive ways to inscribe data. Maybe also by jacking up fees for arbitrary bytes which is an avenue that hasn't been explored until very recently, when Knots v25.1 removed the SegWit discount on inscriptions.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF4Mkkhyz1Q&t=1705s",

They quickly displace the incumbents as an invasive species, as we've seen in 2023.\n> \n> \n> \n> LN channel opening and closing TXs are also economical in that they try to move as many sats as possible while economizing the fee, therefore they're also vulnerable to the spam. E.g. $10k channel closures would be hit very hard by $1000 inscriptions.\n\nI've allowed extra time to ponder, in case I'm not understanding a new argument if it's being made, but it seems there really is no new argument given. So, I'd urge you to carefully reread my full prior reply, as that already comprehensively addressed your point.\n\n- I said the focus needs to be on fee rate, as fee rate determines priority. Some inscriptions txs get the segwit discount, but so do non-inscriptions txs that use segwit. -- And lower-value non-inscriptions txs that get priced out should not have any expectation to be viable on layer 1, regardless if priced out by inscriptions txs now OR higher-value non-inscriptions txs like during bull markets, and so should use other layers like LN. \n\n- And I'll add: Liquid, which has its own set of tradeoffs and can make sense for certain roles, certainly better than custodial LN I'd imagine, as not every segment of payments (like very-low-value payments) benefits from full decentralization (decentralization's censorship-resistance should be used when it is actually needed, as that is when decentralization's inherently higher cost makes sense) -- \"coffee payments do not go on layer 1\".\n\n- I also mentioned advocating LN improvement (if LN still does not work well in a high-fee layer 1 environment that it was supposed to be designed for, despite being in development for what 8 years?), such as via CTV, and LN-alternative of Ark via covenants, which can expand scaling by 16x minimum according to discussion I was reading from people involved. And layer 1 scaling, if none of the other options are enough and if it makes sense.\n\nFinally, I present this new X thread (by Glassnode's Lead On-chain Analyst) with \"counter-intuitive facts about inscriptions\", such as that inscriptions txs \"make up less than 10% of block data size (bytes)\". This seems relevant for improving understanding.\n\n[https://x.com/_checkmatey_/status/1735085770816532554]()\n\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/11140618/4b7ccea6-aa10-4f24-bf37-eb67372ad3af)",

      "body" : "The sheer amount of spam caused by inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain is actually quite alarming, it should be addressed comprehensively, and in a way that dose not harm the BRC-20 market or people's livelihoods. \r\n\r\nSome individuals are not considering the nature of the vulnerability, it has nothing to do with getting rid of inscriptions. It has to do with the network congestion caused by these types of transactions. It's not just a matter of higher fees or slower processing times; this situation poses a deeper risk to the network's integrity. **This vulnerability could potentially be exploited as a vector for DDoS attacks**, perhaps via transaction flooding or something similar. In fact I'm willing to bet that this is not just a theoretical risk but a present and active one. Such a vulnerability, if exploited, could have far-reaching and detrimental impacts that undermines the security and reliability of the entire system.\r\n\r\nThere are also implications for the network's decentralization. Nodes with lesser computational resources may struggle to keep up with the increased demand, potentially leading to a more centralized network topology. This goes against the fundamental ethos of Bitcoin and raises critical questions about the inclusivity and fairness of the blockchain.\r\n\r\nFor a clearer understanding of the magnitude of this problem, I recommend visiting https://bitcoinstrings.com/. This site provides an extensive archive of all ASCII strings that have ever been embedded within Bitcoin's blockchain, similar to what you'd see by running: `cd .bitcoin/blocks/ && strings -n20 *.dat`. \r\n\r\nStarting from [blk03374.txt](https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk03374.txt), the problem becomes increasingly apparent. As you progress through the block files, youâll notice that the ungodly extent of spam caused by this vulnerability worsens significantly, predominantly from BRC-20 inscriptions (e.g. [blk03570.txt](https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk03570.txt) seems to just be flooded and never ending). \r\n\r\nAnother alarming trend that can also be observed alongside this spam, is the disproportionate and excessive storage of large data directly on the blockchain. This includes entire websites, substantial code repositories, JSON data, and even large text bodies like portions of novels. This can be observed up until a certain point, after-which most of the block files will just contain an endless amount BRC-20 json data. This practice of storing excessively large amounts of data directly on the blockchain further exacerbates the already pressing issue of network congestion and raises serious concerns about the blockchain's capacity and intended use as a transactional ledger. \r\n\r\nMost of the data observed before [blk03374](https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk03374.txt) dose not appear to show signs of this sort of spam, with the exception of data found embedded in the blockchain's early history (e.g. [blk00172.txt](http://bitcoinstrings.com/blk00172.txt)).\r\n\r\nThe data embedded in the blockchain clearly indicates that the exploitation of this vulnerability needs to be addressed urgently. It is imperative to develop and implement measures that mitigate these aforementioned risks but **without adversely affecting the BRC-20 market or the livelihoods of those who depend on it**. This calls for a balanced approach that upholds the principles of blockchain technology while adapting to its evolving uses.\r\n",

The crux of the problem as described https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408#issuecomment-1852569550 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408#issuecomment-1852673575 is that inscriptions dramatically overpay fees by design and thus price out large segments of Bitcoin transactors at very little absolute cost, thus degrading the monetary properties of the network.\r\n\r\n> Some individuals are not considering the nature of the vulnerability, it has nothing to do with getting rid of inscriptions. It has to do with the network congestion caused by these types of transactions.\r\n\r\n@1ma @The-Sycorax I strongly agree with both of you on these points. It'd better for the whole network if people simply used [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) or Taproot commitments to prove data provenance off-chain. I would strongly urge any devs who use ordinals to educate themselves, and consider whether off-chain commitment structures like TapRoot or OTS are more appropriate for their use case.\r\n\r\nHowever my point as it relates to this PR is that **preventing the upload of arbitrary on-chain data is practically impossible.** I hope to demonstrate this through [the concept of Inviscriptions](https://conduition.io/bitcoin/inviscriptions/), which are close to uncensorable AFAICT.\r\n\r\nThis is why I concept-nACK'd this PR: It does nothing to address the core issue of mempool congestion. Even if 100% of bitcoin nodes adopt this code, inscriptions of a different form would still persist in the mempool, provided demand for inscriptions also persists.\r\n\r\nThe only practical fixes I can see for the problem of mempool and fee market congestion are:\r\n1. Ask devs who make ordinal/inscription apps to use protocols with more efficient footprints (like OpenTimestamps).\r\n2. Wait for ordinal hype (demand) to die down, so that normal transactions once more outprice them in the fee market.\r\n\r\nThis PR would only erect a minor barrier which forces the ordinals community to construct a new standard for inscriptions. @casey would likely bear the bulk of the workload in shepherding such a transition.",
