   "body" : "This is joint work with amitiuttarwar.\r\n\r\nThis has the first few commits of #28463. It is not strictly a prerequisite for that, but has changes that in our opinion make sense on their own.\r\nIt improves the handling of maximum numbers for different connection types (that are set during init and donât change after) by:\r\n* moving all calculations into one place, `CConnMan::Init()`. Before, they were dispersed between `Init`, `CConnman::Init` and other parts of `CConnman`, resulting in some duplicated test code.\r\n* removing the possibility of having a negative maximum of inbound connections, which is hard to argue about\r\n* renaming of variables and doc improvements \r\n",
