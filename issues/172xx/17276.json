Thank you! â¤ï¸\r\n\r\nThe repo contains 511&nbsp;017 (+17 105) lines of text and 1&nbsp;795 (+16) files.\r\n\r\n21&nbsp;791 (+365) commits have been made of which 4&nbsp;361 (+148) are merge commits.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 282 (-7) open pull requests from in total 82 (-9) contributors.\r\n\r\nIf all open pull requests were merged the project line count would grow by roughly 11 percent.\r\n\r\nThe total set of open pull requests adds 85&nbsp;836&nbsp;lines, removes 28&nbsp;581&nbsp;lines and touches 2&nbsp;541&nbsp;distinct files.\r\n\r\nThe \"median open pull request\" adds 64&nbsp;lines, removes 18&nbsp;lines and touches 5&nbsp;files.\r\n\r\nPrevious edition: [State of the Repo, September 2019](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16967)\r\n\r\n## Static analysis report\r\n\r\nThis is the monthly static analysis snapshot for the [source tree `be504692`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/be50469217bd775c4305938634c32e5932f47841).\r\n\r\n__Note:__ Before submitting any pull requests to Bitcoin Core, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). In particular the section on [__refactoring__](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring), as it likely applies to changes generated with these tools:\r\n> Trivial pull requests or pull requests that refactor the code with no clear benefits may be immediately closed by the maintainers to reduce unnecessary workload on reviewing.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ These results have not been confirmed, and may be improbable or flat out invalid, but it's worth having a list of these somewhere and keep track of changes over time. The results may be subject to a large number of false positives and false negatives. The results are not necessarily complete. Please report if you see any spurious results that you think could be filtered out automatically in the next edition to reduce noise. This report is currently in beta: feedback welcome.\r\n\r\n### Functions that are both unused and untested\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>8 instances
