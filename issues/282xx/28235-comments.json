This should be extremely expensive to do, and more likely a growing data structure merely due to chance stale tips.\r\n\r\nDoes this match your understanding?",

We already bypass the punishment for compact-block relaying...\r\n\r\nIBD I think, where blocks are typically received out of order, and fully validated later. If peers send us blocks then that turn out to be invalid, we probably want to remember these peers to disconnect them.\r\n\r\n[Edit]: on second thought, it doesn't seem necessary during IBD either. Maybe it would be possible to just punish immediately if `AceptBlock()` fails instead of having  mapBlockSource / punishing in `BlockChecked()` callbacks, because situations where someone would create a block that doesn't fail `AcceptBlock()` and only fails during full validation are so expensive that that it's not really necessary to punish that peer?",
