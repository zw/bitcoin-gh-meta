Also, `-reindex-chainstate` seems rare enough to not spend time to optimize its runtime? Going further, if the only goal of `CBufferedFile` is to speed up `-reindex` by 1%, we could consider removing it. Since the implementation is put in the header file of `streams.h`, removing it could reduce peak compile memory usage by .5% and compilation speed by .3% on every fresh compilation IIRC. Obviously this is subjective, but to me it seems a better result.",
