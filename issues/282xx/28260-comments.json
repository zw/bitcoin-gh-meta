If we restrict to (printable characters, or these mentioned in the code), we could then be pretty certain the new code is correct. \r\n\r\nTouching code is always a risk, so I am trying to minimize it.\r\n\r\nFWIW, my code so far: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b77afc50b14ea1af61ea3b32e75d2aa974b07844\r\n\r\n",
