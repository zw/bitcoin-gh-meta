Does that have an index or some other way to compare to this PR?\r\n\r\nHmm I don't think it matches exactly what you are doing here. My backend was built as a \"light client\" itself and with the assumption that it would only index forward looking from a certain activation point. It does create an index but it's not running a full node which means there's a lot of networking happening to services that offer prevout information per transacton. I would be surprised if it would take less than two hours to index the entire chain. Plus I would probably get rate limited before even being able to index the entire chain.\r\n\r\nThat being said I was thinking of upgrading my backend to using a fullnode I could give an update then.",

They're not types like with BIP157 filters, but rather ways to support transactions that have inputs with new script patterns.\r\n\r\nUnless there's no more soft forks, it's quite likely to actually need these new versions. E.g. any new taproot version will need a new silent payment version in order to be able to spend from it.\r\n\r\nThat said, I have not thought at all on how to handle such versioning. Although the `-silentpaymentindex` takes a version number, the index itself doesn't have versioning. I'll have to study the BIP more closely to figure out how versioning works.\r\n\r\nThe most simple solution is to just redesign and rebuild the index by the time that's needed. But if basic versioning can be supported with little code complexity and storage overhead, I would prefer that.\r\n\r\nAdded a note to the PR description to address this. \r\n\r\n> I currently have to set -silentpaymentindex=0 explicitly if I don't want to activate it in this branch\r\n\r\nWill look into that along with the above. The index should be off by default. I probably want the user to set the maximum supported silent paymnets version. That way they won't automatically upgrade later (which might involve increased storage requirements). But since the first version is `0` that's an ambiguous argument. Adding a `v` prefix would be an easy solution:\r\n\r\n* `-silentpaymentindex=0`: index is off (default)\r\n* `-silentpaymentindex=v0`: index version 0\r\n\r\nIn the future, either:\r\n* `-silentpaymentindex=v1`: index version 0 and 1; or\r\n* `-silentpaymentindex=v1`: index _only_ version 1 (makes no sense if the v1 index is a superset of v0, so I have to read up on this)\r\n\r\n> it will need reorg robustness\r\n\r\nThe index is stored and queried by block hash. Each entry is independent (nothing cumulative). So I think it's fine to keep reorged blocks around. But there should be a test to make sure the new block is added.",

What is the motivation to let users run an older version of the index explicitly even though they have a newer version available in their node and the newer version isn't missing anything? I don't see a good reason for it aside from maybe storage space. So then I think the index should be either on or off and it will be updated with every softfork to accommodate for the new types once the softfork activates. That way there is also no reindex needed if users upgrade their nodes in time. We could do explicit versioning in this scenario if it helps to simplify things I am not sure it's even needed.\r\n\r\nAnd if the storage argument is really something that matters, then I don't see why we wouldn't treat it just like blockfilterstypes. It seems much simpler to have separate indexes for each of these new softforks/silentpayment versions rather than deal with all the compatibility stuff inside a single index. That would also make sense in light of the storage argument: If I am just starting to use silent payments with segwit v5 then I don't care about the silent payments that were maybe done before on older segwit versions and I could save a lot of space if I can just run `-siltentpaymentindex=5` or so.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Is it an issue with the second suggests path that senders can theoretically send to any version after taproot and the receiver can not control it? In that case I guess the first path makes even more sense because then there is really no reason for receivers to run with an older version of the index.",

      "body" : "I was tinkering around with this and had a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* Being able to specify a `start_height` sounds like something that would be generally useful for all indexes, not just this one. I've been toying with the idea of what it would take to have a \"pruned\" txindex and I would need to be able to start from a specific height for that. @fjahr I took the branch you started and got it working with a little tinkering here: https://github.com/josibake/bitcoin/tree/add-start-height-to-base-index . With a little more work this could probably be it's own PR. Feel free to grab this branch, or I can open a PR if you're busy with other stuff!\r\n* I wanted to see how difficult it would be to make this as a new `BlockFilterType`, and it was way easier than I thought it would be. The blockfilterindex code is really well designed! I copied the SP logic from this PR and got a hacked together working branch here: https://github.com/josibake/bitcoin/tree/implement-bip352-blockfilterindex (this syncs on my laptop in < 1 hr on mainnet and ends up being around 1.5gb on disk)\r\n\r\nWith the `blockfilterindex`, all we would need to do is propose a new filter type BIP and everything Just Works (TM) for light clients that support BIP157. I don't see any easy way to \"prune\" this index to only have data for the UTXO set.. but I also don't see a way to easily do that with a general index like we have in this PR either. I'm also less convinced this matters (for right now), and more worried we might be prematurely optimizing at this stage.\r\n\r\n@Sjors brought up some good points about versioning, but I can see that working with a block filter index in that we would just propose a new filter type for new version types (fine, so long as we don't frequently update silent payments versions), or if we do find ourselves needing to frequently update the version we just build versioning into the encoded filter e.g. return data for all versions and let the clients figure it out, or split up the encoded filter into sections with version bytes? \r\n\r\nCurious what you guys think on how to proceed, @Sjors @fjahr. In my mind, it makes more sense to go with a custom index if we have a clean way to support pruning to the UTXO set, and we'd also need to think about how to make this index available to light clients. If instead we go the blockfilterindex route, we get all the infrastructure for supporting light clients for free (and fast wallet rescans), but probably more difficult to build in custom logic like SP versions and UTXO pruning, since the blockfilterindexes are somewhat rigid in how they are built.",

      "body" : "> Being able to specify a start_height sounds like something that would be generally useful for all indexes, not just this one. I've been toying with the idea of what it would take to have a \"pruned\" txindex and I would need to be able to start from a specific height for that. @fjahr I took the branch you started and got it working with a little tinkering here: https://github.com/josibake/bitcoin/tree/add-start-height-to-base-index . With a little more work this could probably be its own PR. Feel free to grab this branch, or I can open a PR if you're busy with other stuff!\r\n\r\nHm, I don't think it's clear that it's generally useful. Not starting from the genesis block doesn't work for `coinstatsindex` because it's accumulating values from genesis on. I also don't think it works for the current `blockfilterindex` because the headers build a hashchain similar to block headers. `txindex` would work in theory but I think we would need to check everywhere where it's used to ensure error handling is consistent for this use case, because that would then mean just because a tx isn't in the index doesn't mean it doesn't exist which is probably implied right now.\r\n\r\nEach of these could be fixed if we had a way to get the starting point but I think it would be pretty intrusive also for `coinstatsindex` and `blockfilterindex` to handle not having values for certain blocks due to a specific start height.\r\n\r\nIn terms of usefulness for a next blockfilter type, I don't think it's a strong argument right now because nobody is proposing a new blockfilter type and if somebody proposes it, it's also possible that it might be interesting to have it from genesis. And then there are also conceptual questions: If we have a new filter type for a new type of script that is introduced in the future it makes sense to not have a filter but maybe we still want to have a header chain with empty filters up to the block where it starts to get interesting (for security reasons)?\r\n\r\nI would rather keep this scoped to silent payment index for now because there is a clear use case and I don't see any pitfalls like with the other indices. It can be a separate PR but I would suggest calling it a precursor to this PR.",

      "body" : "Considering that we only want to check if one of the outputs is P2TR, using Solver in this situation seems to be a potentially expensive tool (it does the matching for all standard output types and returns data that we never need). Thinking of e.g. txs that have dozens or hundreds of bare multisig outputs, this could be much slower. I'd suggest to use a simple fast-test here instead, e.g.:\r\n```suggestion\r\n            const CScript& spk = txout.scriptPubKey;\r\n            return spk.size() == 34 && spk[0] == OP_1 && spk[1] == 0x20;\r\n```\r\n(could introduce this as `CScript` method `IsPayToTaproot`, very similar to the already existing [`IsPayToWitnessScriptHash`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/98005b6a17907c4f7bdcf802ee96c274492f902a/src/script/script.cpp#L216-L222))",

This does mean that if a light client rescans, it will not find its own spent transactions. I remember there being a discussion some time ago, and I believe it was seen as a reasonable trade-off to not find ones own transaction history in favor of saving a lot on bandwidth and computation (maybe @josibake can chime in here). But yes, as far as I know, one would have to keep a full index in parallel or set a flag on spent tweaks in some way.\r\n\r\nAs a note to that.

A light client that is completely restored from seed and has to do a complete rescan would be unable to find UTXOs that were re-sent to an address. The new tweak for that tx would not match the scriptPubKey, the old tweak would be gone and the scriptpubkey would go unnoticed because those would not be available in a recovery from seed.\r\n\r\nI agree that this case should be considered in the specification. Or at least a discussion for light clients would be good in order to think about these kinds of trade-offs and pitfalls. Has there been a discussion in this direction already?\r\n",
