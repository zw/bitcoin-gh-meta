Ultimately, if I want to send 10.5 bitcoin to you, and I have 500 UTXO:s of 1 BTC each all sending to A, the grouping part should result in 50 groups of 10 random UTXO:s each (each group worth 10 BTC), and two of these should be selected when sending, and ALL of the outputs should be marked as used afterwards.\r\n> \r\n> Your code seems to change this behavior to only result in one 10 BTC group per destination, which means the above send will result in \"insufficient funds\".\r\n\r\nMy code does handle this case correctly. You describe the behavior that would occur if I had implemented it as @achow101 suggests. The \"full groups\" (10 outputs) are already pushed into `groups` [earlier](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17824/files#diff-b2bb174788c7409b671c46ccc86034bdR3992) and only the \"incomplete\" group of <10 outputs would be added [later](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17824/files#diff-b2bb174788c7409b671c46ccc86034bdR4006). So we are collecting all the full groups but skip the last one if it is not full.\r\n\r\nHowever, your comment made me realize another shortcoming of the current code: If there are 11 outputs of 1 BTC and we want to send 10.5 BTC then we see the insufficient funds error because we are \"forgetting\" the incomplete group. To fix this I would suggest implementing the following: the last, incomplete group, is pushed into one of the full groups, resulting in one of the groups being up to 19 outputs large. \"Worst case\" scenario that I see: we want to send a very small amount from the destination and we have exactly 19 outputs, then we would use all the 19 outputs. I think this should be ok? I will wait for your feedback before pushing the code for it.\r\n\r\nSee adapted tests I ran with the current code for the examples discussed above: https://gist.github.com/fjahr/d56b68e58b4275ef52cd5f4eb50b1d4e",
