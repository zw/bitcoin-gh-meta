   "body" : "This PR does two things:\r\n\r\n* Fixes a privacy issue where if we relay a transaction to peer A (but not peer B), peer B can request the transaction and we'll provide it.  Instead, we should wait until we announce to peer B before providing the transaction.\r\n\r\n* Respond to getdata requests for transactions that are ancestors of newly-announced transactions.  Currently, our software will request the parents of an orphan transaction from the peer who announced the orphan, but if our peer is running a recent Bitcoin Core version, the request would typically be dropped.  So this should improve propagation for transaction chains, particularly for nodes that are just starting up.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a test that transaction chains relay to peers that weren't connected when a parent was broadcast.",
