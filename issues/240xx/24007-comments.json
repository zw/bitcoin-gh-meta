Though, until the contrary is corroborated by periodic probing of miner's mempools, I think we can reasonably hold the assumption they're.\r\n\r\nSo to simplify, I lean to account witness replacement in fee estimation as early as this PR.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?",

Could you please give an example?\r\n\r\nThere's some discussion of the motivations in #19645 but one simple example I can mention here involves Taproot. You may know that there are two ways to spend a Taproot output, the _key_ path or the _script_ path. The key path requires all participants to be in agreement with the spend and has a smaller witness. But suppose there is an absence of unanimous agreement, requiring broadcasting a transaction with an input using the script path (which has a large witness). While it's in the mempool, agreement is reached, and the transaction is sent again but this time using the key path. It's beneficial to the miner (in terms of feerate) and to the transaction participants (in terms of privacy and confirmation speed) if this second version of the transaction can replace the first, as this PR enables.\r\n\r\nI believe this can happen when L2s (such as LN) integrate the use of Taproot, but I don't understand the details.",

In LN you might broadcast a unilateral close (sending to a timelocked output) because your counterparty is unresponsive. Then your counterparty comes back online and you agree to do a cooperative close to replace the unilateral close with no timelocked output. But the transactions aren't identical so you wouldn't be able to make use of this.\r\n\r\nI agree in principle that it makes no sense to prevent someone from using a smaller witness if for whatever reason they previously broadcast a larger witness than was necessary.

This all seems very theoretical to me, and there are both code complexity concerns as well as anti-DoS concerns around using the network to relay transactions that never get mined.  So if some protocol is relying on coordinating signatures for transactions by relaying messages on the bitcoin network rather than communicating over some other channel, I think we should be skeptical and carefully evaluate whether this makes sense.  Does the bitcoin p2p network really need to serve as a communication medium for layer 2 protocols to construct efficient transactions?\r\n\r\n> Right. So for this to be consistent, those \"current rules\" would have to change. That's either safe or not. If not, then it isn't safe to do for this case either.\r\n\r\nI believe this proposal is equivalent to reducing the minrelayfee for witness-replacement transactions by approximately a factor of 20 -- you could imagine someone constructs a transaction with bloated witness which just meets the minrelayfee, and then repeatedly replaces it, dropping the size by 5% each time, resulting in using nearly 20x the bandwidth for the same total fee expended.\r\n\r\nPresumably the 5% number could be changed to accommodate a more (or less) conservative bandwidth limit, but I don't know how we should be picking it without knowing what use cases we are trying to support in the first place.  So I tend to concept NACK, at least until we understand concretely what those use cases are.",

If an attacker submitted the same transaction with incrementally smaller witnesses 20 times, could the node not accept (or relay) the new transaction if the one it's replacing was accepted and relayed less than so many seconds ago? Maybe implement an exponential backoff policy by requiring an ever-greater delay before accepting the next version of the same transaction.\r\n\r\nIt's true that the total required bandwidth would be the same, but if it's spread out over many minutes or hours, it would be less of a practical DoS threat.",
