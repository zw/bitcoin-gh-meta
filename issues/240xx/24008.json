Various pieces of net_processing logic have to be modified in order to support block download that is simultaneous across numerous chainstates.\r\n\r\nChanges include\r\n\r\n- Modify FindNextBlocksToDownload() to parameterize the chainstate\r\n  being worked on.\r\n\r\n- Change GetNodeStateStats to take the max nCommonHeight per peer across\r\n  all chainstates.\r\n\r\n- Add CNodeState::chainstate_to_last_common_block\r\n  * we need this to allow handling for a single peer to distinguish\r\n    between separate chainstates we're simultaneously downloading blocks for\r\n\r\n- Share `requests_available` across chainstates when finding the next blocks\r\n  to download (during calls to FindNextBlocksToDownload()).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR shares commit https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/commit/17906dd52543fb75d2c45de884799b35ec5721f4 with #24006, and is included here so that the two changes can be reviewed in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis PR excludes a small net_processing commit, https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/commit/3e6164d96f9a42ecbf34359f6fd1af5413346933, which will be proposed for merge after #24006 since it relies on the introduction of the `BackgroundBlockConnected()` validationinterface event that the indexing changes introduce.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome commits here are best reviewed with `--ignore-space-change`.\r\n\r\nUnit-testing net_processing is notoriously difficult and with that in mind I haven't included any unittests here, but in parallel with review of these changes I will attempt to write some tests. Note that this behavior is covered in the functional tests included in the parent PR: https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/commit/c4949f2daf05289e76123b3c705277bf735a79d6",
