   "body" : "This PR' aim is to improve user experience around stuck transactions without\r\naffecting users of zero conf transactions.\r\n\r\ntldr: Allow transaction replacement for transactions sitting in mempool for\r\nlonger than timeout (default 6h configurable) regardless of opt-in replacement\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nThis PR affects policy/relay only.\r\n\r\nStuck transactions have been a problem for users recently. While wallets\r\nare improving (opt in replacement, Child Pays For Parent, etc) there are some\r\ncases which find users with transactions stuck for days that can't be solved\r\neasily/reliably by wallet developers, especially when the user creates the\r\nstuck transaction with old software or for some reason disabled available\r\nfeatures countering stuck transactions.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the below I will ignore transactions created by the core\r\nwallet when talking about transaction expiration/eviction and focus on policy.\r\n\r\nBitcoin 0.12 introduced (or in a way re-introduced) opt-in transaction\r\nreplacement (BIP125), allowing people to more explicitly flag that their\r\ntransaction can be replaced (such that users of zero conf transactions can\r\nimmediately recognize them).\r\n\r\nAt the same time mempool limiting (configurable) was introduced, making the\r\nindividual mempool drop transactions at the bottom (low fee) when full.\r\n\r\nBoth before and after these changes any transaction in mempool would be\r\nautomatically evicted after 72 hours (configurable).\r\n\r\nRecently 0.14.0 increased the eviction from 72 hours to 2 weeks. These changes\r\nallows users of the system to aim for lower fees but at the same time makes it\r\nfrustrating for users that disable opt-in transaction replacement or that use\r\nsoftware that doesn't support it in first place to bump the fee at a later time\r\nor to revert the payment as they have to wait for a while or use ad-hoc\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nA number of miners will mine transactions regardless of opt-in flags (5-10%\r\nmaybe) and while core nodes won't propagate those transactions, a well\r\nconnected user can generally get replacement transactions mined within a\r\nreasonable amount of time without opt-in transaction replacement flags set.\r\n\r\nThis may be convenient for attackers or ad-hoc expert use but\r\nnot ideal for wallet developers, or at least until core merges full transaction\r\nreplacement because using this functionality would requires wallets to use\r\npreferential peering and/or forks of bitcoin core.\r\n\r\nUntil then a compromise solution that doesn't impact zero conf use and that\r\nimproves user experience would be to allow transactions to be replaced after\r\nsitting for a timeout in mempool (thus unconfirmed).\r\n\r\nThe timeout should be high enough that allows current use of zero conf and at\r\nthe same time allows same working day solution for users.\r\nI suggest a 6 hours timeout and to have it configurable for testing and ability\r\nfor user to change.\r\n\r\nThe changes continue to support disabling entirely transaction replacement\r\n(-mempoolreplacement) and introduces a new command line parameter\r\n(-mempoolreplacementtimeout) which allows to pass the number of seconds after\r\nwhich a transaction can be unconditionally replaced and setting this parameter\r\nto two weeks will keep the original behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test the changes using @petertodd Replace-by-Fee tools build\r\ncore with this PR applied and wallet enabled and run with\r\n-mempoolreplacementtimeout=10 and use doublespend.py (with and without\r\n -b 1) from https://github.com/petertodd/replace-by-fee-tools",
