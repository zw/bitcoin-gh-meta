   "body" : "For merge after v0.15 (**or perhaps as a bugfix for v0.15**)\r\n\r\n1. Adds better validation of bitcoin-cli wallet argument to make sure it is only specified once, and that is only ever picked up from the command line, not from a config file (which could have bad results if someone was writing a script and forgot a command line argument).\r\n2. Renames -usewallet to -wallet\r\n\r\nIf there is zero or one `-wallet` argument in bitcoin.conf (ie single wallet mode), **there is no change from pre-0.15 behaviour**. No `-wallet` argument is required for bitcoin.cli.\r\n\r\nIf there is more than one `-wallet` argument in bitcoin.conf (ie multiwallet), then a single command-line `-wallet` argument must be provided to bitcoin.cli.\r\n\r\nIt is always an error to specify more than one `-wallet` command line argument, and the request will be rejected by bitcoin.cli on the client side.",
