      "body" : "@jonasschnelli Cool idea for collecting metrics by using CScheduler and offer the data in an rpc interface. But it is a little complicated to manage the stats metric series, it brings more codes to handle the metric storage and collecting interval. Just offering the metric itself not the history is simple, and leave the history collecting to other tools is more decoupled for operator who runs commercial service.  Indeed both the ways would bring invasion to the orginal code, but it is unavoidable for this kind of feature.",

(i.e. leveldb log sizes, high processing latency of REST APIs, etc).\r\n\r\nEven if one doesn't use prometheus, but different monitoring system, it should be VERY easy to write adapter as prometheus metric access system is very simple but at the same time rich.\r\n\r\nHaving statistics like that also provides opportunities for optimizations, by better understanding behaviour of the code in production. (i.e. cache hit rates, various failure counters, etc), as well instrument code with counters and gauges in consistent way, that can be used both for monitoring, alerting, but also testing.\r\n\r\nIt is a core feature, and do not constitute a fork in any reasonable way.",
