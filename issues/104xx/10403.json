   "body" : "An off-by-one-block bug in importmulti rescan logic could cause it to return\r\nsuccess in an edge case even when a rescan was not successful. The case where\r\nthis would happen is if there were multiple blocks in a row with the same\r\nGetBlockTimeMax() value, and the last block was scanned successfully, but one\r\nor more of the earlier blocks was not readable.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed by changing the `CWallet::ScanForWalletTransactions` return value to point to the last failed block that could not be rescanned, and then updating the `ScanForWalletTransactions` call in `importmulti` to use the new return value.",
