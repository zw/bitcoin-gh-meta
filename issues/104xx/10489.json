Unfortunately, it's too easy for a warning in one header to cause dozens of repeated warnings.\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/10/wimplicit-fallthrough-in-gcc-7) for details.\r\n\r\nIf it were just our code, I'd add in the (non-standard) annotations. But it's also an issue in leveldb and tinyformat, and would require substantial autoconf hackery to avoid.\r\n\r\nFwiw, None of the existing warnings turned up are real bugs.",
