Didn't separate s/BIP9SoftForkDescPushBack/VBSoftForkDescPushBack/ because I don't think it's worth it: it helps for review IMO and it's minimal).\r\n\r\nPlease no merge before we decide what to do with my new TODO comment lines (I want to add something to bip8 for warnings), but I think review for bip8 as it is now can begin at any time.\r\nKudos again to @shaolinfry not just for the idea but also for the cleanness: I enjoyed reviewing and rebasing this.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nThis modifies the original BIP specification to enable warnings for unkown deployments being locked in by bip8 timeout as proposed in https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014417.html\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce static DoWarning (simplify UpdateTip) #10464",
