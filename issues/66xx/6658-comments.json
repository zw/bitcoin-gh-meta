This avoids any kind of conversion.\n\n@unsystemizer see https://gist.github.com/laanwj/108877a28ec03836568a\n\nIn general I recommend to use cross-compiling to build for resource-constrained systems. This a) avoids having a compiler toolchain on the target b) is much faster c) Bitcoin Core's depends system makes this easy.\n",

Is there a way to make the compiler use less than e.g. 200 MB RAM per process?
