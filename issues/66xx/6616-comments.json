However the BUILDDIR is not compatible with native windows  (ie /c/bitcoin) and is not handled well by python so I had to keep the scripting that finds the builddir.  Therefore there are a few options moving forward:  1)  Keep the scripting that finds the builddir...I made changes so that it uses the system path rather than the os.path so we don't have to be in the pull-tester folder to run the scripts.  (2) I can do an os specific hack to normalize the builddir for native windows (3) if we could somehow find a way to put the native os path into the tests_config.py directly but I don't know how...I'll research this a little more tomorrow, any suggestions are welcome...",
