After some time though, bitcoind seems to recover and the sequence of requests can be attempted again, but the pattern repeats (high number of requests fullfilled at first, then gradually becomes slower and slower)\r\n\r\nInterestingly, bitcoind's memory usage doesn't grow, and remains more or less constant during the whole process. Its CPU usage also doesn't grow, but instead seems to be proportional to the rate of the responses it gives. Looking at the CPU usage, you can see high usage at first (when the rate of requests is high), and then the CPU usage gradually declines.\r\n\r\nThis looks to me like bitcoind is really sleeping (or waiting for something) for some time before, during or after completing the request.",
