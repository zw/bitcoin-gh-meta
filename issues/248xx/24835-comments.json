Considering that they deal with the address used for self-advertising (and thus for getting incoming connections) I don't really understand why they make use of `IsReachable()` in the first place. Shouldn't this affect only outbound connection logic?\r\n\r\nvasild's [answer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22834#issuecomment-914265670):\r\n\r\n> I think the logic is this - if a network is not reachable then we cannot accept connections from it. \"Reachable\" in the broader English word meaning, not the stricter -onlynet meaning. For example, a host/OS may have support for both IPv4 and IPv6 but its ISP may only support IPv4. So, an operator would run -onlynet=ipv4 to avoid attempting connections to IPv6 hosts and from advertising an IPv6 address to which the rest of the world cannot connect.",

I wanted to double check with `-netinfo` but to my surprise only my ipv4 address was shown. However, I noticed that I was still receiving inbound connections on my onion address (i was previously running the node without `-onlynet`). That seemed inconsistent to me so I opened this PR.\r\n\r\n> we will advertise it to other peers (bad? or at least a significant change in behavior)\r\n\r\nWould we though? afaict we try to announce the address that is best reachable for our peer. So for example, if we connect to a peer through IPv4 and we have a local IPv4 and IPv6 address, we won't announce the IPv6 address to that peer (See [GetLocal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e88a52e9a2fda971d34425bb80e42ad2d6623d68/src/net.cpp#L158) and [GetReachable](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e88a52e9a2fda971d34425bb80e42ad2d6623d68/src/netaddress.cpp#L748), we sort by reachability). TBH it does not seem super obvious to me which address we choose for advertising so i might be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe description of `-onlynet` states \"Inbound and manual connections are not affected by this option.\" but not advertising an address does affect inbound connections (you won't get any or only a few if you previously advertised your address).\r\n\r\nI think my main problem was the display issue and adding a \"listening but not advertised addresses\" section seems OK to me.",
