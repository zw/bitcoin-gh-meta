      "body" : "In terms of lengths, and for more general context on this issue so that reviewers can avoid duplicating work:\r\n\r\n- `struct sockaddr` is an old 1980's generic socket address type, (made with IPv4 in mind). It's like a base class.\r\n- `struct sockaddr_in` (\"internet\") is the IPv4 \"subclass.\"\r\n  - It has a size that fits within `sockaddr` and its layout is such that the two can be cast back & forth. In C. In C++ it's UB to manipulate aliased unrelated types like that.\r\n- `struct sockaddr_in6` is the IPv6 \"subclass.\"\r\n  - It is larger than `sockaddr`\r\n  - But the API still works with `sockaddr*`. It's up to you and the API to cast the pointer to the appropriate \"subclass\" once you know which protocol you're dealing with.\r\n- `struct sockaddr_storage` was added along with `sockaddr_in6` as a \"catch-all\" opaque blob that is large enough to hold either one. The only field defined on the struct is the `ss_family` field (i.e. is this IPv4 or IPv6?). That field is guaranteed to map to the field in all the other versions so it's \"sort of\" castable.\r\n\r\nSo, in this PR here's the strategy:\r\n- On our side, if we need a socket address type that is protocol-independent, make it `sockaddr_storage` instead of `sockaddr`. Makes sure we have a big enough chunk of memory to work with, and it removes some internal casting.\r\n- For writing to out-variables of `sockaddr_storage*`, first we zero all the memory of the out-variable to get a clean slate, then create a protocol-specific local variable e.g. `sockaddr_in` and populate it, then memcpy the smaller subclass variable into the zero'd storage variable.\r\n- Replace downcasts of `sockaddr*` -> e.g. `sockaddr_in*` with creating a local variable of the appropriate type and memcpy'ing using the \"subclass\" length. This looks like a read out of bounds but it's no more out-of-bounds than casting the smaller struct pointer to the larger one was. It's the same thing really.",

Is that right?",

      "body" : "> The remaining casts to `sockaddr*` are unavoidable and safe because we are calling into the external C APIs which expect us to do that cast.\r\n\r\nI understand the \"unavoidable\" but I don't understand the \"safe\". Do you mean that it is safe just because it goes to external C API? I made the following experiment which shows the opposite (both with gcc 12 and clang 15):\r\n\r\n* `s.h`\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct S1 {\r\n    int x;\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct S2 {\r\n    int x;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `f.c`\r\n```c\r\n#include \"s.h\"\r\n\r\nint f(struct S1* s1, struct S2* s2)\r\n{\r\n    s1->x = 5;\r\n    s2->x = 6;\r\n    return s1->x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `main.cc`\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"s.h\"\r\n\r\nextern \"C\" int f(S1*, S2*);\r\n\r\nint main(int, char**)\r\n{\r\n    S1 s1;\r\n    std::cout << f(&s1, (S2*)&s1) << std::endl;\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile with `-O3` and `5` is printed. Change the type of the second argument to `S1` and `6` is printed.\r\n\r\nI think the `bind(2)` API, strictly speaking implies UB, but it is safe because the `bind()` function never does something like the above, nor we do before passing it the argument.\r\n\r\nThere is an example in [`bind(2)`](https://linux.die.net/man/2/bind) which interprets `sockaddr_un` as `sockaddr` - that is also UB according to the standard of strict aliasing rules<sup>[1](https://gist.github.com/shafik/848ae25ee209f698763cffee272a58f8)</sup> <sup>[2](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/02/the-joys-and-perils-of-c-and-c-aliasing-part-1)</sup>, right? What about `memcpy()` where we cast anything to `void*`, also UB?\r\n",
