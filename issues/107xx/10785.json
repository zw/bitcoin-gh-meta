   "body" : "This PR improves correctness (removing potentially unsafe `const_cast`s) and flexibility of the serialization code.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that use of the current `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` macro (which is the only way to not duplicate serialization and deserialization code) only expands to a single class method, and thus can only be qualified as either const or non-const - not both. In many cases, serialization needs to work on const objects however, and preferably that is done without casts that could hide const-correctness bugs.\r\n\r\nTo deal with that, this PR introduces a new approach that includes a `SERIALIZE_METHODS(obj)` macro, where `obj` is a variable name. It expands to some boilerplate and a static method to which the object itself is an argument. The advantage is that its type can be templated, and be `const` when serializing.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the various serialization-wrapping macros (`VARINT`, `COMPACTSIZE`, `FLATDATA` and `LIMITED_STRING`). They all `const_cast` their argument in order to construct a wrapper object, which supports both serialization and deserialization. This PR makes them templated in the underlying data type (for example, `CompactSizeWrapper<uint64_t>`). This has the advantage that we can make the template type `const` when invoked on a `const` variable (so it would be `CompactSizeWrapper<const uint64_t>` in that case).\r\n\r\nA last issue is the persistent use of the `REF` macro to deal with temporary expressions being passed in. Since C++11, this is not needed anymore as temporaries are explicitly represented as rvalue references. Thus we can remove `REF` invocations and instead just make the various classes and helper functions deal correctly with references.\r\n\r\nThe above changes permit a fully const-correct version of all serialization code. However, it is cumbersome. Any existing `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` instances in the code that do more than just (conditionally) serializing/deserializing some fields (in particular, it contains branches that assign to some of the variables) need to be split up into an explicit `Serialize` and `Unserialize` method instead. In some cases this is inevitable (wallet serializers do some crazy transformations while serializing!), but in many cases it is just annoying duplication.\r\n\r\nTo improve upon this, a few more primitives that are currently inlined are turned into serialization wrappers:\r\n* `BigEndianWrapper`: Serializes/deserializes an integer as big endian rather than little endian (only for 16-bit). This permits the CService serialization to become a oneliner.\r\n* `Uint48Wrapper`: Serializes/deserializes only the lower 48 bits of an integer (used in BIP152 code).\r\n* `VectorApplyWrapper`: Serializes/deserializes a vector while using a custom serializer for its elements. This simplifies the undo and blockencoding serializers a lot.\r\n\r\nBest of all, it removes 147 lines of while code adding a bunch of comments (though the increased use of vararg `READWRITE` is probably cheating a bit).\r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered into 3 sections:\r\n* First, introduce new classes that permit const-correct serialization.\r\n* Then one by one transform the various files to use the new serializers.\r\n* Finally, remove the old serializers.\r\n\r\nThis may be too much to go in at once. I'm happy to split things up as needed.",
