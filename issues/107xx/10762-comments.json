You could delete the `WalletInitSignals` struct and replace the `WalletInitSignals` global variable with a `std::unique_ptr<WalletInitInterface>` global. This would get rid of all the boost signals code and make the control flow simpler.\r\n\r\nAlso you should prefix global variables with `g_`. And I think this PR would be less error prone and simpler to review if you just left the init code in wallet.cpp for now and moved the relevant functions to walletinit.cpp in followup MOVEONLY PR.\r\n\r\n",

But I think I'll do it the other way round - first move the wallet initialization/destruction functions into their own `walletinit` translation unit, and then introduce the interface class in a second PR. The reason is that #10740 is built on walletinit.cpp so this PR and #10740 will no longer be interdependent.",

      "body" : "@jnewbery Hmm, I see the benefit, but generally when introducing interfaces I'd rather design it well up front (as opposed to, say, leaving a hack in some implementation until it can be cleaned up later). Especially if there's another proposal for a similar, general interface in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10973, I think this could warrant some more thought. On the other hand, it might be easier to design the right general interface later when extracting other things behind interfaces.\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky Thoughts on how easy/likely it will be to switch the WalletInitInterface out for a more general one at a future date?",
