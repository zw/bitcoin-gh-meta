We've had plenty of issues with otherwise innocuous shell script changes breaking dash-based systems, not to mention BSD incompatibilities, plus now WSL, so there is nontrivial review for some of these things, if its just because they are prettier or feel nicer, I really think we should cut back some of these changes.",

The requested squashing was perhaps a bit premature. I'll squash again when the only ACK:ed changes remain :-)\r\n\r\nThe remaining changes are:\r\n\r\n1. **Remove unused variables**\r\nRationale: Obvious mistake corrected.\r\n\r\n2. **Remove \"\\n\" from echo argument. echo does not support escape sequences.**\r\nRationale: Obvious mistake corrected - `echo \"\\n\"` prints a backslash, the letter n and a newline.\r\n\r\n3. **Add error handling: exit if cd fails**\r\nRationale: Obvious mistake corrected - missing error handling.\r\n\r\n4. **Add required space to [[ -n \"$1\" ]] (previously [[ -n\"$1\" ]])**\r\nRationale: Obvious mistake corrected - the syntax is `[[ -n STRING ]]`, not `[[ -nSTRING ]]`.\r\n\r\n5. **Fix incorrect quoting of quotes (the previous quotes had no effect beyond unquoting)**\r\nRationale: `echo \"1 \"2\" 3\"` prints `1 2 3` and not `1 \"2\" 3`. Change to `echo \"1 \\\"2\\\" 3\"` where quotes are intended in the output.\r\n\r\n6. **Use bash instead of POSIX sh. POSIX sh does not support arrays.**\r\nRationale: Assumptions are better stated explicitly than implicitly :-)\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt How do you feel about the remaining changes? All of those clear fixes? :-) ",
