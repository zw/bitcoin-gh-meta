      "body" : "@emilengler  Thanks for giving it a try! But I think the benchmarks you are comparing are not well suited in this case. I assume you are running a standard regtest network, maybe generated a few hundred blocks and made some transactions by hand. In this case the UTXO set is very small and iterating over it will be extremely fast, so that it would not surprise me if there is no measurable upside to using the index (maybe it will be even a little slower as you saw). But the goal of this index is that the time of the call will stay constant for a realistically sized UTXO set. So a better indicator would be to try it on a synced mainnet or testnet node, where `gettxoutset` currently takes several minutes without the index, even on pretty high powered hardware.\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky  Sure, I will go along the different statistics the call provides to highlight which ones I think are more or less important:\r\n- `total_amount` The total amount of the current bitcoin supply. Tracking this number on a continual basis allows users to detect potential inflation bugs, such as CVE-2018-17144 (Example: [Bitmex Research](https://blog.bitmex.com/forkmonitor-unexpected-inflation-detection-and-warning-system/)). I think all users should be given the chance to continually check this, even on more affordable hardware. I am currently running a mainnet node on an Odroid HC2 and `gettxoutsetinfo` takes 7min 50s. Specs are roughly comparable to a Raspberry Pi 4, so it can keep up well with the chain otherwise. If I wanted to run a continual inflation detection on this hardware, I would not be able to do so when the UTXO set has grown another 20-25% (ignoring hashrate fluctuations).\r\n- `hash_serialized_2` The serialized hash of the UTXO set can be used for a quick comparison of the UTXO set between different notes. Essentially, it can be a stand-in for the latest blockhash and compared for sanity checks. BTCPayServer has been using it for their [FastSync](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker/tree/master/contrib/FastSync) feature, which will probably be replaced with `assume_utxo`, where a UTXO set hash (not necessarily this one) will play a role as well. I still need to sync up with @jamesob  about the latest plans for the hash and how this proposal can be compatible with his or even help/support it.\r\n- `txouts` The total number of unspent outputs is an interesting number to track from an operations standpoint. Users can see if coins are being consolidated or at which rate the UTXO set is growing. Example: [satoshi.info](https://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/unspent-transaction-output-set)\r\n- `bogosize` and `disk_size` might be also interesting to track but not as actionable, disc usage is probably much more efficient to collect from the OS\r\n- `transactions` it seems to be a nice-to-have metric that does not serve any real purpose afaict, as @sipa also noted\r\n- `height` and `bestblock` can be ignored since they are available from other RPCs, but are necessary to compare numbers between different machines\r\n\r\nFor future use cases (aside from integration with `assume_utxo` potentially) I don't have specific ideas yet, but it opens the door to track any other statistics of the UTXO set or block content in the index. So it may collect further metrics of interest where users currently parse the block data with their own custom software.",

      "body" : "@emilengler did you actually start `bitcoind` with `-coinstatsindex`? I mention it briefly in the PR description, but as @ryanofsky already pointed out as well, I need to do a much better job at documenting the intent and current state of the proposal. It seems so because otherwise you could not test it that quickly, building up the index takes a quite long time and while the index is building up `gettxoutsetinfo` is responding with \"unable to read UTXO set\". In fact, on my machine, it is currently so slow that I might have to address it. But running a plain IBD is also incredibly slow right now so it could also be a local issue. What is probably happening is that you are running `bitcoind` without the flag and so the stats are still calculated by iterating over the UTXO set but the hash is using the new hashing algorithm (Muhash), which is slower and results in slower performance when not using the index.",

      "body" : "First of all, thanks for taking early looks and comments @ariard , @ryanofsky, @emilengler , @jnewbery (offline). Your comments should be mostly addressed in the latest code changes and in further information below. With the latest fixes and performance improvements, this should be now ready for real review and testing.\r\n\r\n# Short recap of changes (this changed slightly)\r\n- Introduces `MuHash3072` and `TruncatedSHA256Writer` implementations (code by Pieter Wuille)\r\n- Uses above for MuHash hashing alogrithm for the UTXO set hash in `gettxoutsetinfo`\r\n- Removed tracking of the transactions count statistic\r\n- Introduces `CoinStatsIndex` class, an index for all the statistics in `gettxoutsetinfo`\r\n- Allows activating the index using the flag `-coinstatsindex`. When activated `gettxoutsetinfo` responds within seconds after the initial sync phase. Otherwise it works as before but will be slower to parse the UTXO set due to the change in the hashing algorithm.\r\n\r\n# Benchmarking\r\n- For reference, on my benchmarking server and my local machine, IBD takes around 18-19 hours\r\n- I can provide more detailed numbers if required but so far I am pretty confident that it's not a bottleneck even for users on under-powered nodes.\r\n\r\n## How long does the sync of the CoinStatsIndex take?\r\n- On my benchmarking server syncing the Coinstatsindex after IBD took between 8.5 and 9.5h hours\r\n- On my local machine, I also synced testnet and it took 8h 20min.\r\n\r\n## How about the growth of the UTXO set (ariard's question above)?\r\n- For the sync time of the index should actually not make much of a difference if the UTXO set shrinks or grows, it should rather grow linearly with the size of the blockchain.\r\n- Instead, growth of the UTXO set causes `gettxoutsetinfo` without the index to run longer because it iterates over it every time and so it is one of the reasons why I think the index is worth integrating into core.\r\n\r\n# TBD\r\n- Although its a lot of LOC I think the changes are still ok to be reviewed as one PR but if people would prefer me to split it into two or three smaller PRs that is easily doable.\r\n- The newly introduced metric `coins count` that is only used in Assume UTXO is not in the index and I don't think there is a practical way to integrate it (similar problem to transaction count). That means it will probably not be possible to have this index running and create a new assume utxo set on the same node at the same time. I will need to discuss this with @jamesob  to make sure this dealt with correctly one Assume UTXO is finished.",

      "body" : "I came up with do_muhash because I needed the contrary term to undo_muhash. Since we are talking about rolling back a block that has 'do' (utxo created in the block) and 'undo' data (utxos destroyed in the block). I was thinking if I should reverse these terms when a block is removed or keep the terms the same as they were when the block was added. For me it seemed less confusing to keep the naming the same as when the block was added. So 'do' data that was added when the block is added still called 'do' data when the block is rolled back, just that the 'do' data is removed from the utxo set this time. Either way I probably confusing so I will keep adding comments to make this more clear.\r\n\r\nI should add that I only need these intermediate values because division is much slower than multiplication. Since these operations are cummutative I can multiply all the values that need to be removed from the muhash and then remove them all with just one division.",

      "body" : "Hm, it's a good question. I have not questioned it beyond the fact that it's a neat way to document height and coinbase in one uint32. fCoinbase doesn't make a difference for BIP30 because those were all coinbases and the duplicated txs are filtered earlier already. So I don't see a reason why we would need the information but if we can have it without taking up any extra space, why not? I think based on the commit message here I would guess the reasoning is that this information should be added to hash and it was added in one to minimize change: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/d342424301013ec47dc146a4beb49d5c9319d80a",

Maybe @practicalswift can add a fuzz harness?\r\n\r\nHappy to work on a fuzz harness myself, I am trying to get some more experience with it :)\r\n\r\n> [b208dfd](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b208dfd5712bdc658217c84d276d82e92cb2cf47) `Add TruncatedSHA256Writer` needs a test.\r\n\r\nI am currently a bit unsure of what the right way to go is for this. A first observation is that `CHashWriter` is also untested. I think both these classes are pretty thin wrappers of the actual hash functions they use, so a test might not provide much value. But `TruncatedSHA256Writer` does a bit more, so I think it could still be valuable to have a sanity check test. I was looking for any test vectors provided for [SHA-512/256](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/548.pdf) and while there are is no official set, at least [these](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines/documents/examples/sha512_256.pdf) could be enough for a sanity check. However, the problem is that for SHA-512/256 different initializers are used. We reuse SHA-512 for simplicity reasons, I guess. It's easy enough to add the other initializers. I am just not sure it worth the additional review effort. Another fact that I stumbled over, is that the serializer used here is writing the null character of a string into the hash, where I am not sure if that is a bug but it certainly makes working with test vectors hard.\r\n\r\nSo, I am not sure if adding SHA-512/256 is worth it. And I am also unsure if a test for `TruncatedSHA256Writer` would be valuable without test vectors and given the only limited logic inside the class.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to get input from @sipa here. \r\n \r\n> I think you can safely squash [f59d222](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f59d2223199d26ef591d9a3fc3282b19a4cb833a) into the original and make yourself `Co-Authored-By`? You're not changing the algorithm.\r\n\r\ndone\r\n\r\n> I'm currently running [cf6ba16](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/cf6ba169ae1999a98db831900d36e0571a9d933d) and building a mainnet index on macOS 10.15.4. I'll update my comment with an example result from a recent block. I ran the first 100K blocks with `--enable-debug`, stopped and continued without debug.\r\n> \r\n> Concept ACK on dropping transaction count from `gettxoutsetinfo`. \"The number of transactions with unspent outputs\" seems a useless metric. If someone does have a use case for it, hopefully we'll learn before the release. In that case it could be added to `getblock`.\r\n> \r\n> I got very confused by the indexer code in [8e17009](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/8e17009dcc4de977ced030e624b18ecc6ba19e63), sorry for any dumb questions...\r\n\r\nI will try to add more comments to make it easier to understand.\r\n\r\n> If it's not too big a code change, adding a `height` argument to `gettxoutsetinfo` would unleash the power of this index, and also make it easier to compare hashes between reviewers. It also makes it easier to manually compare against the hash generated without an index (with something a bit more complex than the functional test).\r\n\r\nDone, I had planned to do this as a follow-up anyway and with the removal of some duplicate code, the number of LOC has hardly grown.\r\n\r\n",

But I think to keep the hash in a different index and letting users set these with separate settings might be too much responsibility for the users. I would suggest a more opinionated approach. Rather than having `-coinstatsindex=none` and `-coinstatsindex=muhash` later I would suggest it stays `-coinstatsindex` and at first there would be no hash and users would only get a fast response when they use `hash_type=none`, then muhash can be added to the index and users will then be receiving responses from the index with `hash_type=none` and `hash_type=muhash`. Personally I think we don't want to have a lot of hash types, too much unnecessary choice for the user. I think we use this now to support hash_serialized_2 for some time and maybe also to run ECMH in parallel but ideally we should be ending up at one hash_type that is the default and most of the other options can probably be removed.\r\n\r\nI will prepare the alternate PRs with only `hash_type=none` and I hope I can make so people are not totally confused by all the different PRs. :)",
