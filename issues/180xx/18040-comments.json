      "body" : "I asked @apoelstra about Miniscript in Core at his London Bitcoin Devs talk on Miniscript. A summary (paraphrasing) of his response. \r\n\r\nCore should have the ability to sign for Miniscripts and to recognize Miniscripts it has control over. There are plans for Core to support Miniscript in the descriptor wallet which directly implies Core has to be able to finalize and sign them. A general PSBT finalizer effectively means there is a RPC where you give it a PSBT and Core is able to output a transaction.\r\n\r\nThe Policy to Miniscript compiler should not be in Core. That doesnât even necessarily have a canonical design. There are some interesting fee estimation and analysis tooling that probably donât belong in Core. Those probably belong in their own library or their own RPC tool or something like that. Core should be able to estimate fees for its own stuff but you probably shouldn't be able to ask whether keys are available or trusted in Core due to complex scenarios that only Miniscript is designed to address.\r\n\r\nFull transcript: https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-02-04-andrew-poelstra-miniscript/",
