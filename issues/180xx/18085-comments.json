After entering the passphrase, it deflates/decrypts metadata, keypools, descriptors into memory only.\r\n* A password re-entry when spends happen could still be made (eventually with the short inmemory timespan KDF-ed key)\r\n* Enter the passphrase more often (at startup / load-time of a wallet plus additional timeout) prevents from lost funds through lost passphrase.",
