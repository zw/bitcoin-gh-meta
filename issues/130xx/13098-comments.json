How difficult would it be to serve the data directly from disk, without serialization/deserialization roundtrip?\r\n\r\n~~Edit: to do this efficiently would require a change to the on-disk format to add the size, or adding the on-disk block size to the block index.~~ OH this is actually already there, situated before the `nPos`:\r\n```\r\n    // Write index header\r\n    unsigned int nSize = GetSerializeSize(fileout, block);\r\n    fileout << messageStart << nSize;\r\n```",

As it has const fields, conversion to other transaction types will be expensive if it's ever needed, but it does get the ability to take advantage of more efficient storage if they get implemented (like one malloc per transaction).\n\nOverall, I think my preference is to reuse CMutableTransaction here, but if we want the extra guarantees and an extra type, the current approach seems fine.",
