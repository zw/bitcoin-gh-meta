We should remove the `-rescan` argument.\r\n\r\nThere's interaction between `-rescan` and `-zapwallettxes`/`-salvagewallet` (both of those options imply `-rescan`. It'd be (marginally) easier to remove `-rescan` once those two options have been removed.\r\n\r\n",

I'm assuming here that nobody uses these commands in an automated environment, so we're not breaking anyones setup by just removing this from `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\n2. Wallet creation options\r\n\r\nAlso agree that `createwallet` RPC should be used to create additional wallets, as well as for anyone who wants their default wallet to be different than the default (yikes, that's a bad sentence). I propose an additional creation option in #14938 (empty wallet).\r\n\r\n3. Wallet config options\r\n\r\nWe could add `[wallet]` specific sections in `bitcoin.conf`. Those could either override `bitcoind` arguments, or we could disallow these `bitcoind` arguments if any [wallet] section exists.\r\n\r\nOnce  #11082 is merged, it should be easy to update wallet-specific settings in config files, rather than in the payload (though I'm not fully convinced storing settings in the payload is bad).\r\n\r\nI do wonder if `spendzeroconfchange` and `txconfirmtarget` are really wallet specific things, or rather more of a mempool weather dependent global preference.\r\n\r\nIn general I'd really like to avoid having a given setting _both_ global and with wallet specific overrides.\r\n\r\n4. Wallet module options\r\n\r\nIf we add descriptor support to wallets, and assuming new wallets won't use `combo()` descriptors, then `-addresstype` and `-changetype` could safely remain global (wallet module) settings. Their meaning would then decide which descriptor to use by default when creating a new wallet, and if a wallet has multiple address type descriptors, it could pick the default for `getnewaddress` (which would fail if the descriptor type isn't present in the wallet).\r\n\r\nThe keypool might disappear altogether, so that could remain a global option for pre-descriptor wallets.",
