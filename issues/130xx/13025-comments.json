It's just a passion project for me -- the only thing better than perfect code is no code at all.  I have a collection of homegrown tools I have built over the years, and I use them in a tech debt consultancy I operate (sadly still no public showcase yet).\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky - I didn't mean to imply that they were vestigial at the time of move-over.  I saw your commit that moved them, then verified that the functionality existed in the wallet in current HEAD and axed it at that point.\r\n\r\n@laanwj - for the record I really liked the architecture-abstracted cycle counter utility, I see you are the one who added it.  My view is that the current tree should be kept to the minimum possible working set, and good code can always be brought back from the git history if needed.  To me code removal is not a statement on its usefulness, but instead a statement on if it is used.",
