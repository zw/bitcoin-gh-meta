There doesn't seem to be any consistency on this screen for where to hover to see the tooltip.  I've draw highlight boxes on a screenshot approximately where hovering shows me a tooltip.  This seems like a somewhat pre-existing inconsistency only made slightly worse by this PR.  (Debian 9, QT5 used)\r\n     \r\n    ![pr13043-dialog-highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61096/39314794-152f5a54-4943-11e8-9075-3a1efce8b55c.png)\r\n\r\n2. The message that *a restart is needed before the settings takes effect* disappears after 10-15 seconds, which seems weird (but is probably pre-existing behavior).\r\n\r\nEverything else seemed to work as expected on this previously-pruned node after restart.",

I can press `alt+s` to tick the first checkbox. However, this is the only element in this screen which has 2 things which would need a shortcut: the text and the input box.

Once checked, tab can be used to reached all thee input fields on that screen.\r\n\r\nI don't see any way to address \"Needs to not add a QSettings prune option\" other than #12833 or #13029, so unless there is a better idea out there this PR will likely be stuck for a while.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli:\r\n> I also think it should be labeled as \"target\" (something we want to reach but not sure we can).\r\n\r\nBit of a cop-out, but I think the tooltip \"Actual disk usage may be somewhat higher\" encapsulates that.",
