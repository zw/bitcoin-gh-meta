   "body" : "For the wallet's unit tests, we currently use either `DummyDatabase` or memory-only versions of either BDB or SQLite. The tests that use `DummyDatabase` just need a `WalletDatabase` so that the `CWallet` can be constructed, while the tests using the memory-only databases just need a backing data store. There is also a `FailDatabase` that is similar to `DummyDatabase` except it fails be default or can have a configured return value. Having all of these different database types can make it difficult to write tests, particularly tests that work when either BDB or SQLite is disabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies all of these different unit test database classes into a single `MockableDatabase`. Like `DummyDatabase`, most functions do nothing and just return true. Like `FailDatabase`, the return value of some functions can be configured on the fly to test various failure cases. Like the memory-only databases, records can actually be written to the `MockableDatabase` and be retrieved later, but all of this is still held in memory. Using `MockableDatabase` completely removes the need for having BDB or SQLite backed wallets in the unit tests for the tests that are not actually testing specific database behaviors.\r\n\r\nBecause `MockableDatabase`s can be created by each unit test, we can also control what records are stored in the database. Records can be added and removed externally from the typical database modification functions. This will give us greater ability to test failure conditions, particularly those involving corrupted records.\r\n\r\nBased on #26690 for the database cursor changes.\r\n\r\nPossible alternative to #26644",
