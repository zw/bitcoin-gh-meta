   "body" : "Currently `migratewallet` migrates the address book (i.e. labels and purposes) for watchonly and solvable wallets only in RAM, but doesn't persist them on disk. Fix this by adding another loop for both of the special wallet types after which writes the corresponding NAME and PURPOSE entries to the database in a single batch. Also adds a corresponding test that checks if labels were migrated correctly for a watchonly wallet. \r\n",
