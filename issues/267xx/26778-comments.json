I saw #[22235](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22235) was merged on May 4th, but I am working on a download of bitcoin core from yesterday, so my download should be completely up to date. I ran your code.\r\n\r\nIn:\r\n`% contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh`\r\n\r\nOut:\r\n```\r\nfatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\r\n/src/bitcoind not found or not executable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoving forward: \r\n1) I think it makes more sense to have `bitcoin.conf` in the main repository rather than being buried deep in the `share/examples/` directory because burying it would make it difficult to call and add complexity; and\r\n2) It probably makes sense to focus on a solution to the core pathing problem, rather than doing a work around.\r\n",

The macOS Build Guide says it could take days to download the blockchain, but I have already completed this download. However, I downloaded Bitcoin Core earlier this year and have the GUI from the [Bitcoin Core Website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/). It is located in my `Applications` folder, but I have yet to find a way to access it from the terminal or interact with the underlying software. \r\n\r\n1. Is it necessary to download the blockchain twice to make software contributions?\r\n2. What is the reason that the `Applications` folder appears empty through the terminal, but full of applications through the GUI?\r\n3. How do I access Bitcoin Core in the `Applications` folder for the purpose of software development?\r\n\r\n",

To be clear, the pathing problem refers to problems in installing the software with a proper path for running and contributing code. I did my best to describe the problem, so if you're still having issues on clarity or the words seem like a mish-mash, you may want to get checked for [dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia), a disease a lot of really smart people have that makes it difficult to derive clear meaning from otherwise cogent text.\r\n\r\nThe text of this thread is designed to create a clear path, address problems, and ultimately a solution for proper installation on macOS. The request will be resolved when I have added the feature and made the proper contribution. Ultimately, this thread adds a lot of value to the network by identifying and addressing core software problems face by new developers and contributors to Bitcoin Core. Thanks!",

And, I asked what the difference was between usage and support? Without knowing how you define the words, I don't know what you think they mean. \r\n\r\nYes. The issue is that there is no clear way to correctly install the bitcoin software with clear pathing on macOS. The issue stems from issues in downloading software to macOS generally, especially with the new M1 chip. The goal is to provide a clear download mechanism to allow developers to get started building faster. I've been working on this problem for about four days now and still am not able to run `./bitcoind`.",
