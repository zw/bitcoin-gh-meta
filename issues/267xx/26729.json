   "body" : "I've noticed that the fictional unit 'kvB' is used in Bitcoin Core.  I looked into this for a few months and couldn't find a single standard or even mention of a unit called 'kvB' anywhere online.  Even the old kB notation used in Bitcoin is incorrect.\r\n\r\nPretty much everyone agrees on that **Bitcoin** is referring to the unit size of **bit**.\r\n\r\n**1024 bits ((2<sup>10</sup> bits) bits)** is equal to **1 kibibit**, and is represented by the symbol **Ki**.\r\n\r\nGNU/Linux users are well acquainted with the symbols **KiB** and **MiB**, which stand for Kibibyte and Mebibyte, respectively. \r\n\r\nSome of the recent pulls that introduced this issue in Bitcoin:\r\n@MarcoFalke https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/6da3afbaee5809ebf6d88efaa3958c505c2d71c7\r\n@jonatack      https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/94f83534e4b771944af7d9ed0f40746f392eb75e\r\n\r\nWhile I am not a member of the Bitcoin organization on GitHub, **I request that this issue be assigned to me** because I would like to contribute to Bitcoin Core by resolving this issue.
