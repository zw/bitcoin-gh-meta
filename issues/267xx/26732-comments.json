Thanks, it's BIP125 rule 2.\r\n\r\nThe wallet can create invalid transactions due not be contemplating that neither.\r\nSame as with the other case, could happen on any of the \"send*\" and \"fund*\" RPC commands, when the user preselects an output that is being used as input for another unconfirmed transaction.\r\n\r\nSo, added test coverage and internal checks for it as well.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nNow this PR adds support and test coverage for two different scenarios where the wallet creates invalid transactions.\r\n\r\n1) If is creating a replacement tx; in the available coins fetching process, the wallet need to skip the outputs that corresponds to the transaction being replaced (those coins are no longer going to exist once it's replaced, there by they are not \"available\").\r\n\r\n2) Prevent adding new unconfirmed outputs to the transaction being created/funded If any preset input was already spent by a mempool transaction.

      "body" : "> > So far, what the test proves is that the wallet, during the transaction creation process, can automatically select outputs from the unconfirmed transaction that is being replaced to use them as inputs. Which shouldn't happen as those coins will no longer exist once the tx gets replaced.\r\n> \r\n> Indeed this sounds like a bug that should be fixed. Would it be better to stop + warn the user that they have selected an input that is already spent by something in this mempool, and, if this is intentional, they should use `bumpfee` RPC instead? Otherwise you end up implementing RBF checks in 2 places?\r\n\r\nThat is a good point and topic.\r\n\r\nAnother point of view would be to understand `bumpfee` as the `sendtoaddress` of the replacement transaction creation commands: the simplest and most straightforward way to create a replacement transaction, where regular users provide few inputs and the command just work. Without almost any possible customization etc.\r\n\r\nThen, under this rationale, instead of blocking replacement txes from happening in lower level commands like `fundrawtransaction`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt` etc, it might be good to unify code (not duplicate the checks, which would be ugly for sure) and enable the same RBF validations on other processes too.\r\nOnly performing RBF checks if the crafted/funded transaction has at least one already spent input somewhere else (which only could happens if the user manually preset the input/s).\r\n\r\nWhich, based on a brief walk-through the bumpfee process, might not be that bad as we are duplicating some code that is already inside the general fundtransaction function.\r\n\r\nThen, for advanced users, this view might be more adequate as otherwise we would need to add more customization options inside `bumpfee` so it provides almost the same functionality as the other lower level commands (e.g. be able to bump a tx that have at least one input that does not belong to the wallet, be able to add new confirmed inputs manually, modify an output value, provide an input weight manually, among other \"not standard for bump txes\" flows that advanced users might want to do).\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nStill.. have to say that this comes from an out loud thinking.. atm, I don't have a strong preference over any approach:\r\n The blocking approach is reasonable as it would make our life easier for the time being but then, if users start requesting tx customizations, we will end up adding lot of stuff into `bumpfee` that is already somewhere else. Which will force us to unify code anyway.",

Other wallet works have gotten more priority than this working path. This two PRs are still bugs within the wallet but they could wait a bit in favor of other PRs.\r\nI don't have a fixed time to get back to this work, but will try to do it after new year. We should be able to merge few of the ongoing big PRs by then.",
