   "body" : "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main improvements to package evaluation here:\r\n(1) We submit transactions with their in-package ancestor sets.\r\n\t-  See unit test `package_ppfp`: without this change, we would reject everything.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_ppfc`: shows that this doesn't let us do \"parent pays for child;\" we only do this when the individual and ancestor feerates meet mempool minimum feerate\r\n(2) We linearize the package transactions based on ancestor set scoring.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_needs_reorder`: without this change, if we use the original order of transactions, we would only accept 1 grandparent, even if we submit subpackages.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_desc_limits`: without this change, we accept one of the lower-feerate transactions (a bit more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" example).\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",
