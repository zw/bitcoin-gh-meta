   "body" : "Restoring a wallet backup from another chain should result in a dedicated error message (we have _\"Wallet files should not be reused across chains. Restart bitcoind with -walletcrosschain to override.\"_ for that). Unfortunately this is currently not the case for legacy wallet restores, as in the course of cleaning up the newly created wallet directory a `filesystem_error` exception is thrown due to the directory not being empty; the wallet database did indeed load successfully (otherwise we wouldn't know that the chain doesn't match) and hence BDB-related files and directories are already created in the wallet directory.\r\n\r\nFor bitcoind, this leads to a very confusing error message:\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli restorewallet test123 ~/.bitcoin/regtest/wallets/regtest_wallet/wallet.dat\r\nerror code: -1\r\nerror message: filesystem error: in remove: Directory not empty [\"/home/thestack/.bitcoin/wallets/test123\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven worse, the GUI crashes in such a scenario:\r\n```\r\nlibc++abi: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::__1::__fs::filesystem::filesystem_error: filesystem error: in remove: Directory not empty [\"/home/thestack/.bitcoin/wallets/foobar\"]\r\nAbort trap (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFix this by simply deleting the whole folder via `fs::remove_all`. With this, the expected error message appears both for the `restorewallet` RPC call and in the GUI (as a message-box):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli restorewallet test123 ~/.bitcoin/regtest/wallets/regtest_wallet/wallet.dat\r\nerror code: -4\r\nerror message:\r\nWallet loading failed. Wallet files should not be reused across chains. Restart bitcoind with -walletcrosschain to override.\r\n```",
