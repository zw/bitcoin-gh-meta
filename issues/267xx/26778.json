   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nYes. One common problem with software setups is the pathing is corrupted. Proper pathing is one of the most important parts of getting started with any new software because if the path is depreciated the software will not properly run. This is the problem I am currently working on with Bitcoin. I downloaded the software but am unable to interact with the network.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# In\r\nbitcoin-cli getblocktemplate '{\"rules\": [\"segwit\"]}'\r\n# Out\r\nzsh: command not found: bitcoin-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be clear instructions on how to install and get started using Bitcoin software that did not require extensive knowledge of software systems architecture and pathing. A great installation method would automatically install the software along the right path to prevent the pathing problem. A generalized solution would be really good, providing a clear guide to solving the pathing problem on any machine.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI've researched solving the problem in the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5365321.0) and on [StackOverflow](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/43148/bitcoin-cli-not-found-on-osx). However, because this common problem is so unique to each local machine, a clear or generalized solution is hard to develop. One specific solution I tried from my research was to add additional context to the command.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# In\r\n> curl --user username --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\": \"curltest\", \"method\": \"getblocktemplate\", \"params\": [{\"rules\": [\"segwit\"]}]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/\r\n# Out\r\n> curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8332: Connection refused\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the command resulted in a connection refusal. I found a possible solution in the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5155612.0), but the problem with the proposed solution is that there is no `bitcoin.conf` file in the main Bitcoin repository. I found a `config` folder in the `src` directory, but there is no `bitcoin.conf` file. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI am running on MacOS. Thank you in advance for your attention and advice.\r\n",
