But probably I could in this case create multiple transactions without inputs using `createrawtransaction`, then fund each of them separately with `fundrawtransaction` and then use `combinerawtransaction` to create final transaction to be signed and sent out. Will try to implement and test it, how it works. Probably this new RPC proposal is useless then.",

So, decided not doing that.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm now thinking it's actually not such a good idea to implement new RPC if there are no other use cases for it. But probably this issue could be kept open, if somebody comes up with them in future.\r\n\r\n> Not sure about the use_bnb option.\r\n\r\nProbably not a good idea to export such option via RPC, as different coin selection algorithms may come and go in future.",
