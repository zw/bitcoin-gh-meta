   "body" : "This adds a new optional build executable called `bitcoin-wallet-unlock`. This program invokes [Pinentry](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.en.html) (part of GnuPG) to securely read the user's wallet passphrase. This is intended to be used by users of `bitcion-cli`, as `bitcoin-qt` already reads wallet passphrases securely.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nNormally parameters to Bitcoin RPC methods are passed as program arguments to `bitcoin-cli`. This is insecure for `walletpassphrase` for two reasons:\r\n * The passphrase will be leaked to other processes via the command name, e.g. another user running `top` or `ps` might see the passphrase in the clear.\r\n * In all likelihood the command invocation will end up in the user's shell history.\r\n\r\nA commonly cited workaround is to use `bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase`. In this mode the command arguments are provided to `bitcoin-cli` over stdin, and this allows the user to enter a passphrase (and timeout) without the issues described above. However, it is still not perfect, as `bitcoin-cli` keeps stdin in `ICANON` mode. This means that if you literally type `bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase` and enter a passphrase and timeout value, the passphrase you type will be echoed on the terminal in the clear. Another person shoulder-surfing will be able to see the cleartext passphrase, as can any process doing a screen capture.\r\n\r\nPinentry solves this problem and a few others. When reading from the TTY, Pinentry disables echoing to the console, which means that shoulder-surfers can't see the passphrase. Pinentry has some other nifty features. For example, if you invoke pinentry from a terminal emulator in a graphical session in most cases it can automatically upgrade to a graphical input method, e.g. using GTK. This is what input looks like by default for me in GNOME when running `bitcoin-wallet-unlock` from a terminal: https://monad.io/bwemqwkg.png\r\n\r\nThis implementation of `bitcoin-wallet-unlock` allows using `-p` to force a particular pinentry backend, and `-t` to force TTY input. Extra arguments passed to `bitcoin-wallet-unlock` will be forwarded to the underlying pinentry program; there's an example of this in the comment for `GetPinentryPassphrase()`. Communication with Pinentry is done using a limited subset of the assuan protocol, which is described [here](http://info2html.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/info2html-demo/info2html?(pinentry)Protocol).\r\n\r\nThese are the caveats I know of with this PR:\r\n * Since the HTTP client code in `bitcoin-cli` isn't well factored, I am just execing `bitcoin-cli`, rather than actually making the RPC request from the `bitcoin-wallet-unlock` program. This feels a little bit hacky, but minimizes code churn.\r\n * The default behavior is to use a relative path for `bitcoin-cli` and `pinentry` when calling `execvp()`. This could potentially cause a malicious program to be invoked if an attacker can put bad things in the users PATH. This can be mitigated by invoking `bitcoin-wallet-unlock` with absolute paths, e.g. `bitcoin-wallet-unlock -c /usr/bin/bitcoin-cli -p /usr/bin/pinentry`.\r\n * Graphical pinentry methods can delegate to a desktop password manager (e.g. with `gnome-keyring-daemon` on GNOME) when pinentry is linked with libsecret. That is a cool feautre, but I don't enable this because I don't think it's secure (it's trivial to dump the plaintext passwords with these once you're logged in as a user).\r\n * This code is not portable to Windows as it uses `pipe()` and `exec()` (although I suspect most Windows users are using `bitcoin-qt`).",
