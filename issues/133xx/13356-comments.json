But I figured for Bitcoin the compatibility is sufficient across most linux distributions so as not to require recompilation per-distro. Perhaps it depends on what kinds of changes miners are compiling in...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanyways, I'm indifferent on if to upgrade to 14 or not (the changes in 14 are relatively minor and low advantage compared to say, 17).
