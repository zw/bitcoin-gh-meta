      "body" : "So...this adds the option to specify the rpcuser/pass at runtim instead of via -rpcuser/-rpcpassword.  I like this.  \r\nHowever, why use ASSUAN? Assuan takes care of mlock() and such, but how hard is that, really, to do ourselves?  I'm not a huge fan of adding *another* dependency, though I suppose the fact that it is optional is nice.  If we are just using the cli input from assuan, and not all their other wx stuff, how hard would it be to copy/paste the probably 20 relevant lines from assuan, or rewrite them ourselves?\r\n\r\nASSUAN might be useful for wallet crypto, where the user needs to enter their password via GUI and I have yet to find a way to mlock() the password as the user enters it, but even still, the attack which mlock() protects against is almost never seen in the wild.  Assuan is designed to be a secure method of IPC, but in this case it is just used as a password entry library.  Assuan might be very useful for something like libbitcoin, but for bitcoin it seems like far over-engineering.\r\n\r\nMaybe Im missing something you can point out?",
