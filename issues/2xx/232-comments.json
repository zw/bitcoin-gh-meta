All that serves to do is increase the number of copies of keys you have in memory and increases your attack surface.\r\n\r\nSecurity-wise: careful, minimal code > paranoid code.

So it's much harder to parallelize an attack with, e.g., an ASIC, as you would need lots of RAM to do so.\r\n\r\nBut I agree with you: There have been much more reviews of the SSL code base, and so the chance of critical errors in OpenSSL is much lower compared to scrypt.",
