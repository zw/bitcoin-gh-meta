Some extra information:\r\n\r\nI usually have ~32 connections in bitcoin.  Receive seems to be fine.  After 10 mins the current bitcoin.exe connections have downloaded about 100kB each, but, download is usually not as limited as upload.\r\n\r\nAfter about 10 mins the current bitcoin.exe connections use about 100kB upload each, but, there are ~3 which uses ~1MB+.  This comes to over 10kB/s average (not much average wise).  But I suspect when those 1MB+ guys are going it uses 100% of the upload and just drops down to 7.5kB/s average after that part is done.\r\n\r\nPreferably I'd like to limit upload to 2kB/s to 5kB/s on my current connection.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I'm using bitcoin 0.3.24-beta",

If you happen to hit a throttled node when syncing, syncing will be slow.\r\n\r\nOf course, but isn't the sync slow if you hit a node that has limited bandwidth?  You don't magically get a fast sync just because you don't allow nodes the ability to throttle.  The problem is that if you don't allow throttling, then you get *no* node because people just turn it off.\r\n\r\nAfter a while of people just turning it off, then you start getting massive sync load on the system because people need to sync hundreds (or thousands) of blocks whenever they want to do a BTC transaction.  Instead of the lightweight sync load that happens in realtime, you have a small (but significant) number of people that require loads of bandwidth all at once.\r\n\r\nHence the problem.  If we could just leave BitCoin turned on at low bandwidth, then we wouldn't have the sync issue.\r\n\r\n> Instead, I think we need a \"non server\" mode (some checkbox, perhaps asked on first startup), which disables serving (historic) blocks, disables listening (by default) and disables NODE_NETWORK (so nodes don't announce themself as full noes). This means people can still do the validation and relaying part of being a full node, but without the bandwidth implications of serving the full chain.\r\n\r\nMaybe.

If we enable bandwidth throttling without that, the chance of accidentally hitting a slow node would increase, while if we remove those nodes from the pool altogether, the chance for that decreases.\r\n\r\nPeople fully shutting down nodes because it saturates their data link is of course bad. Throttling or disabling serving would improve that, but you're close to the resources you're willing to spend, perhaps you shouldn't run a full node in the first place.\r\n\r\nJust relay of new transactions and blocks is typically quite low bandwidth - it's just when you get hit by a node that is syncing from scratch that you suddenly get an upload burst. \r\n\r\nAbout over-engineering: the ability to run a pruned node is an inevitable evolution somewhere in the future, in my opinion, and it would also imply a solution to your problem anyway.",

I have a decent connection, something like 300-500KB/s upload.  Luckily i've managed to catch it most times and I open up a network monitoring tool and kill the ports in question (always bitcoin-qt).  I have to be careful because if it ran at that speed for a long period of time, not only would my net be slow but it will quickly consume my data quota.\r\n\r\nSo now instead of running a full node for ~8 hours a day I let it sync with the network and then shut it down.\r\n\r\nIf I had a throttle option, I would set it at something like 50KB/s upload.. this is faster than I ever use when downloading the latest blocks (CPU bound).\r\n\r\nI think this is a problem, I would like to run a full node, but will not while it consumes 100% of my upload majority of the time.",

      "body" : "For anyone wanting to reduce the impact of their bitcoin-qt client, I've created a quick-fix, which minimizes the traffic while I'm using a wifi network that charges per megabyte. This patch adds a command line option, so that the client downloads only blocks and not transactions, and doesn't upload anything other than the transactions that you create. The downside is that this isn't healthy for the network as a whole, won't display transactions that you're monitoring from elsewhere until they're included in a block, and reduces anonymity in that you'll only broadcast your own transactions and not anyone else's. Also, the alert feature is disabled also, so you won't see alerts for urgent upgrades (not that this was reliable anyway in the case of the recent 0.8 hardfork!).\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be toggleable from within the GUI or even able to automatically switch on and off depending on which ISP you want it to activate with, IMHO.\r\n\r\nOh, here is the abovementioned branch: https://github.com/rebroad/bitcoin/commits/MinimizeTraffic\r\n\r\nI still maintain that there ought to be a way that nodes like this (that don't relay txs and blocks) ought to advertise themselves as such upon connection so that other nodes can make an informed decision on deciding whether to connect to other nodes or not that are relaying. Without this advertising, nodes can only guess based upon frequency of txs and blocks received from such nodes.",

The bandwidth per connection can continue to be monitored, and connections changed as and when needed. This is already something I've been coding in my parallelblocksdownload branch, and allows it to choose how many nodes to download from based upon the bandwidth it knows is available.

(you think of it as stealing, think about it)\r\n\r\nAll this is nice and such, but the client is still interfering with your download speed.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the original poster's : \r\n\"I noticed the other day Bitcoin was maxing out my upload bandwidth on ADSL. Probably due to sending the block chain to fellow bitcoin users ( I had about 65 connections at the time )..\"\r\n\r\nThe real answer has already been given by \"luke-jr\" who posted:\r\n\"QoS is really a router job, but I guess reliable routers aren't too common :/\"\r\n\r\nCynics never seem to want to give a straigh answer :/\r\n\r\nHe meant to say, probably, that one should better complain about routers not adhering to or even implementing traffic shaping standards. Just checking a box and clicking apply doesn't necessarily mean it happens, not even on /open/ hard- or software. Bugs anyone? \r\nAlthough in the latter case they have a higher chance of being found and fixed.\r\n\r\n(somewhat poetic methinks: bitcoins changing the world by people complaining to the networkmakers their bitcoins aren't going through fast enough)\r\n\r\nThis works on the premise that bitcoin-qt client adheres to QoS standards.\r\nWhich was the original posters' client. (I mistook him for a troll at first)\r\n\r\nWhich it seems to do for a long time.\r\nEven though traffic has recently increased, my router at least, graciously, lets me see my \"ted talk\" full speed. Throttling bitcoin traffic? Yes! But according to the QoS bit, ie. my bandwidth is mine.\r\n\r\nIn stead of pointing out to the developers that for some reason or other his bitcointraffic had increased (an act in vein I suppose, they already know, or he failed to check) and supplying them with at the very least operating system details and client version used...  Nooooo ....\r\n\r\nThe immediate functionality proffered: throttling, choking. How human.\r\n\r\nThis \"solution\" has already been applied to bittorrent clients.\r\nutorrent (to name one) implemented it's own traffic shaper.\r\nInstead of complaining to the router makers.\r\n\r\nIf there are no, or only few seeders for this \"ted talk\" you just wished to see right now (or within certain limits therof), no \"ted talk\" for you right now (or within certain limits therof). Or maybe never, the seed is dead.\r\n\r\nNow be honest, what's /your/ overall share ratio, did you cap the upload? Do you still seed the \"ted talk\"?\r\nDo you cycle ports? Accept only encrypted connections, so your provider can't sniff bittorent protocol, to keep bandwidth up? Have used TOR? (although, that's ridiculous: torrents over tor)\r\n\r\nThat's the consequence.\r\nBittorrent, how beautiful it is, is crippled just because of that. Not because it's censored.\r\n(I'm in Holland and cannot access piratebay.com, but DHT seems to work very well though, but I do get a lot of fake \"ted talks\".)\r\n\r\nEvery bitcoin is retraceable, up to the first 50 (just look up block 0) and every other bitcoin after that. (if you've got the time; computers have)\r\nThere're no copy- or other rights on the protocol or the numbers that are sent.\r\nFurthermore BTC traffic may not, cannot be capped or blocked. It's legal, or, not illegal.\r\n\r\nI cannot but admire the stanza of the btc-core devs by going all Douglas Adams-y: \"It is somebody else's problem\".\r\n\r\nOk, and now for the real issue:\r\nNobody has /obliged/ you to keep the client running!\r\nHogs your bandwidth? Stop it! But expect a delay to check recent transactions though, so you know where your coins are coming from, and can thus trust them.\r\n\r\nYou don't walk alround with your wallet open all day do you?

I want everybody running the client, even more, i want everything running the client!\r\nI want to be able to pay with bitcoins, and want immedate confirmation of my payments.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you're the client, I want you to confirm my transaction, as if you were there. What is so difficult about that?\r\n\r\nSeeing the rise of bitcoin, al lot of people seem to want that too. So why are you postponing or even denying (--nolisten) that?\r\n\r\nYou ask:\r\n\"So is it better to have fast and slower servers, or only fast?\r\n\r\nAnd I have repeatedly explained there is no difference, you don''t seem to grab the concept.\r\n\r\nSometimes you get congestion, when there a lot of transactions going on.\r\nWhy are the roads only congested between 9 and 5 (well I can only speak for holland of course)\r\nThe usual solution is bigger roads, but that doesn't work, they fill up too.\r\nOver here the solution is choking the inlet of vehicles, but that only displaces the problem to the inlets.\r\nSo now the congestion is in the villages (Where it shouldn't be, children and all that). And it takes forever to get on the freeway ... to use an american colloquialism \"You know what I mean?\")\r\n\r\nI'm sure you've noticed the absurd rise in bitcoin value?\r\n\r\nThere are only about 21.000.000 bitcoins\r\n\r\nThe issue of bandwidth resolves itself. after 2020 it's only mining for lost wallets.\r\n\r\nNo, the real fight is the size of the blocks....\r\n\r\nIf you still don't understand me, than explain to me why you want your wallet online 24/24 without paying for it.\r\n\r\nBut take this in mind.\r\n\r\nBitcoins cost money, have you ever traded a bitcoin?\r\n",

I understand p2p tends to do that, specially as more people \"needs\" the information from the network... but this also happens when you have *less* people in the network (because there are fewer places to download from).  I have a monthly bw quota on the machine where I'm running bitcoind.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, the more nodes, the more reliable this network is (or the less likely is that some individual or institution can take-over bitcoin network by controlling the majority of nodes), I can add QoS to limit bitcoind (and I will, you bet I will), however, the average user just don't know how to do that.  Adding a simple setting that limits bitcoind bw usage will just encourage people to run the client.... for now, the daemon goes down until I get the time to configure QoS, however, if it had a simpler way to throttle it *now*, it would continue to run, 24/7.\r\n\r\nI'm not very interested in coins at all (I first heard about this project several years ago), I just found the idea to be interesting, and assumed that adding more \"honest\" nodes to the network would be good.... apparently you don't really care about that, you just want \"a few fast nodes\" instead of *many* not-so-fast nodes.  I think that \"the more the best\" for this kind of system... but maybe I'm wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "@soulhunter There seems to be a bit of confusion here.\r\n\r\nOf course we need many nodes if we want a decentralized system. But we mainly want many nodes that validate - Bitcoin's primary advantage over other currencies (in my opinion) is that I don't need to trust anyone to know nobody is cheating. If it's easier to run such a node, the less people will have not to do so.\r\n\r\nHowever, to bootstrap a new node, it needs to be shown the history of the current state, so it can independently also assess that nothing in the past was fraudulent. Thus, we need a way of feeding them this history, and it's provided by other nodes in the network that also at some had to download that history anyway. Ideally, we also have as many of these as possible. But reality is not perfect. Not everyone wants to sacrifice their upstream for doing this, while others have plenty of upstream to spare. And, with the current buggy implementation, if you're accidentally hitting a slow peer to download from, you'll have a slow download. We don't have a mechanism to search for good peers or parallellize the download. Thus, as long as the sync mechanism is not improved, yes everyone is better off with few faster uploaders than many slower ones. Note that this is just about serving historic blocks to others - you can perfectly validate all blocks and transactions, and participate otherwise in the network without providing that service.",

I'm guessing that bloating the client by linking to libtransmission or its ilk is not acceptable (or would it be?). It might not be secure either. It probably does solve several problems associated with bandwidth and data cap management. \r\n\r\nPerhaps as an independent experiment someone (I?) should try implementing a patch to respond only to historical data requests beyond a certain date or block number. I'm guessing most peers are either totally out of date (requiring the entire history) or else only a week or two out of date. I'm absolutely making this up, so I could be grossly wrong, but it seems like a reasonable guess. Assuming this is true, most peers could be served by setting a date filter a couple weeks in the past, and require brand new peers to resort to Jeff Garzik's torrent or whatever other mechanism might be available. It's not helpful to new clients, but it might easy bandwidth use.",

Not running a Bitcoin node seems to be the alternative the developers prefer and I'm fine with not doing that.\r\n\r\nConsider this: You have a fiber and ADSL and you run tor, i2p, a bittorrent client and perhaps some other stuff. All these things - basically all SANE P2P software - let you set an upload bandwidth limit so you can browse the web and do other things with your connection normally. Then you have bitcoind which basically tries to use 100% of your connection and makes everything else crawl to a halt. Most people will simply see bitcoind as something that lacks the most basic features all other P2P software has (ability to set port port, limit number of connections, bandwidth etc) and not run it.\r\n\r\nI see this bug is 3 years old. I'll check back in 3 years to see if the devs arguing against bandwidth limiting have figured out that having a lot of nodes with a bandwidth limit is better than having only a few high-bandwidth nodes with dedicated connections by then. I'm guessing they won't but one can hope.",

FWIW, (and I don't know if you actually care about the technology or are just here to gripe) no one was at all opposed to having a limit. There were changes needed as prerequisites to having a limit and they are now almost done (headers first has had some preparatory changes in 0.9 and should be finished in the next version).  If you're having problems with the usage immediately you can set listen=0 in bitcoin.conf and shunt 95% of the bursty outbound traffic immediately with no adverse impact on the network, this is the recommendation for a short term workaroundÃ¢ÂÂ not failing to run a node.

What I said still holds up though: even distributing blocks as they go across the network is a lot of data.\r\n\r\nLooking at blockchain.info right now, 20 minutes ago there was a block of 0.9MB. Times 7 (one peer must already have it) makes a 6MB upload. On my previous connection that'd cause just over 1 minute of no internet.\r\n\r\nGoing over these numbers it's pretty clear that running a full bitcoin node on such a connection is just not going to help anyone. But I don't need to be a full node, I just want to run the official (or perhaps I should say \"generally leading\") bitcoin client with my own block chain. Having a switch for not uploading blocks and/or not uploading transactions would be helpful. This is said to cause DoS issues, but I'd say that's a problem in this client and not a network issue: anyone can setup and advertise a lot of rogue nodes that never do anything. Non-listening nodes should disconnect peers that seem to be only leeching because they might be trying to slow down or disturb the network.",

Even with a bandwidth limit on B (like 100 Mbps), it's better to sync from B than A!\r\nAlso wouldn't it be better for a node to limit its upload to 90% of it in order to avoid saturation ? (ack packets etc.). Maybe node A would run better with a 900 Kbps throtle (and other user would be abble to surf the web) ?\r\n\r\nLast, having this kind of seeting would be a way to \"announce\" your node speed to other and let them decide to sync (or not) from you.",

A key issue is that in the process of a full node being fully unrestricted, there are a few different calls which are made by the client and its peers to the system or the bitcoin network, any one of or series of which could be causing a performance decrease, stall or crash in an almost endless variety of ways on the host machine.\r\n\r\nShould a generally unobtrusive and intuitive solution to this issue be found. it would be nice if a) this issue were closed (for the benefit of the denser of us laymen who can't read between the lines), and b) that solution were regularly cited for the relieving sake of those of us who would genuinely and enthusiastically appreciate being able to spend more time building or creating, versus dwindling, searching, or defending (albeit poor) attempts to draw attention to a long-lingering, impacting issue.\r\n\r\nAnd should there be strong reason to maintain this feature as \"necessary\", such as sound arguments about bitcoin integrity or security, then it would benefit us to have those reasons regularly cited, posted, or linked, and for this issue to be closed.",

      "body" : "This issue was created in 2011, when global average internet speeds according to [Akamai](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2012/04/akamai-study-finds-uk-average-broadband-speeds-fell-to-4-9mbps-in-2011.html) were 2.3MBit/s.\r\n\r\nSince then global average speeds have increased substantially (according to[ M-Lab and cable.co.uk](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2022/09/uk-jumps-to-35th-out-of-224-countries-for-broadband-speed-in-2022.html)) to 34.79MBit/s with many countries having well over 100MBit/s or even 1000MBit/s available to consumers, in conjunction with proliferation of 4 and 5G high speed wireless networks with equivalent speeds.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Bitcoin blockchain has grown from 0.19GB to the current (Oct 2022) ~450GB which puts more strain on network nodes during the IBD phase, something that cannot really be sidestepped in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nTechnologies such as compact blocks (BIP152) have been introduced which, for tx-relaying nodes, the authors [claim](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki#protocol-design) can relay blocks 90% of the time without having to request any missing transactions, sharply reducing the bandwidth spikes reported above which used to occur during moments of new block relay. Note that if  user has configured their node to run in `-blocksonly` mode (to reduce total bandwith by something in the order of ~80% by disablilng transaction relay) they will not be able to benefit from compact blocks bandwidth peak reduction during block relay, as they have no mempool to reconstruct the block from.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this [Erlay](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515) is edging towards completion and also claims to reduce bandwidth significantly, although it's currently unclear if it will meet it's initial claim of 40%. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/7).\r\n\r\nIt is made clear in the comments above that bandwidth limitations on nodes serving historical blocks (listening nodes) is not desirable for the health of the network as a whole, regardless of whether this node wants to feel altruistic by \"giving something back to the network\".\r\n\r\nTherefore I conclude that, unless there is a clear proposal here detailing exactly how bandwidth should be further limited in Bitcoin Core, we should finally close this issue. Because in addition to having on average significantly more bandwidth available today, nodes have the following options available to them to configure depending on their specific circumstances:\r\n\r\n| Measure | Notes |  Reduce total | Limit block spikes\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Compact blocks (enabled) | block tx set reconcilliation from mempool | âï¸ | âï¸ |\r\n|  `maxuploadtarget` | limit total upload bandwith per 24h | âï¸ | â |\r\n| `-listen=0` | no incoming connections | âï¸ | â |\r\n| `-blocksonly=1` |  total bandwith reduction of ~80% | âï¸ | â |\r\n| Reduce `maxconnections=` | go lower than the default of 10 + 2 outbound peers | âï¸ | â |\r\n| Software bandwidth monitor | e.g. Trickle, per process or interface | âï¸ | âï¸ |\r\n| Router bandwidth monitor | affests all host traffic  | âï¸ | âï¸ |\r\n| (Future) Erlay | reduces duplicate relay | âï¸ | â |\r\n\r\nWhilst not _all_ the options are compatible with each other, I believe that there is a working combination here for most operators.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it there will remain one case which cannot be covered by Bitcoin Core program options alone (i.e. without using software of router bandwidth monitors), which is limiting peak rate during IBD. Bitcoin Core will still see your node use up it's `maxuploadtarget` quota as soon as it can, before limiting itself.",
