Basically, importing using this format would be exactly the same as the existing (51-character) string, but a 22-character mini private key could be provided instead.  This would probably fit right here as a different SetSecret that took the string, and ought to take no more than a dozen lines of code.  These codes are being used today in Casascius physical bitcoins.  The 22-character code need not be persisted in any way - it ought to simply be converted to a normal instance of CBitcoinSecret immediately upon entry, so, these would be displayed in the normal 51-character format if they were exported or dumped.\r\n\r\nThe mini private key is simple.  The Bitcoin private key is computed as the SHA256 hash of the given string.  No more, no less.  A shorter private key is universally desirable both in QR codes and in situations where the private key must be manually typed.\r\n\r\nThe mini private key format offers a simple well-formedness check and also a hash-based check for typo detection, which is designed to be briefly computationally intensive (requires multiple rounds of SHA256) so as to not detract from the limited entropy that can fit in 22 characters in a brute-force attack scenario.  It is described in the Wiki article.  Only 22-character strings that meet the well-formedness and typo check criteria should need to be considered for evaluation as importable private keys.",

The QR codes are generated from scratch, client-side, as well.  This is exactly how a personal address generator should be.  One can save the single .html file to disk and use it to safely generate bitcoin addresses straight to their printer while disconnected from the internet.  To me, it's a shining example of a good idea rather than an exploit.",

Realistically though this isn't our problem any more than any other product or service whose userbase is regularly phished. We can put the info out there, but people want this feature and if it's not in the main client it'll be in external tools like pywallet. We can't stop those who want to from importing addresses, merging wallets, etc. The best we can do is put up big scary popups in the GUI implementation informing folks that messing with the wallet is dangerous and if they do stupid things they'll get bad results.",

You have to know why you're there and what the number means, otherwise it is just a gibberish generator.  And the part I appreciate the most is simply that he has released functional code that can be clipped and put into other environments where the source is ostensibly trusted. (e.g. on MtGox, or on the LinuxCoin ISO).  Free bonus is it's platform independent.\r\n\r\nI think the best thing that can be done to the GUI implementation would be to include this functionality where the user can get at it, and seek to be less user unfriendly, then websites like this wouldn't have a reason to exist.",

I want this in the main client badly because I use it all the time and believe that keys on paper will help solve the black eye Bitcoin has received over security incidents, but it occurs to me that there is no way that this would be taken seriously as acceptable in the main client if it needs to pause for 90+ seconds (and growing) to perform an import.  The client itself needs badly to maintain an index for the purpose of doing that rescanning (if it doesn't do so already), among other useful purposes I can think of.",

That said, the mini private key format sounds useful. What do other people think about supporting this format?\n\nSecond, importprivkey is the wrong place to implement it, as CBitcoinSecrets are used in other places as well that could benefit from supporting it. I think either inside the constructor of CBitcoinSecret, or as a separate utility function that does the conversion.",

      "body" : "With respect to the massive database of addresses... I could see myself trying to implement that down the road as my familiarity with the code gets better, but possibly in the form of a patch or an option that is turned off by most people because it's only useful to a specific audience: server operators.\r\n\r\nThe specific real-world everyday application it would support would be so that websites (e.g. MtGox, or marketplaces that accept bitcoin deposits) could accept a \"deposit by typed private key\", and the private key wouldn't necessarily be imported, but rather, bitcoind would do one of two things:\r\n\r\neither, one - immediately create and broadcast a one-off transaction (without adding the key to the wallet like importprivkey does) that sent the entire balance at that address to a specific one given as a parameter, at which point it would be treated like a deposit that came in externally (with the option of sending only a specific amount, the rest, if any, going back to the original address or to an optionally provided but specific \"change\" address)... \r\n\r\n- or - two, offer an RPC query feature that simply coughed up all of the unspent transactions associated with a given address, so that some sort of RPC client could implement the creation of that transaction (a feature I believe is useful in itself for other purposes that also wouldn't apply to everybody)\r\n\r\nSuch a feature would depend on the ability to quickly find all transactions (standard ones, at least) given an address, and would promote the usability of paper bitcoin wallets and physical bearer items, which in turn is a viable way for joe schmoe and/or Grandpa to _securely_ manage his bitcoins without needing to learn about wallet encryption and keyloggers.  If bitcoind is tied up for a minute and a half to import an address, this will be impossible in a MtGox-like server scenario.",

(Sorry, C++ semantics rusty for me, otherwise that's something that should otherwise be clear).\n\nMy intent is to just make sure that the CBitcoinSecret has a SetString override that can handle either kind of key.  (I believe the base class already has a SetString).  I can do it in the constructor, but as far as I can tell, that will require a new member (a flag) or an exception thrown back to report back to the caller whether the string was any good.  Suggest to me which you'd prefer, and I will do it that way and test it.",

      "body" : "I'm not super-keen on the reduction in collision resistance compared to 160-bit addresses (keep in mind, general any-any \"birthday paradox\" collision is sqrt(brute force), so only 61.5 bitsÃ¢ÂÂ but it's actually lower than that, the \"CRC\" check reduces the keyspace by another 16 bitsÃ¢ÂÂ so only 53.5 bits of collision resistance.\r\n\r\nIf these are widely used the chances of two people accidental ending up with the same key is not so astronomically low that we could wave away critics who complain that this is a flaw in bitcoin.\r\n\r\n717 cycles of the hash is _worthless_ as strengthening, I'm guessing this was some number picked by someone with a horribly slow interpreted implementation of SHA256??    Figure a random desktop CPU can do on the order of 1M/sha256/s/core, conservatively. If the count isn't going to be increased to a reasonable number (e.g. >100k), then it really should just be set to 1: simpler and doesn't give a false impression of security.    Even 100k cycles would still result in technically usable key generation times (e.g. 12.7s worst case assuming 1Mh/s), but if that is too slow the validity check could be reduced to  the 10,000 cycle point (max ~1 sec generation) then another million cycles (1 second import) could be applied before you can get the public key (and thus _address_) from a valid candidate key.\r\n\r\nI'm doubly concerned with the computational complexity here due to the fact that our own project has helped lower the cost per sha256 operation so much. :) The same cautions I made about using a hash function we've made so fast for the wallet crypto apply here but double so because we can't change this.\r\n\r\nAlso, the way the stretch is designed every intermediate step is has no feedback of the initial material. This means that internal collisions in the hash will reduce the space further. A proper PBKDF algorithm should be used.\r\n",

      "body" : "First, let me comment on the \"birthday paradox\" argument.  I believe this is a good argument that has been misapplied.  If this were a hashing algorithm that had 21^58 possible outputs for 21^58 possible inputs, then it would definitely apply.  But we are using SHA256.  We are mapping 21^58 possible inputs into a keyspace of 2^256 outputs.  To suggest that SHA256 will only give 2^61.5 unique outputs given 21^58 possible inputs is to suggest that SHA256 is a pretty poor hashing algorithm.\r\n\r\nLet me put it another way.  If I decided that mini private keys had only 1 character (so, 58 possible keys going into SHA256), the same birthday paradox argument applied in the same way would suggest that SHA256 would only give sqrt(58), or about seven, possible unique outputs given these 58 inputs, and that the other 51 of them would be SHA256 collisions with one another.  It goes without saying that's not the case.\r\n\r\nNext, let's review the process of one iteration of trying to brute force one of these keys.  This isn't hash cracking, because we don't even have the target hash value.  That's because the hash value IS the asset - not the plaintext used to arrive at it, as would be the case in password cracking.\r\n\r\nTo try one iteration (set the CRC aside), one would have to do the SHA256, and then convert that to a Bitcoin address, and then check that against the set of all Bitcoin addresses known to have funds.  The most expensive part of this process by far is the \"convert to Bitcoin address\" step, which involves an elliptic curve multiplication.  In fact, that step is so expensive as to render the SHA256 part nearly moot, whether it's once or 717 times.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I chose the number 717, with an option for 1 round, is specifically to keep it feasible to GENERATE these keys within slow interpreted languages like Javascript.  To actually generate these keys requires a brute force SHA256 effort to find one with eight zero bits.  If something like 100,000 rounds were required, the minimum expense to generate these keys would be high.\r\n\r\nI looked at it this way.  To generate a mini key that passes the check after 1 round, that requires on average 256 SHA256 operations.  To generate a mini key that passes the check after 717 rounds, that requires on average over 180,000 rounds (717*256).  At some point, it almost becomes less expensive to do the EC multiply to see if the key has funds versus eliminating it through the CRC, and doing more rounds of SHA256 isn't going to serve any useful purpose.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure 58^21/2^16 is the right math... as the CRC check is \"either or\".  The check passes with zeroes on the first round, OR zeroes on the 717th round, so about 1 in 128 random strings will pass the check.  The math is probably better expressed as 58^21 / 2^7 in the worst case.\r\n\r\nFinally, these are being used for physical bitcoins worth 1 BTC.  That's the payoff for going to the effort of cracking one.  The application this would be likely adopted for by others would be to help small payments move around from hand-to-hand, face to face, since these are the applications where space is at a premium.  By no means am I recommending that someone use a 22-character code for their life savings.  The low entropy is no secret, I mentioned it myself in the wiki article.  I penciled in a 26-character version for applications where 22 characters (what I felt was the bare minimum) wasn't going to cut it.  If we turned on a 30 character version, we'd probably have a keyspace that exceeded the 160 bits present in a Bitcoin address to begin with, though I didn't do it because I didn't consider it necessary.  It's a trivial change if consensus says otherwise.\r\n",

You make a very good point, in that with such a scheme, a smaller QR code becomes possible without any question as to whether a reduction is lessening security.\r\n\r\nMy physical bitcoins aside, I believe a short-to-type private key format is highly valuable and important to Bitcoin's future.  I foresee Joe Sixpack buying bitcoins for cash at a pawn shop or check cashing place, and him receiving them in the form of a pre-made scratch-off card that gets activated (read: loaded) at the register.  Which he will then take to the Bitcoin-accepting online marketplace of his choice, and type it in for instant credit.  He may or may not be able to scan a QR code, and this Joe won't be downloading clients or block chains.  Typing 50+ mixed-case characters really sucks (done it numerous times), but especially for Joe.  Even 22 sucks, but that's already flirting with the minimum enough and there is not much that can be done about that.",

(of course, you'll still also need  1x sha256+ripemd160 to get an address)\r\n\r\nI think you've missed the point on the birthday paradox issue: I'm not proposing that this somehow makes it easier to find the private key from the address or anything like that. There are N=58^21 possible keys (minus the ones lost to checking), there are M being used.  These are the only figures you need to know to figure out the probability of two identical keys coming into existence by chance. When M=sqrt(N) it's 50%.  The interior operations are as irrelevant as the 86400 seconds in a day are to the traditional birthday paradox example. :)\r\n\r\nFor your use this level of security may be adequate.  But if this is put in the software it will be used for other things, and I don't believe it is adequate for very many things. (If you'd reached 2^160 I'd have nothing to complain about).\r\n\r\nI don't follow why you did the either/or check (I'd correctly used the 7 bit number initially, but sipa corrected me on IRC doh, not that I'm also not guilty of misreading the code).  Why isn't this sha256^n(key)[0]&127==0 ?  The early check reduces the security of the strengthening (and makes analysis harder) without providing a substantial speedup.\r\n\r\nGenerating these keys in javascript is a bad idea. The current browsers JS does not provide an appropriate environment for security-important operations.

      "body" : "@sipa:  If you calculated half of all the minikeys and ignored all the ones that needed 717 rounds to generate, you'd only victimize those who elected to use the ones that passed on the first round.  Those who follow the best practice of only using only the ones that pass on round 717, and not on round 1, where able, are not going to be affected.  On the other hand, if you're a javascript and you need to quickly generate an address to collect a payment that's going to get swept to another wallet right away anyway, the option for a 1 round key comes in handy.\r\n\r\nSupporting the import of these private keys in the client doesn't in and of itself encourage their unnecessary use.  The average joe user isn't going to be making the decision as to which kind of key to use, these decisions are presumably going to be made by developers who would have the intellectual means to weigh whether generating minikeys versus full keys in their app is a good design decision.  I think it would be irresponsible to put a \"generate minikey\" button in the client.  But I don't think it serves any useful purpose to not accept them as imports and instead demand the user use some other utility to get the job he already needs done, done.  (Having him find and download the other utility exposes him to a new class of risks by itself, far more frightening than a brute force attack on the key space).",

      "body" : "@gmaxwell: I used the \"either or\" check so that there would be a means to generate a crappy key if you only need it for a short time for a crappy purpose.  In other words, if you have the means to select a key that passes the 717 check and not the 1st check, then by all means do that.  That means, to generate a \"better\" key, explicitly discard all the candidates that pass on the 1st check.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that javascript is a poor environment to be generating keys, and I mention it only for ease of illustration.  Minikeys could be needed in the context of an interpreted language on a server, or on a microcontroller.  Imagine a check cashing shop that sells BTC and uses a VeriFone point-of-sale credit card machine to generate and issue a minicode on a piece of receipt tape - a very plausible application.  That little box with its 400 MHz underclocked ARM and 2MB memory might not be able to do 180000 SHA256's in any short order, and 95% says the dude buying it is probably going to redeem it that same day, so the window of opportunity for a thief is vanishingly short.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let's kick around as granted the conclusion that this is a bad idea.  What do we want Joe Sixpack to do instead when he acquires a private key given to him on paper?  We could make him type 51 characters instead of 22, sure.  We could make him type 26 or 30 as well.  We could make him scan a QR code, but it's likely he either has nothing to scan it with, or is almost certainly going to have to hand-key it off his cell phone and into his computer, making the QR code of no benefit and nothing more than an extra burdensome step.  I suppose it's fair to say that a minimum length keycode is universally desirable, and it's really just where to draw the line of being reckless with security.\r\n\r\nLet me also propose an alternate solution.  The key space for my proposal is all of those who pass the SHA256 check with the magic byte \"00\".  What if, in addition to this, we define another key space, and that's all of those 22-character base58 codes who fail my check but pass with magic byte \"01\".  And then we utilize a far more computationally intensive key derivation function to compute the 32-bytes in place of SHA256, that dwarfs both SHA256 and EC in resource complexity, and define that as the best practice for generating such short keycodes.  And then still leave 717 and even 1-round SHA256 as a weak option so that microcontrollers can still stay in the game where needed.\r\n",
