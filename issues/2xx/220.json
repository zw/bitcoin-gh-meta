It is\na 51-character base58-encoded string, that includes a version number\nand a checksum.\n\nThe wallet format is JSON-based, and includes:\n- addresses (informational, optional)\n- private keys\n- amounts per balance (informational, optional)\n- blocks where addresses were first used (optional)\n- ids of transactions in which addresses were credited (optional)\n- labels (optional)\n\nIt specifically does not contain:\n- sender address book\n- settings\n- account information\n- unconfirmed wallet transactions\n\nNote that playing around with import/export and moving addresses around between wallets may result in double-spends, which may result in corrupted wallets. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/195 for a solution\n",
