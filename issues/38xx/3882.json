   "body" : "Recent events made me realize that we really need to do this. Binding development of the core network infrastructure to development of a wallet gives people the wrong impression. \n\nAlso it gets us all kinds of end user concerns and bike-shedding in this project, which distracts from core infrastructure work.\n\nWhat concretely needs to be done here? At least\n1. Factor out parts needed by both the bitcoind and the wallet into a library (basically the current libbitcoin_common + libbitcoin_server).\n   - Install .h files and .a/.so files in a way that they can be used by another project\n   - Create a new project on github for this library? Or just build it as part of this repository for now?\n2. Create a new project on github under bitcoin, `bitcoin-core-wallet`, move the wallet specific parts to here (libbitcoin_wallet,  wallet specific tests, wallet GUI code). This project uses the aforementioned library.\n3. The wallet should be able to work as SPV client, at least with a trusted bitcoind instance. Headers-first is a move in this direction.\n4. Wallet GUI should be changed to be able to launch a bitcoind process in the background (an option which defaults to on) and stop it when shutting down. This keeps the user experience consistent.\n5. Gitian build / release process should build and ship both projects.\n\nSome of these steps can be done independently of each other.\n\nAnything I forgot? Please keep discussion to concrete development.\n",
