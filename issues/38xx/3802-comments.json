If I want my two local nodes to communicate I either have to forge every connection manually with `-connect` (external ones, and internal LAN ones) or just hope that the `-addnode` actually works. Ideally addnode would whitelist/add priority to the connection but it doesn't seem to, often the node will just ignore them and connect to random external peers. ",

You would still want your own copy (and verify it) but you don't want too much load on the works network connection (multiple people downloading the blockchain). In the end it would be good to have local nodes prioritize each other (while checking with the external network to make sure a malicious LAN node couldn't feed you off main chain blocks).\r\n\r\nEDIT: I'm working on a Python multicast test to show you all.",

The trustednode/connect idea and the idea of manually ensuring that different wallets on different PCs share the same blockchain data is possible (see @rebroad).

With a auto discovery feature some of this will automatically happen (though the blockchain data will be stored on each pc).\r\n\r\nThe problem with going ahead with this is because the blockchain download only uses one peer at a time so along with discovery we'd need a change to make sure that it either prefers local nodes for the download or a change to ensure that it downloads from multiple nodes at once as @darkhosis pointed out.",
