Additionally, it is unlikely for a long time that the version of libc in stable or testing replaces the unstable version and so your only potential of getting any critical fixes, such as security related fixes, vanishes as soon as you remove the sid repo line.\r\n\r\nPlease *do not* use this recommendation or pass this along.  The sheer issues with apt related to libc versions, breaking existing packages, security, etc. make this solution a poor idea.\r\n\r\nInstead for now you have two options that are *much* better:\r\n1) Use the static binaries from 0.9.1 (bitcoin-cli.static and bitcoind.static)\r\n2) build your own, which amusingly enough requires an old version of db4.8 from squeeze (currently oldstable)",
