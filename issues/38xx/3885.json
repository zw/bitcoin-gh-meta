They should be completely noninvasive to current builds, but some verification would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe dependencies are here for now: https://github.com/theuni/osx-cross-depends\r\n\r\nWhile this may not be immediately useful for 0.9.0, it would be nice to have the final release build-able this way, so that we can compare apples/apples when discussing its use in the future.",
