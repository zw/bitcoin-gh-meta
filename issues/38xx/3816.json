Rather than fix it, the consensus seems to lean towards scrapping the accounting system entirely, and returning to a system where keys may have labels (or tags, as I prefer to call them).\r\n\r\nThe accounting system can easily result in negative or odd balances if misused or misunderstood, which has happened in the field.  Use of raw tx API or direct spends exacerbates this.  Users are used to seemingly-odd practices of transferring imaginary money from a dummy account, to eliminate a negative number in some cases.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, this seems likely to be a large, incompatible change to RPC.  This implies\r\n* other incompatible RPC changes are possible\r\n* the following line in rpcserver.cpp should be updated along standard REST API versioning conventions, changing the standard URI path from \"/\" to \"/v2/\" or somesuch.\r\n````\r\n        if (strURI != \"/\") {\r\n````\r\n\r\n",
