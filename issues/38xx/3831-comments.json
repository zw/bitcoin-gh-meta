      "body" : "bitcoin 0.8.6 showed addresses you own the private key in the receive tab, else in the address tab.\r\nThe problem here is that we insert the address in the addressbook first and then import the private key after that. This results in the temporary bug you described. The address is shown in address tab until a refresh is triggered, then it switches to receive tab.\r\n\r\nThe bug will (probably) be fixed in bitcoin 0.9, because we explicitly assign a \"receive\" purpose to each imported key.\r\n\r\n@backlof Would you mind testing this with 0.9rc2 and then close this issue, if fixed. I highly assume the problem to be fixed there. Please use this version ONLY in testing environment.\r\n\r\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/test/",
