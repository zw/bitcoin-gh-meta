      "body" : "Much lurking lately since nothing to add, but I personally would love to decouple the base network from everything else. --disable-wallet was an important step.Building out bitcoind so that it offers better scalability is probably the next most important thing I believe we need. \r\n\r\nThis means that any accounting or additional functionality will have to be modular and separate anyway since its going to have to deal with potentially a new architecture that makes this possible. \r\n\r\nIF you guys have the time to make that happen so be it. Most of the guys that are doing any of this stuff commercially SHOULD be building out their own transaction \"management\" mechanisms since its their money and they should have appropriate architecture, code and processes in place to mitigate losses for themselves and their customers. IF they don't have the skills to do it .. too bad, no money for Timmy. \r\n\r\nFundamentally: The bullshit we saw recently with our dear friend mark can not be repeated again - giving \"people\" all the OPEN code, the fruit of YOUR loins, so they can take it out there and make Bitcoin look bad is really not cool. IMHO YMMV ..etc.. \r\n\r\nEDIT : someone left their soapbox behind .. I will step off it now. There you go .. you can have it back .. ;) ",

Some of the biggest sites - coinbase and mtgox - have both tried the best to re-implement transactions and network behavior, but both seem to have had extraordinary trouble managing to keep up with smaller nuances. Coinbase seems to have some strange issues with their software keeping up with the blockchain and sending proper transactions, mtgox has had issues sending transactions (invalid DER encoding) and managing to automatically resend unconfirmed transactions without double spending the inputs. \r\n\r\nIf some incredibly well funded ventures have trouble scaling bitcoin transactions, what chance does the self-funded startup or small company have? `bitcoind` is inadequate for almost any situation larger than a couple of issues, which leaves users reaching for blockchain.info, who have been dispensing completely incorrect (missing transactions, bad spent/unspent information, invalid balancea)  information for at least a week now. \r\n\r\nIf we want to avoid centralization the available solutions need to be improved, removing the awful `accounts` feature is hopefully a catalyst.

      "body" : "@jgarzik @laanwj What's the status of this? I have been working on this topic. It would be good if the accounts feature would be indeed flagged as deprecated (see laanjw's proposal to change to labels [1]). I know of plenty merchants, exchanges, etc. who (mis-) use the account system. It will be very helpful to have a much better documented RPC, so that people who implement account features can build together in the open, instead of closed source. Quite a few people use bitcoind only through the RPC without knowing internals. I'm implementing an account system which is layered over bitcoind, not using the internal account system. As I understand that's what most larger operations do.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3664#issuecomment-35386000\r\n",

The point of an API is to expose functionality which is not concerned with internals. To write a web-application I don't need to know TCP/IP or ethernet (or the physics of fibre optic cables).",

I wouldn't mind implementing it myself, but the\r\n> fact that bitcoind already offered this functionality seemed like a no\r\n> brainer. It sounded like a robust accounting solution, but apparently not.\r\n> Is there any other open source library you guys would recommend for this or\r\n> should I roll my own? Preferably ruby.\r\n> Thanks!\r\n>\r\n> Ã¢ÂÂ\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3816#issuecomment-68338212>.\r\n>\r\n",

      "body" : "An open source project is supposed to be based on mutual interest, but that implies that all the parties are contributing. Bitcoin Core has always been an extremely lopsided project, in that almost none of the companies using it contribute anything back. It is not 'us versus you'. Here on github it should just be 'us contributors'.\r\n\r\nAlso the account system is not broken, it does what it does. That's exactly who no one dares to change it anymore. Legacy code and all that. I heard some people are going to work on a new wallet on a separate branch, so if the design is done right this time, it will include the appropriate hooks for building an account system on top.\r\n\r\nLots of aspects are confused in one project right now, this should unravel or it is going to cause problems for certain. You cannot have a few overworked devs maintain the entire ecosystem. It is important for us to be able to focus on the core infrastructure as there are many challenges ahead there. First and foremost the network should keep running and scaling.\r\n\r\nPeople *should* be able to say, fork the wallet code and account code without forking the consensus code as well. Right now that is kind of unwieldy with everything in one project. For the steps toward splitting things up, some migration is going to be necessary, and sometimes that's going to come with the pain of APIs being deprecated.\r\n\r\nThat said, yes the deprecation needs to be better documented. We could add a warning to the 0.10 release notes.",

      "body" : "<question/diatribe directed to @jgarzikf> \r\n\r\nJeff, with all due respect, this is/has been the position that has been held for as long as I have been involved, which by now, is not an insubstantial amount of time. ( thanks mainly to our friends at BFL ;) ) \r\n\r\nHow can this be a brainstorming session if everyone that matters (the devs) are defending the status quo? and frankly, in my opinion directly attacking any position that attempts to move it in any meaningful direction. Despite the length and time I took to write this, this thread is not my whole being, but it does represent something I dearly love and care about, perhaps too much. I am sincerely extremely saddened by the ABSOLUTE immovability of this general situation. (The wallet falls into the same category). This brainstorming session just sounds like an extremely small loud echo chamber to me. i.e.. the seats are reserved, doors locked and guarded and the invitations into the discussion are actively censored and filtered,or simply dismissed by discrediting the voices of descent. Reminds me of the Free Masons. Lol. \r\n</question/diatribe directed to @jgarzikf> \r\n\r\n<my bitcoin philosophy>\r\nA project that at one point had well over USD 1 Billion  invested. I know it had moments of far greater  glory, but lets stick to a reasonably conservative number for shits and giggle - what the REAL value is, can be left for another debate, but the bottomline: it can not continue to be run like this considering the amount of loot involved. \r\n\r\nIf Satoshi was still around, he could fill the vacuum of \"the voice of reason\" .. very much like what Linus does. We do not have this luxury, unfortunately. The keys to the kingdom, and ultimately the responsibility for that ~$1B were handed over to \"you guys\" .. the devs... the guys that allow or do not allow the consensus to be accepted and rolled into the cake, using what seems to be with a very simple and open ticket/merge process. \r\n\r\nRegardless of who is writing what, the perception from at least my point of view, is that this project is being stifled by the this confusion and most importantly: makes the people that have their $1B (whatever) invested very vulnerable to any deliberate/unintentional manipulation of the project. Notice I said perception, i.e. this is not an accusation .. it is simply my opinion on what I see as the result of all the decisions being made, which come out as the binary that is Bitcoin. The changelog is testament to your hard work, in all it's awesomeness. (with a few warts here and there) ;) \r\n\r\nHowever the status quo just can not continue. The accounting system is one example of the fragmentation of what SHOULD and WAS INTENDED to be a project for the people by the people, IF I understand Satoshi's philosophy correctly. \r\n\r\nWe get fucked over everyday by things we can not control. The banks, the government, your boss, your wife, your parents, the weather, viruses, bears, lions, hyenas etc etc etc ..  Why should we allow the one thing we DO have the control over to be, frankly, this, screwed up? Seriously guys ... please, for the love of god .. understand, this is NOT a community project, it is not a hobby, it is not behaving like an open source consensus driven entity, and most certainly should not be allowed to be a ego/self interest based entity(as noted by some above). If you want to get all crystal ballish - it CAN and SHOULD  be the future of all mankind, if taken to the the ultimate iteration of being the thing that controls all things. SkyNet is alive ... initiate T1000 lock on Satoshi .... scene opens with with Arnie naked in parking lot ;) \r\n\r\nUntil we can agree on these fundamental principles, this discussion (and ultimately the entire project )  will continue to be a mobius strrip.\r\n\r\nThe perception is that I am a troll that contributes nothing to Bitcoin. That may/or may not be true. I accept both positions. Like me or hate me, I don't think I am wrong. I feel that I have done more than my fair share for this project.. some of it you will never know about. Some of it may be viewed as counter productive,  I don't agree and frankly don't give 2 shits of what anyone thinks about me. Whatever.. Who I am and what I do is not really the point here. Play the ball and not the player. I only say this, because people have the tendency to discredit other peoples opinions based on, as someone above put it, their \"merit\" or their \"expectations\" or \"identifying obligations\" or \"being a troll\" or \"not understanding the OP's question \" or \"understanding the implications to other parties\" or any number of excuses for not doing what NEEDS to be done. As I pointed out, this is not and should not be a merit based project. Consensus can not be merit based. See feudalism, slavery, right to vote, etc etc etc.. as examples of this behaviour. Merit does not automatically mean liberty/freedom/democracy/altruism therefore it can not be the yardstick by which things are measured. \r\n\r\nSimply :\r\nI do not see any mechanism for consensus, and in fact I see the complete opposite. The code that is released is the \"baby\" that is the product of a very small elite groups decisions. Merging or not merging code is the way that this control is accomplished, and that is the reason for this unbelievably long comment. ( Holy shit I can talk a lot of shit sometimes when I am worked up - take solace in the fact that my wife and child have to deal with me everyday - pity them! ) ;) \r\n\r\nThe simple fact is that people do not understand the nuance of the code involved and thus have little capacity to overcome the MASSIVE learning curve required to participate/contribute in any meaningful way,I tried, I failed, I am to old for this, if I was 20 I would rewrite all of this in ASM. I have learnt and forgotten enough programming languages to fill a small dump truck, I have no interest in learning another, especially if it is only for one, very complex project, regardless of my passion for it. My job is in enterprise architecture.. something I have done plenty of at all different levels, so I speak from a perspective that comprehends this all at a view that is above the nitty gritty of the individual code merges, although I do watch all of them with great interest. Kano and Lukes little war is another that amused me endlessly, less so now that I can't afford to spend 50K on any kind of meaningful gear to mine on especially with the price being/doing what it is. \r\n\r\nAnway .. the lack of participation should not be used as an excuse for what is being allowed to perpetuate. i.e. All attempts/opportunities for simplification, THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE NEW BLOOD TO JOIN, seem to be blocked automatically and then defended vehemently, when someone asks: WTF?! Why can't we just make it easier for people to implement/develop/contribute to the code? Why can't there  \"just\" be an API or exposed RPC?etc etc the kinds of questions get torpedoed so fast they must be based on some auto-reply non-heuristic email rules. \r\n\r\nFinally,my dear friends, this is intended as a plea not a admonishment. Can we please, please, please stop playing politics and take ownership of what this project ultimately means for the future, regardless of the influence of what the fiscal positions that people hold or their reliance on obsolete code which should be obliterated not perpetuated ad-infinitum (or so it seems to me). These positions are very obviously skewing the most important strategic decisions (or more often than not the lack of) from being made. Please, take a step back, and do what's right for the project, not what is right from your own personal financial perspective. The major stakeholders with tons of cash invested, can afford more programmers in Bangalor. Don't worry about them. They will be fine. Worry about us. The ones that use it. The ones that vote with their Satoshi's every time a block is generated. Worry about the ones that don't and more importantly WON'T anymore because of some (more than one) very unpleasant events in the past, and I am not talking about SR or BMR   \r\n </my bitcoin philosophy>\r\n\r\nI promise I will no longer pollute this thread with my thoughts. I think I have said it all.. Dunno .. we will see. Depends on who is going to give me a cookie. \r\n\r\nThank you for all your efforts everyone. Please have a happy and prosperous 2015.\r\n\r\nStay frosty. ",

      "body" : "Although I agree that a new rpc interface for a separated wallet is the way to go long term, I'm not convinced that a smaller redesign (maybe just moving to int satoshis and getting rid of accounts) it's a waste of time.\r\nThere's at least 3 things that will require significant refactoring work that I believe go before separating the wallet: moving transaction consensus validation (to be used by libconsensus), moving the p2p protocol messages and as much policy-related code as possible out of main.\r\nFrom those 3 things, it seems to me that something like #4646 (moving p2p messages out of main) is specially important for separating the wallet.\r\nMaybe the first step is separating it in different binaries.\r\nSay, instead of having --disable-wallet, that could be the default for bitcoind, and then have a bitcoind-wallet and bitcoin-client-wallet. Maybe always build bitcoin-qt with wallet.\r\nThen at some point separate the repos (maybe bitcoin core becomes a subrepository of bitcoin-wallet ?). I don't know, maybe this belongs to another issue...\r\nMy point is, without having a roadmap for the wallet separation, postponing any changes to the rpc interface seems like an unnecessary burden. Simplifying or deleting some rpc calls can actually be good for the separation even if bigger changes are going to happen after the separation.\r\n\r\nI would be in favor of declaring accounts deprecated for 0.10 and removing them for 0.11, for example, even if the wallet only gets fully separated by 0.12 or 0.13. \r\n",
