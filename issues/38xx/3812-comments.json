Thinking more about it, doesn't really make much sense.\r\nAnother related idea would be to move TestNet() and RegTest() to be methods of CChainParams.\r\n\r\nTestNet() may seem more convenient than Params().testNet() or Params().isTestNet() but makes the code less readable. Actually my preference would be params.isTestNet(), using a simple instance instead of a const global-ish function, but it's probably better to refactor a little bit at a time.\r\nCould I make that change?",

It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3.
