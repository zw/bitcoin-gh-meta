A Unit of Test\":\r\n\r\n> Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> Don't be mad once you see that they remove it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\r\n> Oh, oh, oh\r\n> Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n> Don't be mad once you see that they remove it\r\n> If you liked it, then you should have put a test on it\r\n\r\nNotes to reviewers:\r\n\r\n* I believe this change to be exhaustive -- no unused methods should be left to discover in the code base (excluding dependencies) after the merge of this PR. Any counter-examples would be very welcome so that I can revisit my methodology!\r\n* Let me know if there are any open PR:s making use of any of these methods, or if there is any compelling evidence that the YAGNI principle does not hold for any of those methods :-)",
