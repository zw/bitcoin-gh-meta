This is still in RFC mode and I'm looking for concept feedback.\r\n\r\n> Seems a lot of new code added for a simplification.\r\n\r\nYes, it's additional LOC. It removes code from validation and simplifies the interface to the mempool, in exchange for adding checking to client code (RPC, wallet). I think that counts as an improvement because all other things being equal, we'd prefer less and simpler code in validation. It also makes sense for me that the client should be responsible for this checking.\r\n\r\n> Also, releasing the locks in between makes this non-atomic: Missing coins are counted as -1 satoshis (instead of their true amount), this can easily lead to not firing an error at all and accepting the tx later on, because the coins became available again.\r\n\r\nYikes!

I think if the original behaviour had looked like this, the change would have been rejected as not worth it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this functionality protect users from loss (including people coming into irc furious that it wouldn't send because it was protecting them... :) ) and it seems likely that there is a lot more that we don't hear about.
