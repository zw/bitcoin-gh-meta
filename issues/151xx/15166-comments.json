This is because the scope of existing suggestions often changes through improvements or bugfixes. \r\n\r\nFor example, the SC2054 warning that commas won't work as an array separator recently had its detection criteria changed, so now shellcheck master (and therefore the next release) will start triggering on `test/lint/lint-format-strings.sh` due to its array containing unquoted `FatalError,0  fprintf,1 ..`\r\n\r\nBy pinning, you can upgrade at your leisure without surprise build breaks.",
