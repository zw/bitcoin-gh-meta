It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in contrib/test-scripts)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.",

Specifically it should return the following:\r\n\r\ntotalin = nTotalBytesIn\r\ntotalout = nTotalBytesOut\r\ntimemillis = (double)GetTimeMillis()/1000\r\n\r\nThe time variable lets the callee accurately determine the actual bandwidth rate even if the RPC call has some latency.

I think it's better readable when you place a space between the values and the unit on the right (dunno if this is a locale thing, I'm just offering just my personal impression).\r\n2. When changing the slider the graphs are reset, guess this is normal?\r\n3. When changing the slider it can give numers like 13.75h any way to make this depend in users locales or perhaps split hours and minutes at least?\r\n4. Can't say why, but 15 minutes resolution sounds too large, graphics look not sharp or clear, I'm missing my wow-factor when looking at it ^^.\r\n5. I wonder why the graphs are only drawn if there is traffic, perhaps I'm missunderstanding something, but if I select 15mins the graph should be pretty much moving steady from right to left?",

Thanks for the other changes!\r\n\r\nOne nit, I saw you connected the clicked() signal to clear() via .ui file, whereas I would prefer:\r\n``connect(ui->btnClearTrafficGraph, SIGNAL(clicked()), ui->trafficGraph, SLOT(clear()));`` in the RPCConsole constructor.\r\n\r\nI know it's THAT easy to connect signals and slots via Qt Designer, but most of the .ui stuff is setup in the code and not in the .ui files. My personal oppinion is that such connections get lost, when browsing code and forgetting about .ui files.",
