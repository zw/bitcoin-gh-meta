The software\r\nrecommends reindexing, but reindexing does not correct the problem.\r\n\r\nThis should be fixed by changing the chainstate serialization, but\r\nworking around it seems harmless for now because the version is not\r\nused by any network rule currently.\r\n\r\nA patch free workaround is to start with -checklevel=2 which skips\r\nthe consistency checks, but the IsStandard change is important for\r\nminers in order to protect unpatched nodes.",
