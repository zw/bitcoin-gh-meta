As there is not a standard format, I think it will do as well as any other.\r\n\r\nIn the details window I could call it TxID-vout instead of just TxID, but in the context menu there is no space for further elaboration.\r\n\r\nSimply dropping the vout index loses information that is needed to drill down to that specific subtransaction [From user viewpoint, the subtransaction is the transaction].\r\nAnd indeed the RPC does not accept TxID-vout format, but that's mainly because the need has never arisen to point at specific subtransactions (AFAIK) so one should remove the subtransaction before submitting it through RPC (which is just deleting the last 4 characters).\r\n\r\nI'm really not convinced that there is a problem (apart from lack of documentation/explanation) here. Unless you have a much better proposal I'd like to keep it this way.\r\n\r\n",

It's also important when handling payments in order to prevent duplicate keys on the txid when you're paid multiple times in a single transaction.\r\n\r\nWhen I write them together I normally use txid:vout, I'm not sure where this form comes from. It's a little annoying that the raw transaction api breaks out the vout, but oh well.\r\n",
