After some digging, we found out this was likely because of the original pay-to-IP protocol, so that unconfirmed dependencies get sent out to receivers automatically (mental note: the payment protocol could use this too). In its current state it is both useless and inefficient (there is a degree of duplication, if you have wallets with many unconfirmed transactions). The solution was to remove it altogether now, and perhaps later re-introduce it when it's useful, in a saner way (without duplication, for starters).",
