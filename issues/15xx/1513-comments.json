Pieter and Mike have both been working on complete re-writes of the block database, though, so spending time working on the current way we're doing things might be a waste of time.\n",

      "body" : "Thanks Gavin. \n\nThis error has been happening to me every couple of months going back to maybe September 2011. I've always upgraded to the latest version hoping the bug would be gone (including clean re-installs) but for some reason I always comes back. It is a pain since the only way to recover is to delete all the block-chain files and re-download. My wallet was never affected though.  \n\nI don't think I ran out of space (although space is tight - I'm running on a 64GB SSD). Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I always send my laptop into 'sleep' mode while running the bitcoin client in the background? \n\nGood to hear a rewrite of the block db is on the way. Sounds like that might fix the issue. ",
