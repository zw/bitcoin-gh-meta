Ruby runs on all of those platforms too.\n\nWhat these scripts do is build a VirtualBox instance containing Ubuntu 12.04, then calls Gitian with USE_LXC=1. It also patches gitian and the gitian build scripts as needed to run within VirtualBox, downloads the various dependencies, etc.",

Gitian is being used simply because it is the most reliable process for doing cross-platform builds of bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt.\n\nIncluded are are a handful of fixes required to get gitian running within an already-virtualized environment, and in time (aka, when I or someone else has time) those patches will be generalized and submitted upstream to gitian-builder. But that should be a minor footnote. This is really about doing cross-platform or local builds without complicated dedicated build servers.",
