It checks for non-zero value and checks for \"textual\" correctness and number-of-digits validation (the last two checks in the parse() call). I do think the non-zero value test isn't correct to be put there (and, for example, the MainOptionsPage doesn't use the validate() method probably for this reason, because 0.00 commissions are ok).\nConsidering the BitcoinAmount::validate() does a \"textual\" validation and a number-of-digits validation, I would stop the QR code from being generated if it isn't valid. \n\nI'll note that there is even a minor bug in the save-as button. If you put too many letters in a field the QR code on the screen will disappear, but the save button will save the last correctly generated QR code.",
