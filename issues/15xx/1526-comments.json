The release after that happens a checkpoint can be added and the code can be simplified to \"require valid v2+ blocks.\"\n\n@luke-jr:  so we release code that creates v2 blocks, but always accepts v1 blocks.  Then a while from now we release code that creates v2 blocks but rejects v1 blocks if some threshold has been reached.  If I'm a miner, why would I risk running that code; I need to SEE network support for the \"reject v1 block\" rule before I start doing that.\n",

Interesting, but not a problem.\n\nThere are also some accidental \"looks like a block height\" blocks (e.g. block 164384 starts its coinbase with PUSH 1983702).\n\nThat opens a tiny window for whoever created block 164384 to try to create a duplicate coinbase in the year 2046 when block 1,983,702 is mined. The chances of them mining that particular block will probably be pretty small, although maybe there would be some incentive for them to sell the private key to a big mining consortium who would... do something evil maybe.\n\nWe could close that remote possibility by giving the coinbase transactions nVersion=2; the transaction's version is part of the transaction id hash, so a nVersion=1 transaction will never hash to the same id as a nVersion=2 transaction.\n\nWe do have the problem that between the time we announce what we're going to do and the time when there is 75% main network support rogue miners could create block.nVersion=2 / coinbase.nVersion=2 coinbases that contain \"height = sometime in the future\".",
