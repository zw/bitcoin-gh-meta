I was not able to find a reliable source that sheds some light on my question.\n\nSee:\nhttp://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qmake-advanced-usage.html\n\nThere is always ``win32`` mentioned. Same for ``mac``, which should perhaps be ``macx``.\n\nAnyway, I tried replacing all occurrences of ``windows`` with ``win32`` and it compiles fine on my local setup. Perhaps a main dev can take a look at this.",
