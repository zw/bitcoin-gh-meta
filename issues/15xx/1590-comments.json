That's what this pull request does.\n2) Once a significant number of miners are doing that, modify the client to estimate what fee (if any) is needed to get into the next block or six, and let the user include a fee on a transaction-by-transaction basis.\n3) Make more improvements to the transaction selection algorithm, like considering dependent transactions' fees when selecting what to include in a block (part of #1240), and roll that out to miners and clients.\n\n",

I wrote the code, and couldn't predict how many free transactions would be included in a block if I made weight1=1 and weight2=1000.\n\nI like this method better; it is clear what will happen if you set -maxblocksize=50000 and -maxfreesize=10000  (defaults are 250,000 and 27,000 which match the behavior of previous releases).
