Rename Window title to ``Bitcoin-Qt - Wallet``\n-> Bitcoin-Qt is the GUI to Bitcoin and this keeps Wallet but separated by \"-\" to ensure users don't think the client is called \"Bitcoin Wallet\".\n2. Rename ``About Bitcoin-Qt`` -> ``About Bitcoin``\n-> We show version stuff that is not the Qt client version, but the Bitcoin \"core\" version.\n3. Rename ``Client`` in the Debug window -> ``Core``, ``Bitcoin Core`` or ``Core Client``\n-> This is clearer in terms of we use the Core and have the Qt GUI on top.\n\nOh and for not knowing Qt, we have an ``About Qt`` in the GUI :).\n\nWhat do you think?",
