   "body" : "Issue happens when confirming a bitcoin transaction that:\r\n* A) Has too many output addresses (Most cases)\r\n* B) In a \"random\" way, when the client repeats 1 output too often. After restarting the system it's fine. After a couple transactions the confirmation prompt content repeats over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe result in A and B is that the buttons to accept or abort a transaction are outside of the screen as they are not fixed but moving down to the very end of the prompt.\r\n\r\nI expected that in case (A) the buttons will be visible on screen no matter how big the transaction is. Make the transaction details scroll-able for example but keep the buttons fixed visible on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be easily reproduced by adding so many output addresses that the confirmation prompt gets bigger and bigger until the buttons disappear. We are talking about 10-15 addresses depending on screen and resolution.\r\n\r\nThe button issue also occurs on Bitcoin Core why the Knots developers redirected to this issue tracker.\r\n\r\nQT Version 5.9.6\r\nBitcoin Knots 0.17.1\r\nWindows 10 Build 1807\r\nIntel i7\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if we have case A or B (which you can see in my screenshot). In the end the prompt becomes to big and the buttons disappear. Only workaround is to play with tab and arrow buttons while being blind and press enter randomly - until you either confirm and broadcast, or mostly just abort by mistake.\r\n\r\n![bug-NEW](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48908278/54910446-3fb75400-4ee4-11e9-8792-4873f2864ab4.png)\r\n\r\n",
