A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting project because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under a somewhat different but not-horrible (IMHO) trust model.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\n~~Right now I've compressed this change into a single commit for ease of rebase.~~ This is a proof-of-concept PR and at the moment I'm just looking for concept ACKs and NACKs. Given that this may never amount to anything but an experimental curiosity, **please refrain from leaving nit reviews**, which would just be a premature burden on our inboxes. If other contributors feel that this change is worthwhile, I'll rebase this into granular commits and then linter savagery can begin in earnest.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with the claimed hash in the snapshot metadata.\r\n   1. We wait until our headers chain contains the base of the snapshot (up to 10 minutes).\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n   1. The mempool is cleared.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n     \r\nMore specifically, changes include:\r\n\r\n- non-validation parts of the system call `CChainState` methods (`chainstate->ActivateBestChain()`), as opposed to functions (`::ActivateBestChain()`) that operate on a particular chainstate. This means I've moved `CChainState` into `validation.h` and turned a few functions (e.g. `FlushStateToDisk()`, `IsInitialBlockDownload()`) into CChainState methods.\r\n\r\n- the coins-view hierarchy data (`pcoinsTip`, `pcoinsdb`, et al.) are no longer globals but instead live as members of each CChainState in an instance of the new `CoinsViews` class. This means that each CChainState governs its own on-disk coinsdb (leveldb) instance. `-dbcache` is split evenly across each CoinsViews instance.\r\n\r\n- management of block metadata that isn't specific to a particular chain (`mapBlockIndex`, `mapBlocksUnlinked`, `m_failed_blocks`, et al) has been broken out of CChainState and put into a new class called `BlockMetadataManager` of which there is a single global instance.\r\n\r\n- the global `chainActive` is no more in lieu of `ChainActive()`, which points to the current most-work chain.\r\n\r\n- a new class `ChainstateManager` manages the creation and wrangling of chainstates. It facilitates construction of a chainstate from UTXO snapshots and provides an interface for other parts of the system to request all applicable chainstates for certain operations (e.g. which chainstates do I want to request blocks for?).\r\n\r\n- minor changes are made to `init.cpp` and `net_processing.cpp` to make simultaneous IBD across multiple chainstates work.\r\n\r\n- all `CValidationInterface` events related to chainstate modification are prefixed with a `CChainState` parameter - this is so that clients know whether they're being notified of an event on the active chainstate or just a background validation chainstate.\r\n\r\n- introduce RPC commands `dumptxoutset`, `loadtxoutset`, and (the probably temporary) `monitorsnapshot`.\r\n\r\nConceptually, it's all pretty simple. The changes look worse than they are since the bulk of the diffs are moves, `chainActive` replacements, and so forth.\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- ~~We don't serve blocks or transactions to the network while we're operating with an unvalidated snapshot-based chain.~~\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously very experimental and I'm not necessarily thinking this will be merged, though I do think this is a viable approach. Obviously if I get a few concept ACKs, I'll need to write a bunch of tests; one incidental benefit of this big changeset is that validation should be a lot more amenable to unittesting after the modularization in these changes.",
