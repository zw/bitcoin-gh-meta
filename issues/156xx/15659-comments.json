I wrote \"ancestor\" here when I really meant \"ancestor-or-self\" because it seemed less awkward (similar to how people write Ã¢ÂÂ instead of Ã¢ÂÂ in math for convenience, even though it can be less clear if you don't know the context).\r\n\r\nI think \"highest block on the chain that is or has an ancestor of the specified block\" is hard to parse, though. Maybe it would be better to change these comments to:\r\n\r\n- findFork: Return height of the specified block if it is on the chain, otherwise return the height of the highest block on chain that's an ancestor of the specified block, or nullopt if there is no common ancestor.\r\n- findLocatorFork: Return height of the highest block on chain in common with the locator (which will either be the original block used to create the locator, or one of its ancestors.)",
