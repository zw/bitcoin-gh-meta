   "body" : "In #11281, commit ccd8ef6 the `LOCK(cs_main)` scope was reduced for the wallet. This does the same for the rest API, which is a huge performance boost for `rest_block` call when used from multiple threads.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure though if this is allowed here...\r\n\r\nMy test setup, on an Intel i7 with 6 cores (12 threads), locked to 3.2GHz:\r\n\r\n1. start a fully synced bitcoind, with this `bitcoin.conf`:\r\n   ```\r\n   server=1\r\n   rest=1\r\n   rpcport=8332\r\n   rpcthreads=12\r\n   rpcworkqueue=64\r\n   txindex=1\r\n   dbcache=2000\r\n   ```\r\n2. Wait until log message shows `loadblk thread exit`, so that bitcoind is idle.\r\n3. Run ApacheBench: 10000 requests, 12 parallel threads, fetching block nr. 600000 in binary:\r\n   ```\r\n   ab -n 10000 -c 12 \"http://127.0.0.1:8332/rest/block/00000000000000000007316856900e76b4f7a9139cfbfba89842c8d196cd5f91.bin\"\r\n   ```\r\nRequests per second:\r\n* 97.434 [ms] (mean) on master\r\n* 20.431 [ms] this branch\r\n\r\nSo this can process 4.8 times as many requests, and saturates all my cores instead of keeping them partly idle waiting in the lock.",
