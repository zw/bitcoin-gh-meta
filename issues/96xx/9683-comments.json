They break down like this:\r\n\r\n27 times it crashed saying just \"Segmentation fault (core dumped)\". All 27 of those crashes happened in QSortFilterProxyModel::sort(int, Qt::SortOrder), before the 'stop' RPC was called, with a stack trace that looked like this in all 27 cases:\r\n\r\n    #9  0x00007f142b329a95 in QSortFilterProxyModel::sort(int, Qt::SortOrder) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5\r\n    #10 0x00007f142c52eff7 in QTableView::setSortingEnabled(bool) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Widgets.so.5\r\n    #11 0x0000562b39ce8f6a in TransactionView::setModel (this=0x562b3d01aa50, _model=_model@entry=0x562b3d1f2d80) at qt/transactionview.cpp:212\r\n    #12 0x0000562b39c89c3f in WalletView::setWalletModel (this=this@entry=0x562b3c6b4da0, _walletModel=0x562b3d1f2d80) at qt/walletview.cpp:121\r\n    #13 0x0000562b39c765c5 in WalletFrame::addWallet (this=0x562b3ccc84c0, name=..., walletModel=<optimized out>) at qt/walletframe.cpp:49\r\n    #14 0x0000562b39bf08b1 in BitcoinApplication::initializeResult (this=0x7ffd182aeea0, success=<optimized out>) at qt/bitcoin.cpp:492\r\n\r\nSo that's by far the most common place it crashed.

For example, it is using setDynamicSortFilter(true) and making sure to do updates to the underlying unsorted model instead of the sorted model. The only strange thing it is doing is calling sortByColumn() after setSortingEnabled() instead of before, so sorting initially happens in an arbitrary order before sort column is set. (It might be worth trying to switch the order of these two statements to see if anything changes.)\r\n\r\nOne thing I don't understand is the stack trace. If crash is actually happening in `build_source_to_proxy_mapping` it is unclear how this would be triggering \"free on address which was not malloc()-ed\" because `QSortFilterProxyModelPrivate::build_source_to_proxy_mapping` should just be filling a preallocated vector based on contents of another vector. I don't see where it would be allocating or deleting anywhere.",

      "body" : "I think the \"deadlock detected\" error reporting is just broken in this case and the error is spurious. The deadlock detection is something we should fix, but for now you could work around it by building without `DEBUG_LOCKORDER`.\r\n\r\nWhat happened is that one `ThreadMessageHandler` thread locked `ppmutexOpenSSL` and then did a `TRY_LOCK` on `cs_main`. The next `ThreadMessageHandler` locked `cs_main` and then `ppmutexOpenSSL`. I don't know the background behind `ThreadMessageHandler`  and `ppmutexOpenSSL`, but the deadlock detection seems broken because it is ignoring the fact that `TRY_LOCK` is different than `LOCK` and would avoid a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThis is a strange bug because deadlock detection code actually seems to _know_ this is a try lock (it prints `net_processing.cpp:3291 (TRY)`) but it aborts and complains anyway.",
