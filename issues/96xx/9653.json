It is agreed that Bitcoin Core is past beta stage, even if blockchains and crypto-currencies are new technologies. The initial `0.` is dropped, meaning that the next version is `14.0` not `0.14.0`.\r\n2. A set of milestones leading up to a 'production ready' version of Bitcoin Core are established, and this is referred to as the `1.0` release.\r\n3. This discussion is irrelevant.\r\n",
