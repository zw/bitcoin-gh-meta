Because it's pretty unlikely for sendtoaddress to fail with 0.13.2, it is possible that the wallet txid it returns didn't get accepted to the mempool, but it doesn't look like a failure.  Do you know if your application failing on `117` was a result of the return value of sendtoaddress or possibly some other logic, like looking for your tx in the mempool?\r\n\r\nThe other thing that's worth thinking about is the tx `6ff221aee6174acc2263c64b1deec94ddfa1ad0b2877b30ccd580476f08ab7e6` which  spends that 66.5 BTC output from the `f60` transaction.  Can you try searching for that in your log and also do a gettransaction on it (in the off chance it has any wallet conflicts)?  If you had generated that one some time ago but it had failed to be accepted to your mempool (in the same way `117` was) then it's possible it would have looked like your money was missing.  But again with 0.13.2, the `6ff` tx should have been continuously tried to be reaccepted to your mempool, so you should not have needed to wait for a block in order to see that money as yours again.\r\n",

      "body" : "> You said you are running 0.13.2 right? Because it's pretty unlikely for sendtoaddress to fail with 0.13.2, it is possible that the wallet txid it returns didn't get accepted to the mempool, but it doesn't look like a failure.\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm running 0.13.2. Unfortunately, I don't log the error, just the fact it failed. So I have no idea why it failed =/. It's even possible it took longer than usual and timed out. Send to address normally takes 5-20 seconds to return, so it could have conceivably hit the 30 second timeout.\r\n\r\n> The other thing that's worth thinking about is the tx 6ff221aee6174acc2263c64b1deec94ddfa1ad0b2877b30ccd580476f08ab7e6 which spends that 66.5 BTC output from the f60 transaction.

      "body" : "What looks like happened here is the `6ff221a` transaction could not be accepted into your mempool at the time you generated it (but it did make it into your wallet).  This leads to a known sub-optimal behavior where it still counts as spending all the inputs it consumes but does not count as crediting your balance with any of its outputs regardless of whether they are change or otherwise to you.  This explains why your balance \"disappeared\".    \r\n\r\nWhat doesn't make sense is why this situation persisted until a restart?  It should have been the case that your node attempted to reaccept that transaction to your mempool roughly every 30 mins.  And the most likely guess is it had too many unconfirmed parents to be accepted originally, so as soon as few of them were confirmed in blocks, it should have been accepted into the mempool.  However it seems to have not made it back into your mempool until you restarted your node.  I haven't been able to come up with a theory on why that might have been the case.\r\n\r\n",
