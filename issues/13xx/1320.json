   "body" : "Hi,\nI've been trying to get my bitcoin client to work now for some time.  I am running windows 7 x64 enterprise.  Every time I uninstall and reinstall the bitcoin-qt client, I get part way through downloading the blockchain and the whole machine locks up.  Can't move the mouse, can't use the keyboard.  I end up doing a hard reset to get the computer back up.  This only happens when the bitcoin client is downloading the blockchain.  Bitcoin is the only program running also.  During normal use I have no other issues.  I just reinstalled the whole machine last week, and it has all updates and such...\n\nWhat can I do?  I am running the latest client as well.  0.6.2\n\nI'm about to try pywallet and see if I can move it to a different client.. Very frustrating.  Any help greatly appreciated!",
