Then build from there.\n\nRemotes are essentially the same, but allow for tracking multiple remote repositories from one local git repository. This can be useful, for example, when you want to create a local branch from the remote branch and continue working on it. Or to do diffs between a branch of your own and the remote one. (However, it also means that you have to first commit your current work to a branch, or stash, before you can check out the other remote branch)\n\nLearning to use git effectively can be a bit of a challenge in the beginning, but it does pay off.\n",
