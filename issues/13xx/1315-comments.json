When i new block arrives on the network, let's say 8 nodes announce it in invs. My node will getdata it from the first one, download it and ProcessBlock it usually well before the last connected peer sends invs for it, so with this code with each new block, the slowest peers to announce it will receive the new getblocks in this fix. As the network gets bigger, this could get worse. It could also get less worse if ProcessBlocks takes longer due to larger blocks.",
