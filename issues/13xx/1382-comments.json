By way of providing some real world data, here are some stats collected from my client's debug log:\r\n\r\n    exarkun@top:~/.bitcoin$ grep \"already have block\" debug.log  | wc -l\r\n    383867\r\n    exarkun@top:~/.bitcoin$ grep \"ProcessBlock: ACCEPTED\" debug.log  | wc -l\r\n    22486\r\n\r\nThat's nearly twenty times more duplicate blocks - redundant, useless traffic - than legitimate, helpful blocks.  If there is no way to tell a peer to stop sending some blocks, and it is not desirable to disconnect from a peer which is now sending unneeded blocks (because they have been retrieved from somewhere else in the meanwhile), then it seems like some other fix at least is needed here.  Perhaps the client shouldn't be so aggressive about sending out duplicate getblocks to multiple peers.  However, as a temporary solution, disconnecting seems sensible to me.  The client will establish connections to other peers (or even the same peers again) and continue exchanging data with them, and having gotten some blocks, *not* ask for them again over the new connection.",

      "body" : "The core of the problem here is that we have two mechanisms:\r\n  1) when we think we don't have all blocks, pick a peer to download them all from\r\n  2) when a new block is announced and we don't have its parents, ask them from the peer who sent it\r\n\r\nThe problem is that these two mechanisms don't place nicely together, and when a new block is found during initial syncup, you end up doing both at once. That's purely a local implementation problem - there is no blame to either of the peers involved, so they should not be disconnected for doing what is asked from them.\r\n\r\nThe solution is writing something of a download manager, which keeps track of which peers have which blocks, and tries to fetch them, and switch if a peer seems unresponsive. In my opinion, this is only really possible once we have headers-first sync, so the best chain is known before starting the actual block download. This would also mean the download can be parallellized.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say we don't need a more immediate solution. It's becoming more and more obvious that the sync mechanism is broken. I think we should aim for a simple solution now which solves the worst, and then really solve it when headers-first is implemented.",

I posit, that this will always be a guess, and therefore unreliable.

      "body" : "I'll try to explain a bit more in detail why this is not a solution, but this is my last comment in this thread.\r\n\r\nAssume we are doing initial block synchronization, so we're sending getblocks, receive invs, download blocks, and send a new getblocks. During that time, a new block is found. One node (typically one of the best!) is the first to announce this new block to us, so we download it, see that we don't have its parents, and we go on to request the headers from this good peer that was so kind to announce a new block to us. Now we are doing the getblocks/invs/getdata/blocks/getblocks sequence from two nodes at one: the original one we were synchronizing from, and the one that announced the new best block. You're eventually going to kill one of these - that will temporarily mitigate the situation of course, but the next time a new block is found while you're still not done synchronizing, the same thing repeats all over again. And every time, you have a large chance of killing your best-connected peer.\r\n\r\nYou say that requesting the same block multiple times is a separate issue. It is not, it is the only issue. And this is what needs fixing, not killing off peers which do the stupid thing we asked them to.",

This 2 minutes is rather arbitrary and not a reliable way to determine that a block has failed to be downloaded. It will even request the same block from another peer even when the original peer is currently sending a block. The code behind this could do with some obvious improvements, and the 2 minute delay should be replaced with something not so time based, IMHO. Perhaps start the timer from the point at which block reception stops, rather than from the point of initial request.",
