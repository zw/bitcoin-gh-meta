      "body" : "Bitcoin has no \"servers\" - it is a peer to peer application that depends on other nodes willing to send you the block chain. A lot depends on which node is selected at startup to synchronize with. Other than that, downloading is not the most time-intensive part usually, rather verifying and indexing all retrieved data is.\n\nThe reference client on bitcoin.org is one that does full validation - i.e. does not require any trust in what peers send it - this is difficult but is what makes bitcoin unique. These fully validating nodes are necessary on the network, but not everyone has to run them. There are other applications (like MultiBit) which do not do full validation, and move some minimal responsibility to the network.\n\nThere is some work already around idea of making the reference client startup in simplified verification mode (which synchronizes very quickly), and then do the full synchronization in the background until it can switch to fully validating mode.",
