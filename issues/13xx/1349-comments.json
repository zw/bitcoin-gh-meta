      "body" : "What I did:\n\nUsed valgrind --tool=callgrind and hacked versions of test/DoS_tests.cpp to isolate and measure just the cached signature verification code.\n\nWhat I found:\n\nTwo things slow down cached signature verification:\n\n1) Decompressing compressed public keys. Using uncompressed public keys almost doubles performance (from 110ms to validate 500 inputs to 60ms). If we need/want to further optimize verification then a compressed->uncompressed cache would get a 25% or so speedup.\n\n2) The remaining 60ms is dominated by the serializing/hashing done; if we needed/wanted to further optimize this code then having transactions cache their SIGHASH_whatever hashes might be worthwhile so they're not repeatedly recomputed. However, the transaction I'm using for this benchmark is not a typical transaction (it has 100 inputs), and the bottleneck for transaction verification might be somewhere else for more realistic transactions.\n\nFinally, in the future very-high-level optimization schemes for transactions might be implemented; for example, if you have a peer that you can completely trust to give you only valid transactions then you could skip all verifications and take it on faith that all transactions from that peer are valid (with, perhaps, a random 1-in-100 audit to make sure the peer hasn't been corrupted). So spending a lot of time on micro-optimizations may not be the best way forward.\n\n",
