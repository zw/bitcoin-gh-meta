Updating the label as well was the original behavior of `ok`, but the code for that has been changed around a \"few\" times (#1092, #858, #1080, #840) so it might be a regression. It is really hard to keep up with peoples expectations with the current form format.\n\nMaybe it would be  better if the label and address were shown as one visual entity, for example email-ish `label [address]` instead of two separate fields. This would prevent confusion as to what the label refers to (#1168) and problems like this, as the entire field is replaced at once.\n\nThe \"Ok\" button on the address book would be better to be explicit \"Choose Address\" when eh, choosing addresses.\n\n",
