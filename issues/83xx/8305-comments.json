      "body" : "Discussed with @gmaxwell on IRC yesterday.  He pointed out one drawback to this approach is that if we were to receive 2 blocks in short succession, such that the first block was still not valid according to the 2hr rule when the second one was received, then we would still fall out of sync.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to push an alternate approach, where instead of just trying once to recover, we do the following: when receiving a HEADERS message with at most a few headers, if the first header doesn't connect, increment a counter and send the peer a getheaders.  If the counter gets too big, assign DoS points, but if a connecting header comes in before that happens, reset the counter to 0.\r\n\r\n@theuni Since DoS points don't ever decay back to 0, I was reluctant to assign DoS points at all when this type of thing happens, because otherwise if you were up and running long enough, you'd eventually disconnect your peers as these situations accumulated points over time.\r\n\r\nOne difference between this and the CMPCTBLOCK handling is that we have to worry about potential infinite looping if our peer is broken, since we're sending a getheaders in response to a headers message.",
