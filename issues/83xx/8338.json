   "body" : "Having un-needed bitcoin addresses presents a privacy problem in bitcoin core's wallet, because they can be sprinkled with (possibly dust) amounts of money, and when that money gets (automatically)  spent, it provides lots a lot of extra information that can be used to cluster/analyze the wallet.\n\nBitcoin services that need extra privacy (and use bitcoin core) tend to get around this by periodically rebuilding an entire new wallet (which is a pain in the ass). My preferred solution to the problem would be a simple: `bitcoin-cli removeaddress $addr` which could both tackle the privacy problem as well as wallet bloating over time\n",
