Add a boolean parameter to encryptwallet to force regeneration of the seed?\r\n\r\nMaybe another solution would be to allow a startup argument -encryptwallet=<password> which would directly encrypt wallets during the phase of creation.

Isn't each derived private key stored in the wallet as it is derived? If so, changing the seed as we encrypt won't invalidate old backups any more than encrypting already does in v0.12 and earlier. When we encrypt a wallet in v0.12 we invalidate the keypool that was written in the old backup, while maintaining the validity of the backup for private keys which had already been used at the time of the backup. Changing the HD seed should be the same as that, so long as the private keys that were already derived have been written to the wallet file.\r\n\r\nIt appears as if the intention of this BIP32 implementation is to make the change pretty much invisible to the user. But we have accidentally introduced a new security hole: it is now impossible (without disabling the HD feature) to create an encrypted wallet without the unencrypted HD seed being written to wallet.dat.",
