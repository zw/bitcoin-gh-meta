But apparently some analysis tools are much more mature for C than for C++ and we could potentially benefit from them for consensus code if it was C. Maybe @gmaxwell can say more about this.

      "body" : "@MarcoFalke well, I was asking on the general guideline. It makes sense to open both options because we don't know what's going to be merged first. That's what I've been doing so far: any changes after a moveonly have been mostly ignored and the moveonlies themselves, separated or not, have been delayed forever. With the exception of this PR and #8341 all \"dumb fixes\" have been already done.\r\nWe need to make new consensus functions to be populated with code from main, mostly from connectBlock. But those functions will need to call existing consensus functions. Therefore either we move before doing that or we introduce a circular dependency between the new consensus file and main that won't be resolved until the existing consensus functions are moved out of main.\r\nPlus people would have a place to write new consensus functions like, say SequenceLocks() better than main.\r\nSorry, maybe we should discuss this in #8329",
