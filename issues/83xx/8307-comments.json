This means that a miner could make the last output [realCommitment ... padding ... fakeCommitment] and then after midstate compression all the validator of the proof sees is [padding ... fakeCommitment].\r\n\r\nTo make it concrete and real, let's say that namecoin changes to using the segwit nonce to contain their aux header for merged mining. A single miner could commit to two blocks in this way.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The reason the end-of-last-output trick works is that the validator then checks that all that follows is the 4-byte locktime, which is information it does have.",

      "body" : "@sipa The last commitment _which starts an output_. In a midstate utilizing proof one cannot be certain if the proof given is at the start of an output or inside a push statement later in that output. Full validators need the whole coinbase, yes, but proof validators may not. They might only be interested in the the commitment itself, in which case it is a huge drag to include the whole coinbase and its kilobytes of coinbase payouts, the data for which might be larger than the rest of the proof. To illustrate, it would also be acceptable if it was made a consensus rule that after the actual commitment that is the last one to start an output, there is no instance in the serialization of the sequence of bytes which indicate a commitment. Then the proof checker just does a linear scan of the remaining bytes for the segwit commitment marker and fails if it sees two. But this is layer violating to the extreme and a pain to enforce.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell It is important to consider which hardware is broken. The only hardware I can think of that is affected by this change is one that bakes in coinbase construction logic so as to force the owner of the hardware to pay a share to the manufacturer, while the manufacturer recouped costs on sale and isn't paying any portion of the electricity. This is firmware-enforced rent collection, and I'm very surprised if bricking hardware with that 'feature' is something we'd feel badly about. Are there other devices that would be broken by this change?\r\n\r\n@petertodd I have lost track of how many times (8? 9?) p2pool has hardforked its share chain. That's really not a roadblock.",
