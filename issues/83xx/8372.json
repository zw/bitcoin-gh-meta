   "body" : "Using `AddRef()` in `ConnectNode()` for existing connections doesn't feel right imo considering how refs are released in `ThreadSocketHandler()` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L1113. I guess this could be the reason that sometimes refs stay >0 no matter what and nodes stuck in `vNodesDisconnected` forever which means that node never get deleted and `FinalizeNode` signal is never fired which in its turn means that for example `mapBlocksInFlight` can't be cleaned properly and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7596 happens.\r\n\r\nThis commit should solve the issue by:\r\n1. removing `AddRef()` for existing connections\r\n2. adding `AddRef()` in `CNode`'s constructor using the same conditions as in `ThreadSocketHandler()`",
