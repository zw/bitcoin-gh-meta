      "body" : "The \"name\" parameter in `loadwallet` isn't just a simple name. Could be a:\r\n1. Path where a directory can be created.\r\n2. Path to an existing directory.\r\n3. Path to a symlink to a directory.\r\n4. The name of a data file in `-walletdir`.\r\n\r\nSo, depends on how the wallet was initially loaded (from which of those options), the stored \"wallet name\" inside the wallet class will be different. So, only a `GetWallet(name)` check before loading the db wouldn't work if you load the same wallet in two different ways. Eg: load a wallet by name first (location inside `-walletdir`), then load it by its path.",
