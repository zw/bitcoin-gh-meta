At feerates lower than long_term_feerate this\r\nmeans that a waste of 0 may be a suboptimal solution and this causes the\r\nsearch to exit prematurely.\r\nOnly when the feerate is equal to the long_term_feerate would achieving\r\na waste of 0 indicate that we have achieved an optimal solution,\r\nbecause it would mean that the excess is 0. It seems unlikely\r\nthat this would ever occur outside of test cases, and even then we\r\nshould prefer solutions with more inputs over solutions with fewer\r\naccording to previous decisionsâbut solutions with more inputs are found\r\nlater in the branch exploration.\r\n\r\nThe \"optimization\" described in #18257 and implemented in #18262 is\r\ntherefore a premature exit on a suboptimal solution and should be reverted.",
