The biggest problem is already covered by #993, which is that the standard way people uninstall the wallet won't get rid of the blockchain data, and that manually deleting this is risky if the user is not careful.\r\n\r\nOnce a user finds out that they didn't save as much space as expected, they'll Google how to manually do this. If they use Finder to look at their Library directory, they can't possibly miss \"Bitcoin\". If they use the console and are lazy enough to use tab completion, they won't miss it either.\r\n\r\nThat said, I like the idea of renaming the app to just \"Bitcoin\" on OSX, as \"QT\" doesn't add any value and I don't think it has much brand value these days, unlike e.g. \"Bitcoin Core\". But such a rename doesn't seem worth the risks @laanwj described.\r\n\r\nI created #11959 specifically for OSX uninstall. ",
