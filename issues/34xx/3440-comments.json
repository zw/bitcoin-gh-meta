The wallets/keystores already have a few signals (currently used by the GUI), so moving these to some common interface class and letting modules know about registered/unregistered wallets would solve this\r\n\r\n@luke-jr That would be possible. A module could provide 'a way to submit commands', such as JSON-over-zeromq as alternative to the current JSON RPC HTTP server. Only the RPC command table really needs to stay in the main part, to make it possible for modules to register commands in the first place.\r\n",

And it's relatively simple to extend ZeroMQ with websockets, rpc, and/or http.\r\n\r\nSo is modularization still on the table?",
