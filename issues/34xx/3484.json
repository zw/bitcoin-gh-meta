Full log here: http://pastebin.com/zPDfi8s8 This is from a completely fresh install. In fact it's from the bitcoin's first ever run on my system. \r\n\r\nWhy can't it access the file it just created itself? Other programs can open and save to it fine.\r\n\r\nI just installed bitcoin but I've had the same issue with other wallets for weeks. It's the same for all alt-coin wallets I've tried. I have over 26GB available and am running the client as administrator.",
