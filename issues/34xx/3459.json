According to common convention, a directory created under Library, say:  `~/Library/Application Support/${TheApp}` should match, or start with, the name of its creator. Dependent files can start with \"TheApp\", e.g. you can have `TheApp-common` and so on.\r\n\r\nIn our case of the GUI BitCoin client, the application is distributed as \"**Bitcoin-Qt**\" and as a consequence anyone looking for related files will fail finding `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin` as it does not match =~ `/^Bitcoin-Qt.*/`. *AppZapper* is a common example of this.\r\n\r\nRelated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5029410/how-to-detect-files-related-to-an-app-on-a-mac\r\n",
