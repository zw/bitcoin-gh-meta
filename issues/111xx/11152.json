   "body" : "I have intentionally avoided touching DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_SIZE_LIMIT to err on the site of caution, but this is something I'd like to see lifted again.\r\n\r\nDue to the ridiculous transaction fees required these days, it's not really economically sane to rely on bitcoin core's wallet for processing deposits and withdrawals. So I have been helping a company come up with a pretty low-tech solution, and have a simple structure:\r\n\r\n* Deposits go into a wallet A\r\n* They are periodically swept to wallet B, with an extremely low fee\r\n* Withdrawals are processed from wallet C. When extra funds are needed, they are immediately sent from wallet B.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever continually sending payments from wallet C, this structure results in very long transaction chains. Even when being responsible and batching in 1 minute sends, it'll very often hit against the current limits which is fun for no one.\r\n\r\nFor a background of why the limit was previously lowered from 100 to 25:\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-October/011401.html",
