      "body" : "ACK. The current settings are reprehensible: They result in _guaranteed_ income reduction for anyone who follows them for almost no measurable benefit-- because as we see almost everyone maxes them out regardless.   The losses are also not trivial, but are often about 5% of mining income-- which wasn't the case when they were last discussed but is now.\r\n\r\nLuke's argument rests on an unlikely and now conclusively disproven theory that miners will individually act against their own short term economic best interests to preserve the usability of the network. This is demonstratively false and even if it were true, setting an economically rational default wouldn't change it. (these hypothetical altruistic miners would simply lower their defaults, if they existed)\r\n\r\nTo the limited extent that anyone does mine with these defaults (not much) they also make fee estimates less reliable by adding additional variance to the capacity of the network.  A few blocks showing up underfilled is doing no one any favors-- it doesn't meaningfully reduce the initial synchronization time. All it does is lower the revenue of those who do it.  To the extent that any of that is driven by a genuine desire to aid the network (rather than just misconfiguration)-- do we really want people who want to help to be less successful (and thus less able to add hashpower and increase their influence)\r\n\r\nSetting the defaults in a way which virtually no one will use also has the problem of causing people to change the default and then when the way the options works needs to change their outdated settings can cause unexpected behavior. For example, there are many miners who have set the max size to a million bytes to override these broken defaults. And then with segwit they'll be producing undersized blocks unintentionally.  They may even be paying enough attention to realize they need to change them, only to set them to 2 million bytes and _still_ produce undefilled blocks.\r\n\r\nSetting a reduced default against the traffic in the network today violates the principle the software should act in the interest of the people using it and in doing so shows disrespect where none is intended, it violates the principle that absent significant harm to it users it should act in the public interest (by making fee estimation less reliable). \r\n\r\nIMO if it isn't reduced it should be removed completely. At least there is a strong argument that miners producing blocks which fail to confirm all transactions is harmful to the public interest, and improvements in block propagation have largely eliminated size based considerations as legitimate reasons to choose to produce a smaller block.  (Moreover if one was for some reason still concerned about size impacts on propagation the received time sensitive framework from Suhas would be the right way to go about it, not simply reducing the maximum size.)",

That is completely different from 4 MB, and does not prove they will increase to 4 MB immediately in any sense.\r\n\r\n> Luke's argument rests on an unlikely and now conclusively disproven theory that miners will individually act against their own short term economic best interests to preserve the usability of the network. \r\n\r\nIt has not been disproven. Miners have been given bad advice.\r\n\r\n> setting an economically rational default wouldn't change it.\r\n\r\nOnly in the case that the default doesn't matter. In which case, the argument to change the default falls apart completely.\r\n\r\n> For example, there are many miners who have set the max size to a million bytes to override these broken defaults. And then with segwit they'll be producing undersized blocks unintentionally. \r\n\r\nIf they want 1 MB, then their configuration of 1 MB should get them 1 MB. *There is no such thing as undersized blocks.*\r\n\r\n> Setting a reduced default against the traffic in the network today violates the principle the software should act in the interest of the people using it and in doing so shows disrespect where none is intended,\r\n\r\nNo such principle has been established. Defaults should within reason be what is best for Bitcoin as a whole.\r\n\r\n> it violates the principle that absent significant harm to it users it should act in the public interest (by making fee estimation less reliable).\r\n\r\nFee estimation is an unrelated matter. If it can't handle a variety of block sizes, that's a bug in the estimation logic.\r\n\r\n> improvements in block propagation have largely eliminated size based considerations as legitimate reasons to choose to produce a smaller block.\r\n\r\nNo, they haven't. Block propagation has been \"solved\" by centralised relay networks (FIBRE) and SPV mining, both of which are harmful to the network and not real solutions. Additionally, the most bandwidth-contrained users run in `blocksonly` mode, which doesn't benefit from compact blocks or other such improvements. Furthermore, none of this addresses the issue of block*chain* size and IBD, at all.\r\n\r\nAgain, NACK.\r\n\r\n(Maybe #3229 can be reopened?)",

That is completely different from 4 MB, and does not prove they will increase to 4 MB immediately in any sense.\r\n\r\nI will treat any arguments regarding defaults as if they were arguments for a lower value for DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT, not as arguments for the removal/deprecation of blockmaxsize in itself.\r\nRegarding all those arguments, here's all I have to say: I trust miners to end up doing what's economically better for them, but I'm not opposed to a very low default for DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT. I think that will only prove that the default won't matter at all unless it's economically optimal or close: otherwise it'll be a few accidental bad blocks, perhaps the lower the default the faster they will read about the option. \r\nI'm also not opposed to saving the unnecessary disruption, since as others have argued that would only change their default to something unexpected.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK\r\n ",

If someone really wants to mine based on number of serialized bytes (which I doubt), they should use different software; this software is optimized for fee-per-weight.  \r\n\r\nAnyone is free to work on software that optimizes for other properties, but not in this project please; we've gone to considerable effort to optimize for miner income given the consensus rules.  This helps level the playing field amongst miners, so that one needn't be a software engineer in order to be competitive.  I think this is obviously good for the network.\r\n\r\nACK faeafe2.  \r\n\r\nnit: Perhaps edit the commit message on that last commit to say `Add release notes describing blockmaxsize deprecation` rather than `...blockmaxweight deprecation...`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If someone really wants to mine based on number of serialized bytes (which I doubt), they should use different software; this software is optimized for fee-per-weight.\r\n\r\nIt's not deceptive at all. It limits the max size of blocks produced. It makes no statement on what policy is used to select transactions, at all.\r\n\r\n> Anyone is free to work on software that optimizes for other properties, but not in this project please; we've gone to considerable effort to optimize for miner income given the consensus rules. \r\n\r\nThere is no project policy to only optimise for miner income, nor should there be. The incentives on Bitcoin mining are clearly broken, and we should encourage behaviour beneficial to the network at least until such a time as those incentives are no longer broken. To do otherwise is suicide.",

At least some people believed it refers to stripped size, and feared setting it higher than 1M.\r\n\r\nAnd there is no need for that extra complication. We don't have options to limit the number of sigops, the maximum number of inputs, or the maximum change in UTXO set size. I believe all of these are more relevant to network health than serialized size of blocks. But I don't see anyone arguing that functionality should be built in to let GBT restrict by those. Why? Because nobody will use an option that makes them actively lose money, and we shouldn't expect them to.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for size now. With SegWit, the constrained resource is weight.\r\n\r\n> There is no project policy to only optimise for miner income, nor should there be.\r\n\r\nI do think it should be project policy to focus on features that matter.
