   "body" : "`CWallet::MarkConflicted` may acquire the `cs_main` lock after `CWalletDB::LoadWallet` acquires the `cs_wallet` lock during wallet initialization. (`CWalletDB::LoadWallet` calls `ReadKeyValue` which calls `CWallet::LoadToWallet` which calls `CWallet::MarkConflicted`). This is the opposite order that `cs_main` and `cs_wallet` locks are acquired in the rest of the code, and so leads to `POTENTIAL DEADLOCK DETECTED` errors if bitcoin is built with `-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER`.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes `CWallet::LoadWallet` (which calls `CWalletDB::LoadWallet`) to acquire both locks in the standard order.\r\n\r\nError was reported by @luke-jr in https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/90244330/",
