It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts\n2. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n3. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n4. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n",
