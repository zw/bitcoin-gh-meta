When it happened, I could still type more commands\r\nin the console (though without getting an answer), but meanwhile also the debug-widget\r\nhas dropped dead and doesn't redraw anymore. I'll leave it stuck for a while and will look\r\nback in this thread for debugging instructions before killing&restarting it...\r\n\r\nPS: gdb says, it's stuck in pthreads_cond_wait in boost::unique_lock\r\n  in AddressTableModel::labelForAddress(QString)\r\n  in TransactionTableModel::lookupAddress(string,bool)\"",
