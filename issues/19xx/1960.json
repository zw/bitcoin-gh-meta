When it happened, I could still type more commands\nin the console (though without getting an answer), but meanwhile also the debug-widget\nhas dropped dead and doesn't redraw anymore. I'll leave it stuck for a while and will look\nback in this thread for debugging instructions before killing&restarting it...\n\nPS: gdb says, it's stuck in pthreads_cond_wait in boost::unique_lock\n  in AddressTableModel::labelForAddress(QString)\n  in TransactionTableModel::lookupAddress(string,bool)\"\n",
