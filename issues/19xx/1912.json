Because it takes a little while some things that just take time to resolve (e.g. confirmation count going up on transactions) is very aggressively believed to be the magical cure all.\r\n\r\nEither that or there are a whole litany of nasty bugs all over the client, some totally unrelated to the wallet, which are cured by rescan which aren't being reported because people have a workaround.\r\n\r\nInstead perhaps we should rename rescan to  -frobnicate-wallet-transaction-index.",
