   "body" : "We should not use \"BIP125\" as synonymous with our RBF policy because:\r\n- Our RBF policy is different from what is specified in BIP125, for example:\r\n    - the BIP does not mention our rule about the replacement feerate being higher (our Rule 6)\r\n    - the BIP uses minimum relay feerate for Rule 4, while we have used incremental relay feerate since #9380\r\n    - the \"inherited signaling\" question (CVE-2021-31876). Call it discrepancy, ambiguous wording, doc misinterpretation, or implementation details, I would recommend users refer to doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md\r\n    - the signaling policy is configurable, see #25353\r\n- Our RBF policy may change further\r\n- We have already removed BIP125 from docs/bips.md since 1fd49eb498c75a1d14193bb736d195a3dc75ae12\r\n- See comments from people who are not me recently:\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#discussion_r909507429\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25575#issuecomment-1179519204\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all non-signaling mentions of BIP125 (if people feel strongly, we can remove all mentions of BIP125 period). It may be useful to refer to the concept of \"tx opts in to RBF if it has at least one nSequence less than (0xffffffff - 1)\" as \"BIP125 signaling\" because:\r\n- It is succint.\r\n- It has already been widely marketed as BIP125 opt-in signaling.\r\n- If/when we have other ways to signal in the future, we can disambiguate them this way. See #25038 which proposes another way of signaling, and where I pulled these commits from.\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n- Changing our policy to match BIP125. This doesn't make sense as, for example, we would have to remove the requirement that a replacement tx has a higher feerate (Rule 6).\r\n- Changing BIP125 to match what we have. This doesn't make sense as it would be a significant change to a BIP years after it was finalized and already used as a spec to implement RBF in other places.\r\n- Document our policy as a new BIP and give it a number. This might make sense if we don't expect things to change a lot, and can be done as a next step.\r\n",
