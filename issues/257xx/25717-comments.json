(And our starting point for those syncs will be further behind, because we don't make progress on adding headers to our block index until phase 2.)\r\n\r\nI opened #25720 as a mitigation for this effect; many strategies are possible and I think they are orthogonal to the change proposed here, so I'd prefer to leave the discussion of this particular issue to that PR.",

If so, perhaps it's possible to instead keep track of chainwork again in the second phase rather than remembering the exact hash at which the threshold was reached in the first phase?",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer of size H, and only\n+ * accept a batch of N (N < H) headers to memory once we've verified that H/N =\n+ * S commitments have all passed verification.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer of size H, and only\n+ * accept a batch of N (N < H) headers to memory once we've verified that H/N =\n+ * S commitments have all passed verification. With this parametrization, we\n+ * can achieve a given security target (S) while choosing H and N to minimize\n+ * memory usage in this scheme.\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params);\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** INITIAL_DOWNLOAD means the peer has not yet demonstrated their\n+         * chain has sufficient work */\n+        INITIAL_DOWNLOAD,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Start headers sync (via this download-twice mechanism)\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * initial_headers: first batch of headers to process\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    std::optional<CBlockLocator> StartInitialDownload(const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const\n+            std::vector<CBlockHeader>& initial_headers, const arith_uint256&\n+            minimum_required_work, CBlockLocator&& chain_start_locator);\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * headers: headers that were received over the network for processing\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * headers_to_process: will be filled in with any headers that the caller\n+     *                     can process and validate now (because these returned\n+     *                     headers are on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * processing_success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                     aborted; true otherwise.\n+     */\n+    std::optional<CBlockLocator> ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>& headers,",

It could also live on the devwiki or just linked-to in the code. Opinions?\r\n>\r\n> Maybe contrib/devtools? Devwiki seems fine too, no strong opinion.\r\n\r\nMy current thinking is to add it to contrib/devtools in a follow-up PR, together with instructions in the release-process to run/update it. No need to add the review burden of that here, as the current values are likely more than sufficient for at least a few years.\r\n\r\n> I have some questions trying to understand headerssync_params.py.\r\n> Why is `BLOCK_INTERVAL = timedelta(seconds=598, microseconds=800000)` rather than exactly 10min ([link](https://gist.github.com/sipa/016ae445c132cdf65a2791534dfb7ae1#file-headersync_params-py-L13))? Is it for expected hashrate increase?\r\n\r\nYes, the number is just the average block rate in 2021, approximately. It barely matters, so I've changed it to just 600 seconds. A few percent off on this value isn't going to change the result.\r\n\r\n> And based on \"especially as this attack is only possible before the victim has learned about the honest chain\" ([link](https://gist.github.com/sipa/016ae445c132cdf65a2791534dfb7ae1#file-headersync_params-py-L86-L89)) does this mean we should always attempt to sync headers from all/multiple outbound peers at once?\r\n\r\nI don't think so; that also worsens the attack potential in addition to reducing it, because it increases the chance that at least one of the nodes synced from will be an attacker, and gives them a window while the first (eventually) successful hasn't reached the second stage yet.\r\n\r\nAnd syncing from all peers at once is a pretty extreme position to take from a bandwidth optimization perspective (in non-attack scenarios). For most aspects of the P2P protocol, we attempt to never request the same thing twice simultaneously (this is true for transactions and blocks, except the high-bandwidth compact block mode which makes a bounded number of exceptions). Headers are small, so strictly requiring only a single header sync in flight is pretty extreme and opens up the ability for peers to stall the sync for a long time, but fetching from all at once means wasting possibly several GB of volume. #25720 picks something in between: start one sync for each new block announcement.",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer of size H, and only\n+ * accept a batch of N (N < H) headers to memory once we've verified that H/N =\n+ * S commitments have all passed verification.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer of size H, and only\n+ * accept a batch of N (N < H) headers to memory once we've verified that H/N =\n+ * S commitments have all passed verification.

So in this logic we also are checking whether the sync has to end because our peer has no more headers to give us (ie the headers message we processed from them was not full, and the chain has too little work).",

      "body" : "@pinheadmz  of the three attack scenarios in the paper, 1.3 is prevented because we ignore unsolicited blocks with less work than the tip (see [p2p_unrequested_blocks.py](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/p2p_unrequested_blocks.py#L22-L24)). The paper also points this out in (2). So the two attacks to worry about are 1.1 and 1.2. If you can solve 1.2 without the use of checkpoints, then 1.1 is automatically solved.\r\n\r\nSo the comparison boils down to: how does this PR stack up against the proposal in the paper in fixing 1.2.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the solutions we're looking at are 4.2 and 4.3 in the paper, since 4.1 (headers-first sync) is already implemented.\r\n\r\nNote that bandwidth for headers is only a fraction of bandwidth for blocks. All things equal less bandwidth is better, but it's not a huge factor on its own when comparing the approaches.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for elapsed time. Downloading headers takes only a fraction of the time of downloading blocks.\r\n\r\nAlso, because we can receive headers unsolicited, the amount of time and bandwidth we spend downloading useless headers is somewhat out of our control (rate limiting based on PoW could help though, see my comment on 4.3).\r\n\r\nI think there's two metrics we should care about, given an ongoing spam attack and a single honest node whispering the truth:\r\n1. how long does it take until we know enough to go ahead and download the corresponding blocks\r\n2. how much of disk space gets wasted with spam headers (and can we prune that before it becomes a serious problem)\r\n\r\nOne meta issue is that afaik there's no Bitcoin Core pull request of 4.1 and 4.2 from the paper, so that works in favor of this PR which does have working code (from a [rfc7282](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7282) point of view). But the paper states there _is_ an implementation for Bcoin, so this is not a strong argument against. What do we know of how these implementations work in practice?\r\n\r\nWith all that out the way, how do the proposals 4.2 and 4.3 from the paper actually compare to this PR?\r\n\r\n4.2 suggests picking a maximum number of header chains to store, before pruning the shortest. It suggests storing 10 chains for a total of 480MB.\r\na) that's far more memory use than this PR requires (~700 KiB per peer, regardless of the amount of spam fired at us)\r\nb) In terms of bandwidth, under nice circumstances the approach uses less bandwidth, because headers are only downloaded once. But under attack circumstance most of the bandwidth is spent on downloading spam headers, in which case the redownload of correct headers is negligible. That goes for 4.2 as well as this PR.\r\nc) I'm not sure how the proposal holds up in a timewarp attack; I suppose it could perform the sane initial sanity checks on all header chains, e.g. checking the difficulty adjustment is allowed. Dealing with a timewarp attack is important because it would dramatically increase the space needed to store a header chain.\r\n\r\n4.3 Rate limiting header requests: I'm not sure how to evaluate that (others on the mailinglist also expressed difficulty with that). I do notice the paper points to advantages for CPU use, but I'm more worried about storage.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params);\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        UNSTARTED,\n+        /** INITIAL_DOWNLOAD means the peer has not yet demonstrated their\n+         * chain has sufficient work */\n+        INITIAL_DOWNLOAD,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Start headers sync (via this download-twice mechanism)\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * initial_headers: first batch of headers to process (assumes the caller\n+     *                  has already verified the headers connect)\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    std::optional<CBlockLocator> StartInitialDownload(const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const\n+            std::vector<CBlockHeader>& initial_headers, const arith_uint256&\n+            minimum_required_work, CBlockLocator&& chain_start_locator);\n+\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::optional<CBlockLocator> locator{std::nullopt};\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> headers_to_process;\n+        bool success{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *          Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect.\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.headers_to_process: will be filled in with any headers that the caller\n+     *                       can process and validate now (because these returned\n+     *                       headers are on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.locator: if present, the next locator to send in a\n+     *                       getheaders message\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&",

After this PR they can stall us regardless of the how fast the headers are sent. But just sending headers slowly is simple enough to implement, so I suppose this PR does not make that problem worse.\r\n\r\nThis is not my understanding. Peers that we initially choose for headers sync currently have a time window of ~20 minutes (15min `HEADERS_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_BASE` + a component based on the expected number of headers). If we don't have an up-to-date best header by then (no matter if we even received that from them or another peer), then they get disconnected. This logic is unaffected by this PR, although peers now have to serve the headers chain twice within these 20 minutes, so they need to be twice as fast.\r\nMaybe it could make sense to add some criteria based on actual progress to this - if a peer has failed to serve us a single header for 10 minutes, does it really make sense to give them another 10 minutes?\r\n\r\nThe fact that we may also pick additional peers to sync headers from whenever a new block is found (10 minutes on average, but obviously very fluctuating) is independent from that, and also independent from the behavior of a potentially stalling peer. It could sometimes happen a few seconds after the headerssync start if a lucky block is mined then.\r\n",

This seems a very robust way to avoid a whole lot of duplicate work/bandwidth. It means that if we've received (in 2nd phase) headers from peer A up to height H, while we're simultaneously syncing headers (phase 1 or 2) from peer B at height below H, the locator we send to B will make them instantly skip ahead to wherever we already are with A (starting a new phase 1 there). If we've finished syncing with A, it will cause an abort with B if they only have the same headers.\r\n* Add a bunch of logging\r\n* Interface changes:\r\n  * The `StartInitialSynchronization` function is gone; part of its arguments are moved to the constructor, the initial headers argument to it is moved to the caller having to invoke `ProcessNextHeaders`. This removes some duplication in functionality, and simplifies the implementation too, as now `PeerManagerImpl::TryLowWorkHeadersSync` can invoke `PeerManagerImpl::IsContinuationOfLowWorkHeadersSync` to actually deal with the headers, removing some duplication that was introduced by the tip-mixing above.\r\n  * The `MakeNextHeadersRequest` function is now part of the public interface, and is expected to be invoked by the caller when `ProcessNextHeaders` reports `request_more` (rather than being invoke in-line by `ProcessNextHeaders` directly). This avoids the need to lock `cs_main` when nothing is to be requested (to get the global best header tip).\r\n\r\nA rebased, squashed, version of all the commits: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202208_headerssync",

The problem was that when asking for the initial headers from a peer (outside of the HeadersSyncState logic), we ask for one block earlier than our actual tip, so that we always get a meaningful result back, even if the peer has the same tip already. However, in my logic to mix in the tip into HeadersSyncState getheader requests, I didn't make it make this one-step-back. The result was that if you transition from one peer to another when headers syncing, you'd initialize at one block backward, but then the first headers arriving after that would start one further, causing an abort and restart.",

      "body" : "> Do we need to rethink our headers sync timeout and/or disconnect logic? What happens when the first peer we try to do a headers sync with sends a low work chain? Since we don't disconnect, is there another mechanism that causes us to try with another peer, or do we wait for a timeout or new block announcement? (trying to figure this out from just reading net_processing.cpp is daunting...)\r\n\r\n> So currently peers can stall us by sending valid headers slowly (ensuring the first checkpoint is not reached within ~10 minutes). After this PR they can stall us regardless of the how fast the headers are sent. But just sending headers slowly is simple enough to implement, so I suppose this PR does not make that problem worse.\r\n\r\nNote that ever since #5927, checkpoints only affect block/block header validation AFTER we have downloaded a headers chain that includes the checkpointed hashes.  So when a new node is starting up for the first time, if its initial headers sync peer serves a bogus chain, it would still be validated and accepted (even if it includes blocks at heights that have different block hashes checkpointed at those heights), because the main chain with the checkpointed block hashes wouldn't have been downloaded yet.\r\n\r\nBut that distinction is not so important, because for the purposes of (1) determining when the initial headers sync peer is bad/broken, or (2) determining whether a new node starting up can be flooded with low difficulty headers, an adversary has other options to cause us the same problems.  In the case of issue (1), as @mzumsande explained, for bandwidth reasons we give our initial headers sync peer roughly 20 minutes before we'll disconnect them if we haven't yet seen a chain that looks close to caught up.  So a peer looking to stall us can just give us _no headers at all_ (rather than give us a bogus headers chain) and can still stall us for the same amount of time, under that check.  In the case of issue (2), even if block hashes were being checked at the checkpointed heights prior to downloading a chain with those hashes, an adversary looking to waste our memory could just give us a lots of chains that start at genesis and build up to the first checkpoint, and then restart from genesis again with a new chain.\r\n\r\nI believe this PR completely solves issue (2).\r\n\r\nRegarding issue (1): for a very long time, our protection against a stalling peer has been that we will initiate headers sync (via a `getheaders` message) with any peer sending us a block INV.  This is overkill and made somewhat more bandwidth-wasteful after this PR, so #25720 tries to strike a better balance between robustness in the face of stalling peers, and bandwidth usage.  However I believe exactly how we strike that balance is orthogonal to the behavior introduced here, so it makes more sense to discuss strategies for when we start to sync headers with a peer in that PR, rather than here.",

Imagine that some adversary has given us 10 bogus chains, and we connect to an honest peer for the first time.  What do we do during headers sync with that peer, in the window of time that the headers we're downloading are far behind (in work) from the work on the bogus chains we have stored already?

Couldn't we also just keep the commitments, track our index with an integer and then delete the whole thing when we're done?\r\n\r\nTwo reasons, I think -- one is that we use more memory that way, the other is that the bookkeeping seemed more complicated to think about than if we pop entries as we go.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params);\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        UNSTARTED,\n+        /** INITIAL_DOWNLOAD means the peer has not yet demonstrated their\n+         * chain has sufficient work */\n+        INITIAL_DOWNLOAD,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Start headers sync (via this download-twice mechanism)\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * initial_headers: first batch of headers to process (assumes the caller\n+     *                  has already verified the headers connect)\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    std::optional<CBlockLocator> StartInitialDownload(const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const\n+            std::vector<CBlockHeader>& initial_headers, const arith_uint256&\n+            minimum_required_work, CBlockLocator&& chain_start_locator);\n+\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::optional<CBlockLocator> locator{std::nullopt};\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> headers_to_process;\n+        bool success{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *          Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect.\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.headers_to_process: will be filled in with any headers that the caller\n+     *                       can process and validate now (because these returned\n+     *                       headers are on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.locator: if present, the next locator to send in a\n+     *                       getheaders message\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&",

Perhaps reporting the `nTime` or tracking the median time of the best initial sync block would be nice, then you could report the best one via the gui to give people some idea of progress?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure it makes sense to have the initial header sync phase limited to a single peer?\r\n\r\nAfter adding the above to `getpeerinfo`, and watching a header sync of testnet from scratch, it first did an initial sync up to about block 1M with peer 0, then peer 0 disconnected, and it immediately started an initial header sync with all peers, with peer=8 eventually winning the race and being the one to send all the actual headers.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like a new block being found means I'll receive an INV from all nodes, which will then trigger me sending a GETHEADERS to all nodes, which then gets me doing an initial sync with all nodes anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing some nodes get through initial sync at about twice the speed of others, so seems like it might be a worthwhile speedup even if your first node doesn't decide to disconnect.",

There was a crossing of m_header_sync_mutex and cs_main; GetNodeStateStats is being called while holding cs_main sometimes, and it needs m_header_sync_mutex, which means that elsewhere we cannot grab cs_main while already holding m_header_sync_mutex. There is a commit that fixes this by pushing down the m_header_sync_mutex locking; an alternative was grabbing cs_main for all of the headers sync processing, but the more fine-grained lock approach is cleaner overall, I think.\r\n* Aggregate statistics about (the first phase of) low-work headers sync across all peers in net_processing\r\n* Report those statistics to validation\r\n* Let validation rate-limit those reports, and then use them for logging and emitting signals with progress updates\r\n* Let the GUI use those for reporting as well.\r\n\r\nIn the logs/UI and code related to it I've picked the term \"headers pre-synchronization\" to refer to the first phase of low-work headers sync (as that's a bit of a mouthful). Bikeshedding welcome - but whatever we pick it may be useful to be consistent in naming in other places too.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "@ajtowns I believe you're seeing the effects of the mixing-in-`m_best_header`-based-skipping, but may be misunderstanding what is happening.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, `ValidatedAndStoreRedownloadedHeader` indeed doesn't deal with the peer deciding to continue from one of the mixed-in locator entries, but it doesn't need to; we will, in the same processing of the received headers message, abort the headers sync, and start a new one, with the first header in that received message as starting point. Assuming it is an honest peer, doing so is always advantageous as it means it's skipping some headers sync work with that peer (the locator entries are sorted in such a way that this is the case). Note that while it's possible during INITIAL_DOWNLOAD phase that the actual height of synchronization goes backwards, this may still be advantageous as it means less work to redo during REDOWNLOAD (because while the tip moves backwards, the starting point moves forward).\r\n\r\nThe intention is that once we start synchronizing headers with a peer, we don't ever stop doing so; it up to them to stop giving us headers (by reaching the sync end). We mix in headers from the m_best_header tip to give the peer a chance to skip ahead if there is some part both sides already have, but it is up to them. If there is one peer faster than all others, and in the process of moving ours m_best_header tip forward with every received headers blob, then this means all other peers will continuously be skipping ahead to keep up, but always stay behind this faster peer, until the faster peer reaches the end of the synchronization, at which point all other peers will skip ahead to the end as well, and stop. So in short: while headers sync is ongoing, we will effectively be continuously asking for headers from all headers-syncing peers all the time, until it's done. This is already the case in the current codebase actually, though this PR makes it worse by (a) taking longer overall before synchronization completes even with a single peer and (b) only making progress in synchronization visible to other, slower peers, during the second phase. Some of this downside is mitigated by this mixing in, causing headers sync with other (honest) peers to stop as soon as sync with one peer completes, rather than needing to wait for them to get to the end on their own.\r\n\r\nIt's not impossible to detect certain conditions, like a peer giving us things we're clearly not interested in anymore, to just give up on the synchronization with them, but there are some scary edge cases to think about then. For example, imagine a peer who has a deep reorg of the honest chain (however unlikely that may be, we should be able to deal with it), which forks off more than 2000 headers past the highest previous locator entry in the m_best_header based locators. A newly started header sync at that point will just result in 2000 headers we already have, and aborting the sync entirely and starting over later from m_best_header again will not make any progress towards ever actually getting the peer's chain. For that reason, it seems safer to just keep fetching, and letting the \"skipping\" be done by the remote party - they know best what they're trying to give us.\r\n\r\nThere are two other improvements possible to consider that can reduce bandwidth waste:\r\n* Being more careful about which peers we start synchronizing with, in a controlled way that still results in us eventually trying all peers, so we'll certainly eventually get whatever headers any and all of them have to give us. #25720 is a step in that direction.\r\n* Moving the start point forward: if we receive headers from a peer that we already have, in some cases it is possible to just move the HeadersSyncState m_chain_start point forward (and correspondingly pop off commitments from the buffers in it), so that we restart redownload further ahead when we get there. I have a half-finished commit that does this, but it needs thinking about correctness (again related to this deep reorg scenario above), and adds a bunch of complexity we may not want in this PR.",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** INITIAL_DOWNLOAD means the peer has not yet demonstrated their\n+         * chain has sufficient work */\n+        INITIAL_DOWNLOAD,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect.\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.

      "body" : "> First of all, `ValidatedAndStoreRedownloadedHeader` indeed doesn't deal with the peer deciding to continue from one of the mixed-in locator entries, but it doesn't need to; we will, in the same processing of the received headers message, abort the headers sync, and start a new one, with the first header in that received message as starting point. Assuming it is an honest peer, doing so is always advantageous [...]\r\n\r\nI don't think that's correct. Restarting headers sync pushes you back into initial download, so the behaviour on testnet for a peer that's finished initial sync but skips some blocks during redownload looks like:\r\n\r\n * download 2M headers for initial sync\r\n * download 500k headers for redownload phase\r\n * find that the tip is up to height 550k\r\n * download headers from 550k to 552k that don't connect at 500k, and restart\r\n * find that in the meantime the tip is now up to height 560k, and your faster peer has died\r\n * download 1.44M headers (for blocks at height 560k to 2M) for initial sync\r\n * redownload the 1.44M headers to actually update the tip\r\n\r\nThat is, you've saved downloading 50k headers, at a cost of downloading 1.44M headers in the redundant initial sync. That's not advantageous...\r\n\r\nBeing able to drop another peer from redownload phase back to initial sync seems like it has scary dos opportunities to me, and just searching through the history of the tip that we sent to them seems a very easy way of mitigating the problem in the honest-peer case.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely less important if you're only in the initial sync phase, while some other peer is further along in the redownload phase; you are only getting pushed forward there.\r\n\r\nBut at that point you've already been \"lapped\", and the other peer is demonstrably currently supplying valid headers faster than you. In the normal case there, you're not going to win; and even if you're assuming the other node is an attacker, their attack is just \"delivering valid headers quickly\"... Continuing to try initial headers normally in those circumstances just seems like a waste of bandwidth -- so waiting until the good nodes disconnect or a new block comes in seems like it would be better logic for the non-normal cases.\r\n\r\nI guess at the very least, if that path is normal and expected, then constantly logging it as \"aborted non-connecting // headers sync started\" doesn't seem helpful.\r\n\r\n> It's not impossible to detect certain conditions, like a peer giving us things we're clearly not interested in anymore, to just give up on the synchronization with them, but there are some scary edge cases to think about then. For example, imagine a peer who has a deep reorg of the honest chain (however unlikely that may be, we should be able to deal with it), which forks off more than 2000 headers past the highest previous locator entry in the m_best_header based locators. A newly started header sync at that point will just result in 2000 headers we already have,\r\n\r\nBut we don't consider repeated headers a problem, just ones that don't connect? And if we've already accepted them, they'll connect fine?",

Peer 1 used to be in a state where it would still need to redownload another 1156000-176001=979999 blocks. By restarting at height 666040, it only has to download (1156000-666040) headers (twice, once in commitment, once in redownload phase), or 979920 headers, anymore. It's only a tiny improvement, but it's a strict reduction in the amount of downloading left.\r\n\r\n> peer 1 is just failing due to the if (header.hashPrevBlock != m_redownload_buffer_last_hash) check in ValidateAndStoreRedownloadedHeader.\r\n\r\nI think you're confusing cause and effect. That check is failing because the peer sent us non-continuous headers. And the peer is doing that because we want it to: restarting is less work than continuing.\r\n",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we\n+ * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the\n+ * proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers\n+ * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little\n+ * memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** INITIAL_DOWNLOAD means the peer has not yet demonstrated their\n+         * chain has sufficient work */\n+        INITIAL_DOWNLOAD,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect.\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.

      "body" : "After seeing the discussion between @ajtowns and @sipa regarding bandwidth optimization involving what locators we send and how we process \"skipping ahead\" in our headers download (in the situation where one of our peers is serving us headers at a faster rate than another), I think it makes sense to drop any such optimization from this PR.  Here's my thinking:\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways (such as was done in #25720) to reduce our bandwidth usage during initial headers sync.  While this PR increases bandwidth used by a node starting up for the first time, the overall bandwidth usage is still far below what a new node will end up using during block download, particularly now that #25720 has been merged (mitigating bad behavior that existed prior to this PR).  Further improvements to bandwidth usage are certainly possible, but the set of strategies we might consider for doing so goes beyond the code touched here.\r\n\r\nThat is, while we might consider using tricks with this logic to reduce bandwidth usage -- whether by mixing in hashes from `m_best_header` into the locators we send, and/or using headers that are either received from a peer or accepted into our block index to move a given peer's sync forward -- there are also strategies that may be even more effective that don't involve code changed by this PR.  For example, a refinement to #25720 that further reduces the likelihood of performing initial sync with more than one peer simultaneously (such as by introducing a minimum amount of time that we allow our initial headers-sync peer to complete sync, before we add any other peers, even via the block INV mechanism) would materially affect the impact of optimizations designed to improve the behavior when we have multiple sync peers.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, deploying a p2p protocol change to compress headers message (as has been discussed in the past, such as by omitting prevHash to save 32 bytes, and compressing other fields such as nVersion and nTime) could lead to bandwidth savings of close to 50%, which would eliminate most of the overhead introduced by this PR, at least for upgraded software that supports such a proposed new protocol.\r\n\r\nSo given that we have alternatives like these to consider when thinking about bandwidth usage, and particularly given how complex this PR is already, I think deferring bandwidth minimization strategies to future work makes the most sense.  For now I've removed the optimization that had been in this PR to mix-in locators from `m_best_header`, which I hope makes the logic easier to reason about.\r\n\r\nI've also addressed the latest review feedback from @achow101 and @mzumsande, and incorporated the fixups from @sipa to use the PRESYNC terminology in place of INITIAL_DOWNLOAD.

      "body" : "> After seeing the discussion between @ajtowns and @sipa regarding bandwidth optimization involving what locators we send and how we process \"skipping ahead\" in our headers download (in the situation where one of our peers is serving us headers at a faster rate than another), I think it makes sense to drop any such optimization from this PR. Here's my thinking:\r\n\r\nI think that results in the following observable differences:\r\n\r\n * more bandwidth usage\r\n * if the fastest peer you're syncing with disconnects while in redownload, it will take some time for the next fastest peer to catch up with your best header and you won't be making any progress until then\r\n * previously, once your best header reached min chainwork, you'd start syncing blocks with all nodes; now you'll have to wait until you actually catch up with the tip, or until each peer meets min chainwork independently\r\n\r\nThose don't seem too bad to me. :+1: \r\n\r\n> Alternatively, deploying a p2p protocol change to compress headers message (as has been discussed in the past, such as by omitting prevHash to save 32 bytes, and compressing other fields such as nVersion and nTime)\r\n\r\nFWIW, since BIP320 has been adopted by miners (effectively providing 16 extra nonce bits), I think it's hard to compress nVersion below 2 bytes, and nTime seems to need at least 12 bits; not sure the difference between 3.5 bytes and 8 bytes in the normal case is worth the complexity of dealing with the special cases? Batching headers with a common nBits together would save ~4B per header though, since it only changes every 2016 blocks. (If you did a consensus change to have difficulty change every block, you could still have nBits as a constant value over x,000 blocks describing the minimum allowed difficulty in that period)\r\n\r\n> could lead to bandwidth savings of close to 50%, which would eliminate most of the overhead introduced by this PR, at least for upgraded software that supports such a proposed new protocol.\r\n\r\nUpping the number of headers per message from 2000 to 4000 would halve the number of round-trips necessary (or more? if you increased the message size, 22k headers would fit in a 1MB message at 44B/header, and you'd only need ~35 round trips to sync mainnet instead of ~350...), which I think would cut header sync times down pretty dramatically.",

Arguably we don't strictly need the LocatorEntries() anymore, it could just use GetLocator and grab the innards of the returned locator rather than using LocatorEntries. It doesn't hurt though, it's a bit cleaner I think, and a simpler change later if we want to introduce the header tip mixing again.",

With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,\n+     *                   and has checked that each header satisfies the\n+     *                   proof-of-work target included in the header (but not\n+     *                   necessarily verified that the proof-of-work target is\n+     *                   correct and passes consensus rules).\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.\n+     */\n+    CBlockLocator MakeNextHeadersRequest() const;\n+\n+private:\n+    /** Clear out all download state that might be in progress (freeing any used\n+     * memory), and mark this object as no longer usable.\n+     */\n+    void Finalize();\n+\n+    /**\n+     *  Only called in PRESYNC.\n+     *  Validate the work on the headers we received from the network, and\n+     *  store commitments for later.

Fix this by checking to see if the last header in a headers message is (a) known to us and (b) an ancestor of our best header or tip, and if so, bypass the DoS checks (which doesn't cost us anything because processing these headers wouldn't use more memory anyway).\r\n- This change means that for a node which has synced the honest chain, it's no longer possible for an attacker to try to achieve a collision during REDOWNLOAD by feeding us headers we already have during PRESYNC.  This also means that we would not initiate a low-work headers sync until receiving a headers message that contains something new, which I think is conceptually simpler than what was happening previously.\r\n- I noticed a bug in `ProcessHeadersMessage()` where, in a couple of places, we would be operating on the headers received off the network instead of the headers returned by the headers sync module. The second commit tries to clean this logic up in a less error-prone way by eliminating the `headers_to_process` pointer, in favor of just changing the `headers` vector directly when `previously_downloaded_headers` are returned.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm still contemplating whether any logic change is warranted if we receive a low-work header via compact block (right now we would ignore them, I think this may be fine but since this is a behavior change it's worth considering whether this could be problematic at all).\r\n\r\n(Will squash these commits into place once reviewers have had a chance to take a look)",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,\n+     *                   and has checked that each header satisfies the\n+     *                   proof-of-work target included in the header (but not\n+     *                   necessarily verified that the proof-of-work target is\n+     *                   correct and passes consensus rules).\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.\n+     */\n+    CBlockLocator MakeNextHeadersRequest() const;\n+\n+private:\n+    /** Clear out all download state that might be in progress (freeing any used\n+     * memory), and mark this object as no longer usable.\n+     */\n+    void Finalize();\n+\n+    /**\n+     *  Only called in PRESYNC.\n+     *  Validate the work on the headers we received from the network, and\n+     *  store commitments for later.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,\n+     *                   and has checked that each header satisfies the\n+     *                   proof-of-work target included in the header (but not\n+     *                   necessarily verified that the proof-of-work target is\n+     *                   correct and passes consensus rules).\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.\n+     */\n+    CBlockLocator MakeNextHeadersRequest() const;",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,\n+     *                   and has checked that each header satisfies the\n+     *                   proof-of-work target included in the header (but not\n+     *                   necessarily verified that the proof-of-work target is\n+     *                   correct and passes consensus rules).\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.\n+     */\n+    CBlockLocator MakeNextHeadersRequest() const;\n+\n+private:\n+    /** Clear out all download state that might be in progress (freeing any used\n+     * memory), and mark this object as no longer usable.\n+     */\n+    void Finalize();\n+\n+    /**\n+     *  Only called in PRESYNC.\n+     *  Validate the work on the headers we received from the network, and\n+     *  store commitments for later.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,\n+     *                   and has checked that each header satisfies the\n+     *                   proof-of-work target included in the header (but not\n+     *                   necessarily verified that the proof-of-work target is\n+     *                   correct and passes consensus rules).\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.\n+     */\n+    CBlockLocator MakeNextHeadersRequest() const;\n+\n+private:\n+    /** Clear out all download state that might be in progress (freeing any used\n+     * memory), and mark this object as no longer usable.\n+     */\n+    void Finalize();\n+\n+    /**\n+     *  Only called in PRESYNC.\n+     *  Validate the work on the headers we received from the network, and\n+     *  store commitments for later.

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}",

Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,\n+     *                   and has checked that each header satisfies the\n+     *                   proof-of-work target included in the header (but not\n+     *                   necessarily verified that the proof-of-work target is\n+     *                   correct and passes consensus rules).\n+     * full_headers_message: true if the message was at max capacity,\n+     *                       indicating more headers may be available\n+     * ProcessingResult.pow_validated_headers: will be filled in with any\n+     *                       headers that the caller can fully process and\n+     *                       validate now (because these returned headers are\n+     *                       on a chain with sufficient work)\n+     * ProcessingResult.success: set to false if an error is detected and the sync is\n+     *                       aborted; true otherwise.\n+     * ProcessingResult.request_more: if true, the caller is suggested to call\n+     *                       MakeNextHeadersRequest and send a getheaders message using it.\n+     */\n+    ProcessingResult ProcessNextHeaders(const std::vector<CBlockHeader>&\n+            received_headers, bool full_headers_message);\n+\n+    /** Issue the next GETHEADERS message to our peer.\n+     *\n+     * This will return a locator appropriate for the current sync object, to continue the\n+     * synchronization phase it is in.\n+     */\n+    CBlockLocator MakeNextHeadersRequest() const;",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}",

Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS\n+ * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to\n+ * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need\n+ * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to\n+ * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we\n+ * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for\n+ * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers\n+ * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).\n+ *\n+ * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being\n+ * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain\n+ * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by\n+ * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain\n+ * has sufficient work:\n+ *\n+ * - In the first download phase, called pre-synchronization, we can calculate\n+ * the work on the chain as we go (just by checking the nBits value on each\n+ * header, and validating the proof-of-work).\n+ *\n+ * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is\n+ * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time\n+ * processing them fully, and possibly storing them in memory.\n+ *\n+ * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that\n+ * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of\n+ * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the\n+ * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,\n+ * as follows:\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 1 (presync), store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every\n+ * N headers that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively\n+ * little memory even for a very long chain.\n+ *\n+ * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer and only accept headers\n+ * from that buffer into the block index (permanent memory usage) once they\n+ * have some target number of verified commitments on top of them. With this\n+ * parametrization, we can achieve a given security target for potential\n+ * permanent memory usage, while choosing N to minimize memory use during the\n+ * sync (temporary, per-peer storage).\n+ */\n+\n+class HeadersSyncState {\n+public:\n+    ~HeadersSyncState() {}\n+\n+    enum class State {\n+        /** PRESYNC means the peer has not yet demonstrated their chain has\n+         * sufficient work and we're only building commitments to the chain they\n+         * serve us. */\n+        PRESYNC,\n+        /** REDOWNLOAD means the peer has given us a high-enough-work chain,\n+         * and now we're redownloading the headers we saw before and trying to\n+         * accept them */\n+        REDOWNLOAD,\n+        /** We're done syncing with this peer and can discard any remaining state */\n+        FINAL\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Return the current state of our download */\n+    State GetState() const { return m_download_state; }\n+\n+    /** Construct a HeadersSyncState object representing a headers sync via this\n+     *  download-twice mechanism).\n+     *\n+     * id: node id (for logging)\n+     * consensus_params: parameters needed for difficulty adjustment validation\n+     * chain_start: best known fork point that the peer's headers branch from\n+     * minimum_required_work: amount of chain work required to accept the chain\n+     */\n+    HeadersSyncState(NodeId id, const Consensus::Params& consensus_params,\n+            const CBlockIndex* chain_start, const arith_uint256& minimum_required_work);\n+\n+    /** Result data structure for ProcessNextHeaders. */\n+    struct ProcessingResult {\n+        std::vector<CBlockHeader> pow_validated_headers;\n+        bool success{false};\n+        bool request_more{false};\n+    };\n+\n+    /** Process a batch of headers, once a sync via this mechanism has started\n+     *\n+     * received_headers: headers that were received over the network for processing.\n+     *                   Assumes the caller has already verified the headers connect,",
