   "body" : "This is part of the [assumeutxo project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11) (parent PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606)\r\n\r\nPart two of replacing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232. Since it's dependent on the commits in #25667, I'm opening this as a draft.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen a user activates a snapshot, the serialized UTXO set data is used to create an \"assumed-valid\" chainstate, which becomes active in an attempt to get the node to network tip as quickly as possible. Simultaneously in the background, the already-existing chainstate continues \"conventional\" IBD to both accumulate full block data and serve as a belt-and-suspenders to validate the assumed-valid chainstate.\r\n\r\nOnce the background chainstate's tip reaches the base block of the snapshot used, we set `m_stop_use` on that chainstate and immediately take the hash of its UTXO set; we verify that this matches the assumeutxo value in the source code. Note that while we ultimately want to remove this background chainstate, we don't do so until the following initialization process, when we again check the UTXO set hash of the background chainstate, and if it continues to match, we remove the (now unnecessary) background chainstate, and move the (previously) assumed-valid chainstate into its place. We then reinitialize the chainstate in the normal way.\r\n\r\nAs noted in previous comments, we could do the filesystem operations \"inline\" immediately when the background validation completes, but that's basically just an optimization that saves disk space until the next restart. It didn't strike me as worth the risk of moving chainstate data around on disk during runtime of the node, though maybe my concerns are overblown.\r\n\r\nThe final result of this completion process is a fully-validated chain, where the only evidence that the user synced using assumeutxo is the existence of a `base_blockhash` file in the `chainstate` directory.\r\n",
