Even starting with some rationale from something like [\"Why CMake?\"](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Why%20CMake.html).\r\n\r\n> The plan is to have it in the repo shortly after branching 24.x off, and make CMake-based build system a drop-in replacement of Autotools-based one during the next 2 or 3 release cycles.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK on any approach that has as maintaining multiple build systems over multiple, or even a single release. That will be a maintainability / developer nightmare. If we are going to switch, we should just switch. CMake in, Autotools out, over a short period, ideally just after a branch off, so there is plenty of time for changes to settle and issues to be fixed before the next release.",

A case of seeing if it gets merged in libsecp256k1, seeing if there are any problems with it, contributors getting comfortable with it etc? Or are they entirely separate discussions? i.e. libsecp256k1 could merge in CMake support, it could work fine but it would have no impact on the discussion here? Also would there be opposition to libsecp256k1 maintaining a different build system to this main Core repo or is that a non-issue?",

In Qt 6, we ported the build system to CMake.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that CMake has extensive [support](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-qt.7.html) for Qt, including Qt-specific tools such as MOC, RCC, UIC.\r\n\r\n## Why Qt 6 build system does matter if the Bitcoin Core GUI uses Qt 5?\r\n\r\nFor release builds we use Qt 5.15.5 LTS, the latest Qt 5 version available under a free-software license.\r\n\r\nFor dynamic linking users can use Qt 5.11.3+, which allows them to use packages provided in Debian Buster and Ubuntu Focal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Qt 6 packages are available in the following systems/package managers:\r\n- [Ubuntu Jammy](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/qt6-base-dev)+\r\n- [Debian Bullseye](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye-backports/qt6-base-dev)+\r\n- [Fedora 35](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/qt6-qtbase/qt6-qtbase/)+\r\n- [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qt)\r\n\r\nAs long as Qt GUI is a part of Bitcoin Core, it is inevitable to embrace Qt 6 support, sooner or later.\r\n\r\n## Can we just adjust our current build system to handle Qt 6?\r\n\r\nThe main problem with integration of Qt 6 into the current build system is lacking of pkg-config `*.pc` files for static builds (please note that a patch from [QTBUG-86080](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-86080) works for non-static builds only).\r\n\r\nTo handle Qt 6 with our current build system we need to:\r\n- patch Qt, which looks like a non-trivial task, or\r\n- apply some [nasty hacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24798#discussion_r854001982) to our own build system\r\n- keep in our repo the required `*.pc` files\r\n- check Qt libraries manually\r\n\r\nAll approaches imply maintaining burden for a long time. And last three are pretty ugly :)",

The main difference is a directory structure. While the current Autotools-based build system (AT) supports out-of-source builds, most users make in-source builds. The new CMake-based build system (CM) does not support in-source builds. I consider this as a [benefit](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Getting%20Started.html#directory-structure). As a consequence, there is no `make distclean` in CM.\r\n\r\n2. Most of AT configure options are mapped to CM cache variable, for example:\r\n- `--with-daemon` --> `-DBUILD_DAEMON`\r\n- `--enable-zmq` --> `-DWITH_ZMQ`\r\n\r\n3. Some of AT configure options are implemented as custom [build types](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html?highlight=build%20type#build-configurations) in CM, for example:\r\n- `--enable-hardening` --> `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelHardened`\r\n\r\n4. User provided `CC`, `CXX`, `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS` are supported by CM perfectly out of the box.\r\n\r\n5. Integration with our depends build subsystem has been implemented already:\r\n- `CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/<HOST>/share/config.site` --> `--toolchain depends/<HOST>/share/toolchain.cmake`\r\n\r\n6. With CM users are able to use the same build system natively on a wider range of platforms, e.g., on Windows with MSVC.\r\n\r\n7. With CM the GUI users get Qt 6 support finally :tiger2:\r\n\r\n> Have we achieved feature-parity yet?\r\n\r\nNot in this PR, to [keep](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797#issuecomment-1209449253) it in reviewable state. The full feature-parity is achievable with a couple follow ups.",

No offense, but honestly I think it's more reasonable to consider dropping those platforms than to cater our entire infrastructure to them. I share many of @luke-jr's concerns as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am very open to a feature-complete CMake port of our current build-system for the sake of modernization and future-proofing. But again, that means feature-parity and a focus on the high-priority targets. Sorry, but Qt6 and MSVC just aren't that.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure how to even begin reviewing this without some kind of 1:1 feature completion mapping. Our current build system does a whole lot more than just build binaries and libs.\r\n\r\nFor example, comments like this don't inspire much confidence\r\n\r\n>     I'm assuming that unit-test build support with CMake is still under construction?\r\n> \r\n> It is, but not as a part of this PR. My intention is to keep the latter more or less digestible for reviewers.\r\n\r\nCould you please advise how we can review this without simply testing it on each platform? That approach would likely take years of after-the-fact corner-case fixing. For example, I think it'd be reasonable to set \"autotools/cmake binary output equivalents for all supported platforms, or detailed explanations as to why they differ\" as a pretty obvious requirement for merge. Otherwise we're just kinda hoping for no regressions, no? \r\n\r\nI don't mean to be harsh with the above, I know how much time/effort work like this takes. But I'm afraid this will require some pretty intense planning and arguing to make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: charts and graphs please :)",

      "body" : "Just to explain my concept ACK a little bit: I don't think CMake build needs to add much of a maintenance burden and don't think it needs to have parity with the autotools build. I think if we can start using CMake build for binary releases, then developers can switch to using cmake for all the cool new stuff (qt6, jetbrains, android, web IDEs, rust, bitcoin kernel) and autotools build can hang around in maintenance mode for the old boring stuff.\r\n\r\nI don't think having two build systems should could much trouble for normal developers. Only difference is if you add or renaming a file or flag, you have to may have to make an extra edit.\r\n\r\nI also don't think having two build systems should cause much trouble for people working on build features either, as long as we don't insist on parity between two systems and are clear about which build system is used for binary releases.",

      "body" : "> Just to explain my concept ACK a little bit: I don't think CMake build needs to add much of a maintenance burden and don't think it needs to have parity with the autotools build. I think if we can start using CMake build for binary releases, then developers can switch to using cmake for all the cool new stuff (qt6, jetbrains, android, web IDEs, rust, bitcoin kernel) and autotools build can hang around in maintenance mode for the old boring stuff.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think having two build systems should could much trouble for normal developers. Only difference is if you add or renaming a file or flag, you have to may have to make an extra edit.\r\n> \r\n> I also don't think having two build systems should cause much trouble for people working on build features either, as long as we don't insist on parity between two systems and are clear about which build system is used for binary releases.\r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\nI beg you not to trivialize this way. The buildsystem has major implications for how work is done, namely large refactoring projects like libkernel. Maintaining two build systems may only make one-off PRs a little tougher, but it's guaranteed to significantly impede more interesting (and important) long-term efforts. Given the burnout and long-term developer attrition we've seen lately, that seems exactly backwards prioritization to me. Sure I'm biased towards the big cleanup projects, but at as I said above I think the project would benefit from dropping features and scope rather than adding/expanding. Sure, IDE integration and new platforms and bells and whistles would be nice, but this has whiffs of [Zawinski's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski's_Law) to me.\r\n\r\nCall me a cranky old git, but as much as I'd like a more modern infrastructure, I'm changing/editing my support to a NACK for CMake until it's clear that the implications are better understood by everyone involved/affected. I don't understand the support/concept ACKs that this is receiving when so much of the concept (or even a roadmap) is still absent.\r\n\r\nAnd all that is without even mentioning the new overhead of adding what's essentially a new language that we have no history of reviewing/supporting in this project. Please consider the growing pains.\r\n\r\nI support @hebasto's work here, but I think this PR was opened too early. Personally, I'd suggest taking a step back and making a plan before throwing it up for a committee-style discussion. I'd be happy to take another look at this if/when there's a thoughtful roadmap/feature matrix attached. Until then I'm honestly not sure what we're discussing here so I'll keep out.",

      "body" : "@theuni, I think you not making a clear enough distinction between maintaining a build system, and adding new features to a build system. I can attest to the difference personally. For everyday development, my interaction with autotools is very pleasant. It is very easy to **maintain** makefiles during normal c++ development as flags are switched or files are added and moved around. By contrast, implementing multiprocess support where I was **adding a new build feature** to autotools was a painful process that was very difficult to get right, and even had subtle bugs that were uncovered years after original code was written (#25214).\r\n\r\nI think we both agree that requiring new features to be implemented in two build systems would be a major setback to development. But your solution to that would be to ban use of a build system that would make development easier. My solution would be to choose one build system to use for binary releases, and drop the requirement that the both systems need to have feature parity for other types of development. For development purposes, it's fine to say that we have two build systems, and you are free to use the one your prefer. Build system X supports features A B and C, system Y supports features A B and D. If there is a build feature which your preferred build system is missing, you are welcome to submit a patch.\r\n\r\nI think new IDEs and new development tools tend to use cmake, and tend not use or even support autotools. I think we will make onboarding of new developers more difficult by feverishly clinging to autotools, and make existing developers less productive and code less safe if we can't benefit from using new tools. I also think adding new build features easier using cmake, but obviously this is subjective, and a reason why I think we shouldn't be demanding feature parity.",

Realistically they'll overlap. It's easy to say \"just use CMake for the new stuff\", but for long-lived projects, that unfortunately will mean supporting both (or one awkwardly) during the dev/work/comment/merge periods.\r\n\r\nFor the CMake buildsystem to become supported for release, I would expect that to take no less than 6months to a year. Maybe I'm over-estimating, but that's exactly what I'm trying to flesh out here. When I alluded to the 90%/10% work above, that's what I was getting at. Getting to the point where the binaries build is one milestone, but getting to the point where we have that process fully integrated and we're ready to ship those deterministic/hardened/etc. binaries with all tests passing and happy downstreams is another. It's doable and we SHOULD do it, but it will take time and process and people-power. And during that time, it will be an extra burden for long-lived projects.",

But maybe I've been misrepresenting your \"some stuff here, some stuff there\" approach as well. So maybe we should drill down some.\r\n\r\nI took your approach to mean something like (using a made-up but maybe realistic example): \"CMake builds the release binaries, but autotools continues to handle the c-i for a while\". I think this would be a bad idea. I jumped to that conclusion because @hebasto mentioned hooking up the unit tests in a follow-up PR. I think that would be a very unwise approach.\r\n\r\nHowever, if (once the feature matrix is more built out) we can agree on a set of essentials (I would say release binaries, c-i, everyday dev features, not sure what else), then something like a feature-freeze for autotools and a promise to move over the remaining less critical features (for ex profiling, coverage, etc) over the course of a release cycle.. I could see that as realistic. So I guess that relies on a few things happening:\r\n- a minimum viable set of features being 100% complete, tested, and working with CMake\r\n- a clear direction of feature movement (away from frozen autotools to CMake)\r\n- a plan/promise to move the remaining features\r\n- a sunset plan for autotools\r\n\r\nAgain, the absence of those things here is what leads me to believe that this work is jumping the gun. But instead of grumping, I should've just laid that out. Turns out it took some fighting for that to materialize for me. Thank you for your patience :)",

Looks like we'll need to turn off any flags we don't want enabled by default (like `-Werror`) in the subproject CMake configurations.\r\n\r\nAs the `crc32c` project modifies the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` variable directly, it must be fixed within the project (a bad CMake practice case -- global compiler flags instead of binding them to targets).",

I think that says it all. \r\n\r\nI'll list my arguments that I have not seen in this discussion before:\r\n\r\n- Using interactive configuring with `ccmake` is a breeze, testing this PR with it is very enjoyable\r\n- Modern IDEs have great cmake support and poor autotools support. Many require an additional compilation database for autotools projects\r\n- Out of tree builds are easier to manage\r\n\r\nI am a bit confused about the semantics that distinguish if something is a `module` or a `script` in the `cmake` subdirectory.
