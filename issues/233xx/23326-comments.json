That'd solve the issue of implementation compatibility.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, there are indeed a number of things that need to be decided:\r\n\r\n* How to integrate into descriptors. One possibility is to only support an `agg` fragment as leaf key (e.g. `agg(xpub1/.../*,xpub2/.../*)`), but it's also possible I think to support treating `agg` of xpubs as a new \"xpub\" itself (e.g. `agg(xpub1/...,xpub2/...)/*`) for example by defining the aggregated chaincode as a hash of the child chaincodes. This complicates signing further, however, though I don't think there are fundamental problems with this (I've had some discussions with @jonasnick with this).\r\n\r\n* Signing support feels like it'd be pretty much orthogonal to the descriptors integration. My thinking is that there is no need to restrict it - whatever our descriptors signing logic support will pretty much automatically be supported by MuSig signing code once we have it. `tr()` descriptors right now are very limited (only key path, and `pk(X)` leaves), but if that gets extended, all places that were key expressions are supported in there should also deal fine with MuSig keys.\r\n\r\n* I think you're misunderstanding how the pre-generated nonce variant of MuSig2 works. It isn't sufficient to generate the nonces ahead of time - they also need to be distributed to the co-signers ahead of time (in such a way that they know which nonce is going to be used with which signing attempt, **before** that signing attempt is made). This is both logistically hard (it's essentially incompatible with descriptors, as you can't go and generate/pay to addresses before nonce material has been exchanged), and a huge footgun (all participants need to increment positions in lockstep, make sure never to reuse, need to re-distribute nonces in case of loss of key material; backups are a huge hazard, ...). In my view, this variant is for very specialized applications where latency matters, and you have a well-defined protocol between known-to-be-online co-signers already that it can be integrated into (e.g. I can imagine Lightning using them). In a more \"general purpose\" setting like Bitcoin Core should probably cater to, it feels much safer & saner to stick to the non-interactive setup + 2-round signing version of the protocol.\r\n\r\n* PSBT extensions need to be defined for both rounds (for announcing which public nonces every co-signing is going to use, and for the partial signatures).",

For a simple computer + hardware wallet setup two rounds are no problem; just a matter of calling HWI twice.\r\n\r\nI updated the description to reflect this.",

While that's true on its face, MuSig2 can avoid it too: as the signers need state anyway, and a private key, they can use a counter in their state together with the private key to generate randomness (use H(counter++ || privkey) as RNG).\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages are:\r\n* MuSig-DN is far slower (~1000x) in terms of CPU cost.\r\n* Complicates setup (in addition to participant keys, co-signers also need to know each other's 512-bit host key) compared to 2-round MuSig2 (but 1-round MuSig2 is harder still).\r\n* Implementation complexity (needs arithmetic over two different curves (not secp256k1), needs Bulletproofs or other NIZK proof system, and a relatively complex statement (2030 gates) to prove in it). Also, only very experimental code for MuSig-DN exists; MuSig2 has an implementation that's pretty close to production-ready.\r\n* Additional security assumptions (DDH over two different elliptic curves).\r\n\r\nSo while MuSig-DN is conceptually a nice solution to the problem of having stateful signers (which is definitely annoying, and a risk for unsafe implementations), I don't think the downsides weigh up against it. The additional signing computational cost pretty much puts it pretty out of reach of hardware signing devices, for example. Plus, its only real advantage is a concern about unsafe implementations (which deal incorrectly with signing state) - but it does so by increasing implementation complexity in other ways which also increases risk. With MuSig2, the picture is even less rosy, as the round number advantage is gone too.",

MuSig-DN (or the more efficient scheme in https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1055.pdf) is still more in the academic realm. Technically it does its job but it's hard to use in practice. I think we'll need more research to make deterministic nonces in multisig more efficient and simpler to implement if we want something that fits in Bitcoin Core.  ",

However this is lossy as you will lose the information about the pubkeys that are involved in that aggregated pubkey, and that information is necessary for spending. It will still need to be stored and backed up somewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter talking with @seedhammer  about this a bit, and thinking about it, I came to the following tentative conclusion (after changing my mind about three times :) ):\r\n\r\nMuSig2 aggregation is compatible with BIP32 derivation (that much is not controversial, it's described in the MuSig2 BIP and, well, here), but (claim:) even more specifically, a single participant in the scheme doesn't need to store more than O(1) information, in order to make partial signatures later: instead of storing their private key (call it x_i), they can store x_i_agg = H(L||P_i)x_i (their 'private aggregated key' or whatever we call it), along with the negotiated aggregate public key P_agg. \r\n(Note: i'm specifically saying there that you *don't* store L, the full list of keys).\r\nThen let's say we want to sign on BIP32 (unhardened) branch index j. That participant, i, can (a) calculate the new aggregate pubkey P_agg_j = P_agg + d_j G (where d_j is the BIP32 tweak, publically derivable if unhardened), then calculate their signature share (after following the MuSig2 nonce generation process, note that the factor 'b' only depends on the aggregate key, here P_agg_j), with the formula s_i = k_i_1 + bk_i_2 + H(P_agg_j||R_agg||m)x_i_agg. When these s_i are added, they do not form a full valid signature, but you only need to further add H(P_agg_j||R_agg||m)d_j to make it correct.\r\n\r\nIt's highly likely that that is either (a) already known or (b) wrong in some detail or possibly (c) there is some security issue with doing this [see note]. But I wasn't able to find it written anywhere?\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit off topic here, but more relevant to @seedhammer 's needs, but I believe similar logic applies to FROST (if anything it's a little easier).\r\n\r\n[note] a relevant point of course is that doing unhardened BIP32 with schnorr is only secure because of key-prefixing; ecdsa gets by without it because of non-linearity, but if we didn't use key-prefixing in BIP340 then unhardened i.e. publically derivable tweaks would allow forgery.",
