Worked intermittently but nothing interesting.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoind -shutdownnotify=\"bitcoind\"\r\n\r\nbitcoin-cli stop\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf getting notifications on start and shutdown is the goal maybe we should not provide easy option to execute shell commands with it. A file with name `notifications.dat` that saves such notifications should be enough IMO.",

      "body" : "Thanks, @prayank23 and @shaavan for the review and pointing out the edge case where a user might supply `\"bitcoind\"` as a shutdown notify bash command. \r\n\r\nA solution for that would be to call `.join()` instead `.detach()` in [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23395/files#diff-b1e19192258d83199d8adaa5ac31f067af98f63554bfdd679bd8e8073815e69dR183). This will result in bitcoind completing the entire shutdown sequence only after the bash command has finished executing. In the scenario where `\"bitcoind\"` is supplied as the bash command, the second `\"bitcoind\"` will fail as bitcoind is already running. However, this would also mean that all other bash commands would also be performed synchronously. \r\n\r\nOpen to feedback on how we should handle the scenario when a user supplies `\"bitcoind\"` as a shutdown notify bash command.\r\n\r\n> When I tried to use this argument value myself, there was no output whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf you view `debug.log` you should be able to see if `bitcoind` has successfully restarted by searching for `runCommand error:`",
