This makes sure the source code is C++20 compatible, and perhaps use some C++20 features where possible. It could also be enabled for releases, *if* there is a significant benefit.\r\n\r\nI don't think we want to migrate to have the code _depend_ on C++20 features very soon, as self-compilation on non-cutting-edge systems should remain supported.",

Even if we only want designated initializers, we can't restrict gcc/clang to _only_ permit those, so you could end up in a situation where inadvertently someone introduces a dependency on a C++20 feature that happens to be supported in all compilers used in CI, but not in all compilers we want to support.\r\n\r\nRegarding ranges... yes, but that kind of feature doesn't give us much. Having conditional code that either uses ranges or a fallback, sounds like it'd generally be more complex and error-prone than just not using the ranges interface at all.",
