With this, I'm unable to raise my fd count above the desired ceiling, no matter how hard I hammer.\r\n\r\nPlease have a look here and see what you think: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/http-fd-limit.

      "body" : "@theuni - your patch looks great! I was cautious about modifying so much.\r\n\r\nGiven the discussion, I've reduced my pull request to the simple improvement of making sure to request as many file descriptors as possible.\r\n\r\nWith @theuni's improvement to only accept connections that have data on, honest HTTP connections will go into the connection limiter. However, I suspect adversaries using things like the slowloris attack (which send incomplete requests and then pause) will not be caught and will use resources. These can be controlled if the libevent request is included, but otherwise can be detected but not perfectly controlled using the approach in the first request, which binds to the rather toothless bevcb callback.\r\n\r\nOne way to look at this is that the root issue is that there is a process wide file-descriptor allocation defined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L907 but the RPC interface isn't accounted for. Would be great to integrate @theuni's ConnectionLimiter into that!\r\n\r\nIs it worth defending against slowloris style attacks given the RPC interface is generally not accessible to adversaries?\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, his small change to request as many file-descriptors as possible should help mitigate the original issue on many default configurations (e.g. Ubuntu).",
