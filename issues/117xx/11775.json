   "body" : "This does a few things in a PR, so I'm happy to split it up if people prefer.\r\n\r\na) It clarifies the validationinterface stuff into a mempoolinterface and the validationinterface, splitting the two up into separate systems with the mempool creating events for mempoolinterface and validationinterface functions coming from validation. They are conjoined in the backend to provide ordering guarantees for listeners which are *both* mempool interfaces and validation interfaces, but are otherwise fully separated. There are a few cleanups that are enabled here, which I went ahead and did.\r\n\r\nb) fee estimator becomes a listener to the mempool interface which provides a bit of additional info about transactions being added more than just the tx (eg feerate, etc)\r\n\r\nc) a few minor edge cases in the fee estimator are handled (witness malleation changing feerate, and handling reorgs better, specifically).",
