   "body" : "Add the `override` keyword where applicable on derived classes from `coins.h`.\r\n\r\nUsing the `override` keyword on suitable subclass member functions gives us compile-time assurance that we haven't unknowingly deviated from the signature of base class functions we're trying to override. This avoids situations where calls to \"overridden\" functions on a derived class actually go to the base class implementation due to potentially subtle differences (e.g. `const`-ness of arguments).\r\n\r\nIf others think this is a worthwhile change, I plan on doing this in other applicable regions of the codebase in followup PRs, though I'd be happy to fold all changes into a single PR if that's preferable.",
