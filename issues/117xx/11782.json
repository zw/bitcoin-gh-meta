It also shouldn't impact most future bip 9 (or similar) deployments, as most of those presumably won't need to change the storage format.\r\n\r\nSo I think this might just warrant a cleaner error message rather than handling it properly. Perhaps RewindBlockIndex's test should change from:\r\n\r\n    if (IsWitnessEnabled(pprev) && !BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS && !chainActive) { ... }\r\n\r\nto something like:\r\n\r\n    if (IsWitnessEnabled(pprev)) {\r\n        if (!BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS && !chainActive) {\r\n            ...\r\n        } else if (BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS && pprev->nChainTx == 0) {\r\n            LogPrintf(\"segwit activation height has changed, cannot reuse blockchain\");\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n",
