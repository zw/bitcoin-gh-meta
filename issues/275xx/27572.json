   "body" : "Rather than doing the open/read/hash-steps manually in the affected functional tests, we can just use the `sha256sum_file` helper from the utils module instead.\r\n\r\nNote that for the tool_wallet.py test, the used hash is changed from sha1 to sha256, but as the only purpose is to detect file content changes, this doesn't matter. Also, the optimization using `memoryview` is overkill here, as the opened file has only a size of 24KiB and determining the hash via the helper doesn't take longer than a few hundred micro-seconds on my machine.",
