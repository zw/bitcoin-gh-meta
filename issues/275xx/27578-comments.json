If someone builds something but then needs to convince bitcoin core to allow it to be relayed, then create a patch and get it code reviewed, then finally merged and wait for a release, it will be months to years before their transaction can be relayed. In that amount of time they will have just built a relationship with mining pools and circumvented the mempool completely, and everyone will be worse off for it. And this is happening today! Allowing a flag like this provides a solution so nodes and users can opt into supporting different use cases that haven't yet made it through the process of becoming a standard transaction.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, while running with different policies is not something that we can prevent on the network, we should be mindful that if the prevailing network policy is different than what a use case needs, that the use case will likely not be met anyway without some sort of preferential peering with other nodes running the same policy.

      "body" : "Concept NACK. These checks exist for very good reasons; being able to bypass them on mainnet is a huge footgun. If there is a specific standardness rule that you can show (1) provides little utility to the node or network and (2) is getting in the way of a use case, we can discuss changing that rule.\r\n\r\n> There are many projects today that have part of their workflow \"email a miner this transaction\" (inscriptions, https://github.com/supertestnet/breaker-of-jpegs, etc). This is a problem and will eventually cause a mempool divergence between nodes and miners.\r\n\r\nAllowing nonstandard transactions will not help with this case; you still need to find a miner accepting nonstandard transactions to peer with. You are still \"emailing a miner this transaction,\" just in a more roundabout way.\r\n\r\nLet's say, for example, an application is creating transactions with lots of gigantic, nonstandard outputs that everyone needs to store in their UTXO set. If that application caused the UTXO set to 10x in size, making it less feasible to run a lightweight full node, we would then open an issue to Bitcoin Core asking \"why the hell did you help the network relay those transactions?\" It isn't that the \"process is too slow\" to change the standardness rule. It would just be a terrible idea.\r\n\r\n> Yes, this isn't the 100% perfect solution because there is no perfect solution, but this is an extremely simple change that is a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThis \"simple change\" throws the baby out with the bathwater. The perfect solution is to write applications that don't DoS the network.\r\n\r\n> The problem is that standardness is an overloaded term, it contains some DoS protection while also just disallowing other things. As well, sometimes DoS protection also ends up being the cure that's worse than the disease creating things like transaction pinning.\r\n\r\nAgain can you please point to a specific example that you want to change? Otherwise this PR is just saying \"standardness in general is unnecessary,\" and that is incorrect.",

Seems likely these sources will be paid attention by large mining pools. I'm sympathetic to the motivations behind this change on those grounds, as well as with the general frustration around the sharp edges of policy (e.g. pinning).\r\n\r\nThe notion of having to lobby a council, however qualified, to \"accept a usecase\" is also understandably unappealing at face value. I think the contributors on this project who work on mempool/p2p would argue that the existing standardness/policy helps the project serve its widely understood goal of being a value/payment system rather than a carrier for arbitrary data payloads - but of course the approach towards this goal can become controversial.\r\n\r\nIt is maybe worth clarifying that this change wouldn't really affect pinning either way, since replacement/ancestry-limiting policy isn't governed by the `-acceptnonstdtxn` flag.\r\n\r\nI'm curious to see how the wider scope of this situation unfolds beyond this issue, because there are many good and conflicting lines of thinking. Being choosy about the nature and topology of transactions that this software broadcasts keeps many (most?) users with a functioning node, but it also drives other users to build consensus-compatible alternatives. The mix there can be hard to observe.\r\n\r\nCoexistence of heterogeneous mempools is maybe the steady state.",

If thatâs the case, would it be reasonable to consider removing the 400kb standardness rule (only for taproot transactions)?\r\n\r\nI know for a fact that people are now pushing >400kb txs fairly routinely via out-of-band methods, and I think it wouldâve been healthier to the network if they didnât have to. Iâm not sure whatâs the best place to propose this but happy to look into it if there isnât an obvious reason why this shouldnât be done.",

Otherwise they have to modify and rebuild bitcoin core, and since we know theyâre doing this, perhaps itâs better to provide a flag so they can do so safely.",
