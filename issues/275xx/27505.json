Depending on the platform this can be clunky and a system issue could prevent name resolution from completing at all, blocking the thread and in some cases preventing a clean shutdown.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to switch to the asynchronous `getaddrinfo_a` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4421 but that was reverted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9229 after discovering that function has a segfault!\r\n\r\nTaking BlueMatt's suggestion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10215#issue-221886328, this PR modifies our `g_dns_lookup` function to use `evdns_getaddrinfo()` from [libevent](https://libevent.org/libevent-book/Ref9_dns.html). This is an asynchronous function but I've implemented it in a polling loop so it still blocks -- but now will timeout after 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] We could make the polling loop interruptible but I'm not sure the best approach to that, since these functions don't live in a class with a flag like `interruptNet` \r\n- [ ] Is it possible to add functional tests that mess with DNS? Probably not.\r\n- [ ] The unit test I added makes a live DNS request for `nic.com` that test will fail the platform has no DNS\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- libevent has more low-level DNS functions as well, we could ultimately use those to (for example) request `TXT` records with onion addresses from our DNS seeders\r\n\r\n",
