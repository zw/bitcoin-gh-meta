   "body" : "The ipv4 and ipv6 seeds are updated from sipa's crawler, as outlined in contrib/seeds/README.md. The onion and i2p seeds are pulled from my node's addrman using `getrawaddrman` and then a connection was made to each node to retrieve the current service flags, block height, and user agent string before filtering through makeseeds.py. The CJDNS nodes were not updated as my node is not connected to that network.\r\n\r\nmakeseeds.py is also updated for more recent user agent strings as well as being able to handle i2p addresses.\r\n\r\nAlso updated the testnet seeds.",
