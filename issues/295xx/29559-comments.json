So it sounds like the `bitcoin-wallet info` and `bitcoin-wallet dump` calls could check if the file is read-only _and_ the format it BDB, and then exit.\r\n\r\nThat then leaves the complexity of handling unexpected errors with sqlite wallets. Especially for the the `dump` call a silent failure would be very dangerous, if somehow you can end up with an incomplete dump. Though as long as you end up with _no_ dump it's fine.\r\n\r\n@BebeSparkelSparkel:\r\n\r\n> but do not know c++ well enough to diagnose where sqlite is requiring write permissions.\r\n\r\nIn that case this might not be the best issue to tackle for now. Not that our c++ usage is very advanced, but the wallet codebase is complicated and requires some familiarity.\r\n\r\n(but to be clear: you don't need permission to try anyway!)",
