Adversary connects to Bitcoin\r\n2. Stays connected to bitcoin forever.\r\n\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n25\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nubuntu\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
