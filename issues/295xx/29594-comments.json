Knowing \"spent\" for certain would require querying whether the UTXO existed at some point in the past...\r\n\r\n> I would like to fine grain error which informs whether the input is actually spent or if it is an orphan tx. I have logic that wants to do different things whether the parent is confirmed or not.\r\n\r\nNot sure if I'm misunderstanding the situation, but a few ideas\r\n\r\n- `gettxspendingprevout` tells you if something has a mempool conflict\r\n- If something is confirmed and bitcoind sees one of its outputs in the UTXO set (\"txn-already-known\" means \"this tx already confirmed\" if you want to try looking for that error).\r\n- The wallet has logic to see if its transactions have been conflicted by a block (see \"confirmations\" in rpc results).\r\n- Consider just resending the parent always? If it's missing, problem solved. If it's in mempool already, no harm done. If it's confirmed and has an output available, \"txn-already-known\". If it conflicts with something, \"bad-txns-inputs-missingorspent\".",
