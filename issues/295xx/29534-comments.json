We added a new feature [`$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing`](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/learn/experimental-features#psnativecommandargumentpassing) to control how PowerShell passes arguments to native commands. The default behavior for Windows and Linux/macOS should work as most users expect in their respective environments.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr:** Empty strings are preserved as arguments now.\r\n\r\nThe CI was broken due to the PowerShell [upgrade](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/9115) from 7.2.18 to 7.4.1.",
