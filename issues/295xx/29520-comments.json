Given the high fees, this policy is incentive-incompatible to adopt as a miner. Even if this relay policy is adopted, this has not stopped ordinals in the past (4MB tx [in mempool.space](https://mempool.space/tx/0301e0480b374b32851a9462db29dc19fe830a7f7d7a88b81612b9d42099c0ae), [in ordiscan](https://ordiscan.com/inscription/652), as [tweeted](https://x.com/udiWertheimer/status/1621176136142045191?s=20)).\r\n    This change is likely harmful to the node by making its mempool exclude transactions that will be mined. This is a restriction to default policy, which can impact many users beyond an individual node operator, including making it difficult for people to access existing funds, and disrupting compact block relay.\r\n    This will not prevent data-carrying transactions. See above. It may be best to leave the methods that are most efficient wrt network resource costs.\r\n    People are calling this \"spam\" because they don't like ordinals. While I also personally think Bitcoin is best used for financial transactions, I disagree with this framing of \"spam.\" In transaction validation and relay logic, we should define spam on the basis of network resources consumed and whether those costs are well bounded and/or paid for, not on the basis of use case. We have no way of detecting whether a bunch of bytes are real/legitimate/useful and, even if we could, it is not protocol development's place to decide which use cases of Bitcoin are legitimate and which ones aren't.",

Core has to make decisions on its default policy and what policy options are available. Other implementations (e.g. Knots) are free to make different decisions. Node runners are free to run a different implementation if their policy preferences aren't facilitated in Core. The difference between Core and Ocean/Knots is that Core moves slower, would lose this game of whack-a-mole (to the extent that winning is even possible) and would look ridiculous in the process. I don't think Core should engage in this game regardless of whether we are talking default policy or custom policy options. Having a bunch of pointless policy options 5 years down the line that were only introduced to play this game of whack-a-mole is not a good direction for the project or the software.\r\n\r\nThat is my view and hence why I'm Concept NACKing this PR and new PRs that crop up with a similar objective. In the spirit of not wanting to create unnecessary noise in this repo I won't be commenting on this PR again but I will log my Concept NACK on new PRs with a similar objective.\r\n\r\n",
