   "body" : "Since in theory a quantum computer can be much more efficient in mining, it is necessary to protect the blockchain from possible rewriting of transaction history. I would prohibit nodes from switching to a longer chain of transactions if it differs by more than one week, i.e. 1008 blocks, i.e. consider new blocks with a difference of 1008 blocks from the last found to be invalid. This will protect the network from this theoretical attack\r\n",
