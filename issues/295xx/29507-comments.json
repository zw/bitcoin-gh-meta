I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\n- Who is currently banned\r\n- What specific reasons they were banned for, with links to relevant issues or comments\r\n- When the ban will end\r\n- Who made the decision to ban them\r\n\r\nI think it would be good if bans were fairly short, starting at a few days and not lasting more than a few months.\r\n\r\nI think this could be a good approach because a ban does not need to imply that anyone has done something wrong or immoral, it could just be a tool for allowing overheated discussions to cool off.",

In this regard, the Linux kernel's code of conduct could serve as an exemplary model. Given the anticipated expansion of Bitcoin Core, especially in terms of contributor numbers, it could soon rival the scale of the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I have concerns about potential misuse of this tool that must be addressed. Specifically, the issues already highlighted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890 raise valid points regarding how the code of conduct could be exploited to sow discord within the community and incite unnecessary conflicts. It is imperative that measures are put in place to prevent such outcomes, however I'm unsure of how that could be achieved. I guess that having a code of conduct, in the context of Bitcoin Core, might paradoxically serve as a double-edged sword, obtaining the opposite result of what is intended if not properly used.",

They all really just outline the kind of space that they want to foster for their respective projects, some pointers on how to achieve that, and some things to not do. I think they're fairly loose and don't really prescribe how people must actually behave nor necessarily exact things that would be violations or specific consequences for doing so. Rather, they do seem to all just state that they want their communities to be welcoming and respectful, and if anyone feels like that is being violated, they can report a CoC violation.\r\n\r\n> I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\nSure, but the question has always been what behaviors do contributors think are ban worthy, and the lack of any guidelines for that is what brings up this issue.\r\n\r\n> maybe we could consider opening a new repository like bitcoin-core/moderation or bitcoin-core/gh to track issues like this related to moderation, or management of the github org.\r\n\r\nI agree with having these kinds of issues be in a separate place. I think the Discussions feature could be used for this as well.\r\n\r\n> For what it's worth, I think it will be extremely difficult to prevent the weaponization of the loose language, including the requirement to accept veiled criticism and encouraging weaponized demands for apologies.\r\n\r\nIIRC this is a criticism of the specific text proposed in the previous PR, but the point of this one is not to propose a specific text yet. It's not clear to me how the examples I've linked to would require accepting veiled criticism or encourage weaponized demands for apologies, so I think this problem can be avoided by using different language.\r\n\r\n> See also http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this is open source and no one is obligated to work with you. You could be a genius super coder, but be a complete asshole that is hard to work with, and it is everyone's right to decide to never speak with you. Being good at something doesn't give you the right to force everyone to listen to you.\r\n\r\n[Well-kept Gardens Die By Pacifism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tscc3e5eujrsEeFN4/well-kept-gardens-die-by-pacifism) and I certainly think we're well on the road to death considering how little moderation occurs in this repo and the IRC channel. We can even see from the [2023's contributor survey results](https://adamjonas.com/bitcoin/coredev/retro/coredev-2023-retro/) that the number of contributors has been steadily decreasing and that disruption from both contributors and non-contributors have been a major frustration in the past couple years. I do not want to suggest that there is evidence for a direct causal link between lacking moderation and fewer contributors, but it's not so much a stretch to say that this may be a factor, among many others. More active moderation and a guidelines for that moderation (whether that be a code of conduct or something else) seems like proper way to resolve these issues.",

      "body" : "> As such, I think it would be prudent for us to reconsider adding a Code of Conduct or otherwise some written rules of moderation so that moderation actions can be taken more proactively.\r\n\r\nLike I said [last time](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890#issuecomment-1382673362), I think more proactive moderation is a good idea, but adding a code of conduct will likely cause more problems than it solves. Moderation is naturally a judgement call, and either people support the people making those judgement calls or they don't. Trying to specify what's good behaviour just encourages lawyer-style parsing of the terms, and if you're just talking in generalities like \"be excellent to each other\" you're not really providing any help to the people who might actually want some help.\r\n\r\nIf mods/others want to write some \"how to constructively engage with other contributors\" advice (like productivity.md or developer-notes.md) that's likely fine, and allows for a positive focus on good behaviour rather than a negative one on the worst contributors. (\"oops, I got moderated, how should I react?\" might be a good question to have an answer for, for people who're trying to be constructive, but don't always succeed, and are afraid that more proactive moderation might cause them to be exiled/excommunicated)\r\n\r\nIf repo admins/mods want to have a private wiki page with some bullet points for what should be moderated and what shouldn't so they can be consistent with each other, especially in the early days of being more proactive, that probably also makes sense. (Trying to coordinate a response to attackers while being completely transparent in all your plans on how you'll respond seems like a losing bet to me, so beyond [ryanofsky's suggestions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1970112884) about making it possible to audit the actual actions taken, I think there are limits on how much transparency is a good thing)\r\n\r\n(To be explicit: I don't support adding a code of conduct, however I do support the current repo admins being more proactive in moderating comments, even if they insist on making a code of conduct as part of doing so)",

You can't write a set of rules or an algorithm to determine what is rambling or off-topic. It will be totally dependent on the PR and the proposed change. Stop wasting time, be proactive and transparent with your moderation decisions and certainly don't start blocking people for weeks or months. That is another terrible rabbit hole to go down. GitHub allows you to mark a comment as abuse or off-topic as you have done on this issue. It also allows anyone to view the comments that you have marked as abuse or off-topic. Use the tools available to you and stop trying to become a subpar lawyer. You're not a Core maintainer because of your legal expertise.",

Either there's a formal process that's (hopefully) somewhat transparent to deal with disruptive people or there isn't and there's only frustration from being ignored and banned and muted by individuals and the same conversations happen in back rooms instead. There's not going to be a material change in outcome for a CoC done right (though it can definitely be done wrong), there's only more transparency and formalism.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience of the LDK code of conduct, @TheBlueMatt is the perfect example of someone who does not understand how âconflict of interestsâ apply to moderators too. For everyone transparency, my access to LDK is blocked since I raised strong observations on Matt's development style [here](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2620#discussion_r1341872253). If youâre tired to have people pointing flaws in your code and youâre under pressure of your own employer to respect _commercial deadlines_ this is _so easy_ to masquerade this as a Code of Conduct infringement. \r\n\r\n> At the same time, this is open source and no one is obligated to work with you. You could be a genius super coder, but be a complete asshole that is hard to work with, and it is everyone's right to decide to never speak with you. Being good at something doesn't give you the right to force everyone to listen to you.\r\n\r\n@achow101 If youâre not able to bear with the current pressure of being a maintainer you can resign from your admin rights or open the discussion to have more people vetted with spam management rights if the task is too much demanding. Blocking someone GH account wonât prevent to have _sound_ technical arguments address on another communication interface in an automatic fashion.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a discussion better to be held at one of the next Coredev editions, or with wide consensus ecosystem.",

OpenAI board firing Sam Altman is an example of a formal, legalized process that had no transparency about the reason he was fired.\r\n\r\nI feel strongly that any moderation process should be transparent, but I don't really care how formal it is. For example if the moderation process will involve bans, I think it needs to be clear at all times who is banned, when they will be unbanned, what specific reasons they were banned, and who decided to ban them. I don't think there needs to be a very formal process for deciding to ban someone for a week, but more formality could be helpful in other cases.\r\n\r\n@ariard I just want to say I agree with your general complaints, and I don't really know the details, but would probably also agree you were also treated unfairly in some cases in the past. However, I don't think it's helpful to call out people individually and speculate about their motivations in this issue. I really think everybody here has good intentions, and if people acted badly it probably had more to do with interpersonal conflicts and emotions running high, and hopefully there can be less of those things if we try to stick more narrowly to the topics being discussed.",

      "body" : "@ryanofsky Thanks for your words, I very appreciate. About the past cases, Iâll for sure keep addressing people with whom I have an opened concern over adequate communication channels. However, note the original subject of dispute was already being in a non-solved situation of conflict of interests with the lack of a neutral tier, apart of already established court of justice, whatever the jurisdiction (which Iâm fine with).\r\n\r\nI donât pretend to be exempt of conflict of interests myself. Just historically being far more frank with my discussion partners and being _very sensible_ about them (e.g refusing to accept financial resources to work on consensus changes whatever for-profit or non-profit) and be proactive in private when it arises.\r\n\r\nFor your own information, âgood intentionsâ have been debunked philosophically numerous times e.g by Max Weber, better to talk about communication process constraining the participants in good faith. That said, Iâll assign âgood intentionsâ to anyone engaging in a conversation as long as theyâre _opened_ to have a patient conversation (without threats of preemptive ban or whatever).\r\n\r\nPersonally, if weâre seeing another âforcing throughâ of moderation rules adoption, like Iâve been the witness with LDK, Iâll revise my security information sharing policy in consequence. At the stricto sensu excluding anyone being a moderator even if theyâre on the security list or already a `trusted-keys`.\r\n\r\nWhile Iâm very open to take time and discuss the establishment of new moderation rules to guarantee minimal civility, I have no sincere wish to collaborate with folks playing a âking-and-presidentâ culture, and jeopardizing a safety-first culture.\r\n\r\nI wonât comment further on this issue. I think the discussion should be handled on the mailing list, a communication space where any current conversation protagonist does not have vetted interest in the discussion, neither is able to unilaterally decide what is âoff-topicâ from not in a very already arbitrary fashion (cc. @achow101 or anyone who has marked one my previous comment as âoff-topicâ, do you have âFOSS independenceâ provisions in your work contract like few Blockstream veterans used to have ?).\r\n\r\n_Key lesson_: I think whatever the moderation rules and process adopted we should have a **distinct** group of moderators i.e people not being maintainers, not vetted with current GH admin rights, not being on a security list or being an emeritus security researcher like myself in the purpose to minimize future situation of conflict of interests. We can take time to go select the adequate group of people.\r\n\r\nInviting anyone to pursue the discussion on the new google group (I started one though feel free to start another one if you donât like the communication tone), itâs more appropriate.",

      "body" : "One way of thinking about this issue is maintainers seeking feedback on the current process for moderation. The recent Core dev [survey](https://adamjonas.com/bitcoin/coredev/retro/coredev-2023-retro/) showed that the number 1 frustration of developers is the brigading/campaigning comments from outside the org. Very recently I've received (and made) various requests for more moderation. Up until that point, pretty much 100% of the feedback (at least from my perspective) was \"you're making things worse,\" \"you are censoring,\" \"you are acting against bitcoin's values and should step down,\" etc. As I mentioned previously, when moderation doesn't happen, it's because people are worried about acting against the group's wishes.\r\n\r\nImo this issue has been productive for feedback collection. My takeaways are:\r\n\r\n- Be more proactive https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1974690560\r\n- Don't want a formal process, but do want a more transparent one https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1975690933\r\n- Avoid \"conflict of interest,\" separate the moderation team from the maintainer team https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1977201037\r\n- A formal public CoC may just be weaponized to DoS moderators while still allowing undesirable behavior.

      "body" : "As a non-moderator reviewer I find brigading and campaigning comments annoying, but easy to ignore. However I do think they reduce review quality overall, and thus code quality. That's made worse if the original author is discouraged from improving their code.\r\n\r\nModeration may have the advantage of _showing_ that person that they're being ignored, which is especially helpful if they had good intentions. That may be what @TheBlueMatt was getting at? https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1972166342\r\n\r\nMy two main concerns with \"code of conduct\" are:\r\n1. the risk of getting drawn into culture wars stuff\r\n2. controversial or unsafe stuff getting merged, without a \"paper trail\" of objections\r\n\r\nI think my suggestion from last year https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890#issuecomment-1382310637 should help mitigate (1):\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a better approach is to start with an extremely small document that simply list things you shouldn't do and potential consequences: don't spam, don't go off topic, no ad homonyms, etc. Expand that list as new bad things happen, rather than trying to preempt every contingency.\r\n\r\n(in the context of avoiding \"fluffy\" language that is more likely to be seen as political)\r\n\r\nBut as the description says:\r\n\r\n>  Instead of proposing a specific text this time around, I've opted to first revisit the idea on its own, and we can try to nail down the text at a later date. \r\n\r\nSo we can do that.\r\n\r\nAnd I also see how such rules can be used to endlessly \"litigate\" the meaning of these terms. Which is an argument in favor of allowing moderators to use their own judgement - but that's risky too.\r\n\r\nRegarding (2):\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's enough volunteers around to completely separate moderators from `trusted-keys` people. It does seem like a good standard to strive for.\r\n\r\nA good start would be that if moderator A is closely involved with (the topic of) a heated discussion, they ping moderator B to do the ban. That way at least there's two eyes on it. Combined with a published list of bans.\r\n\r\nI also wrote this:\r\n\r\n> I'd rather not ship a zero-day because a mean person couldn't point it out. On the other hand [...]\r\n\r\nSo one guideline I would suggest is to delay merging stuff if a potential competent reviewer is on a ban list (probably can't be a hard rule, because that would be DoS vector on the process).\r\n\r\n> If mods/others want to write some \"how to constructively engage with other contributors\" advice (like productivity.md or developer-notes.md) that's likely fine, and allows for a positive focus on good behaviour rather than a negative one on the worst contributors. (\"oops, I got moderated, how should I react?\" might be a good question to have an answer for, for people who're trying to be constructive, but don't always succeed, and are afraid that more proactive moderation might cause them to be exiled/excommunicated)\r\n\r\nYes, that seems useful content. But as I mentioned in my meta-comment last yet, it should _not_ be in the codebase: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890#issuecomment-1382310637 (but e.g. on a wiki)",

And unfortunately Github's mechanism for allowing one user to \"block\" another seems to be too heavy-handed for use in our repo, as it can be used to prevent people from reviewing and commenting on PRs, which seems inappropriate for this project.\r\n\r\nSo in the absence of better tooling to help contributors ignore inappropriate content and harassment by others, I think moderation is our only real option. I don't feel strongly about whether we have an explicit code of conduct, or if we find some other way to empower moderators to use their judgment to cut down on off-topic posts, brigading, ad-hominem attacks, and the like, but broadly speaking, I'm supportive of us moving in this direction so that we can keep this place productive in a way that is consistent with the ethos of open-source development.",

Pick people who are reasonable and rational but also engineers who, above all else, want to be able to focus on getting work done. No matter what the Code of Conduct says in textual form, people who want to create dramaz and inject culture war into anywhere they go will do so, if they end up in the set of people who control the ban button (whether that's a code of conduct committee or repo admins) they'll create dramaz you don't want.\r\n\r\n> controversial or unsafe stuff getting merged, without a \"paper trail\" of objections\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a major issue for *consensus* changes, but I don't see how its super relevant for day-to-day Bitcoin Core contributions and PRs. There's nothing wrong with a controversial PR getting merged in the wallet or GUI or even P2P (as long as they aren't unsafe). We obviously want every competent person to contribute to Bitcoin Core, but if someone's net contribution is to distract others from doing their work (no matter how they do that) more than they actually add, then we can live without them. There's simply no excuse for keeping people around who, net, result in less productivity and focus, just because they might raise some legitimate issues in the future. You also have to consider the people who are being distracted are also likely to point out some other issues elsewhere, and aren't able to because they're being distracted!",

I did a second one more polite and civil, as such being able to collect open feedback from the wider Bitcoin community.\r\n\r\nAdding few more thoughts here as I cannot express myself on the google group mailing list for now.\r\n\r\n> The best defense against this is having a code of conduct committee that absolutely despises spending time on a code of conduct committee. Pick people who are reasonable and rational but also engineers who, above all else, want to be able to focus on getting work done. No matter what the Code of Conduct says in textual form, people who want to create dramaz and inject culture war into anywhere they go will do so, if they end up in the set of people who control the ban button (whether that's a code of conduct committee or repo admins) they'll create dramaz you don't want.\r\n\r\nI think itâs wise to pick up moderators who are contributors to Bitcoin Core, or the wider Bitcoin community. Not only technical contributors, we can pick up people with a substantial track record organizing local Bitcoin meetups or conferences.\r\n\r\nOn the call to _just_ apply \"reasonable and rational\" norms this is one of the more discussed subject in philosophy (cf. [Gaston Bachelard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Bachelard) on the history of epistemology).\r\n\r\nIt sounds to me there is an ignorance of the [underlying political ideology](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/) already behind the notion of a âcode of conductâ, even as practiced by other major listed FOSS projects. Itâs already a practice standing for _social justice warriorism_, politely. What can be _drama_ in the eyes of one contributor can be a very justified topic of discussion in the eyes of another contributor.\r\n\r\nAs a simple objective fact, to the best of my knowledge we have already 3 maintainers (glozow, russ, achow) who are US-college educated. Without this being a criticism of US-education (I would bet I know a better deal about US history than the average US-college graduate), I think it would be very fruitful to have moderators coming from a different cultural and geographical background.\r\n\r\nE.g in my local culture itâs an accepted fact to go to reach out to journalist when you think someone in a public position of authority is adopting a misappropriate sequence of actions in the conduct of its public role.\r\n\r\n> This sounds like a major issue for consensus changes, but I don't see how its super relevant for day-to-day Bitcoin Core contributions and PRs. There's nothing wrong with a controversial PR getting merged in the wallet or GUI or even P2P (as long as they aren't unsafe). We obviously want every competent person to contribute to Bitcoin Core, but if someone's net contribution is to distract others from doing their work (no matter how they do that) more than they actually add, then we can live without them. There's simply no excuse for keeping people around who, net, result in less productivity and focus, just because they might raise some legitimate issues in the future. You also have to consider the people who are being distracted are also likely to point out some other issues elsewhere, and aren't able to because they're being distracted!\r\n\r\nGiven how much you can have interactions among consensus rules between the wallet and the P2P and their given deployment market shares, conversations in those areas are as much significant in term of funds at risk than other areas. Personally, I donât think contributors whatever their level of competence or legendary track records are legitimate to justify whatever level of moderations to accommodate their _subjective_ appreciation of being harassed (if theyâre working for a well-funded entity they can ask for additional psychological support as part of their compensation, they do that at Google and Facebook I think ?). As a security researcher, I have sadly experience with âbad faithâ software vendors.\r\n\r\nAs itâs said in [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/code-of-conduct/) community guidelines: \"we are most definitely thankful and appreciative of your efforts, but must also remain vigilant in order to ensure continued quality and safeguard against potential sabotage.\"\r\n\r\nOn some more constructive and proposed points:\r\n- make the moderation discussed in _public_ and moderation decisions _authenticated_ by default (e.g OTS or GPG-signed)\r\n- introduce the ability to appeal or recall any ban, at least if they start to be substantial\r\n- have moderators coming from a wide social, bitcoin and geographical background\r\n- have moderators nominated for a time-bounded period e.g as done by the Linux kernel project (2 years iirc)\r\n- train moderators in term of public internet discussion standards, e.g have them read a list of classics of FOSS culture\r\n\r\nFinally, I think we can automate a lot of pure spam management (e.g anonymous chat-gpt PRs) to make the âbear-loadâ already encumbered by maintainers more acceptable. Looking into the hoods of Github API right now, we can discuss this topic on another issue.",

      "body" : "> One way of thinking about this issue is maintainers seeking feedback on the current process for moderation.\r\n\r\nYou might consider phrasing that as \"Moderation Guidelines\" or similar rather than a Code of Conduct -- ie something that talks about how moderators will behave, rather than how everyone will. Having \"guidelines\" rather than \"policy\" or \"rules\" might help that be a living document, and minimise the amount of legalistic nitpicking based on it (and having it be authored by the people it affects might make it feel like less of an imposition on contributors). If it were up to me (and it's not!), I'd do something like this:\r\n\r\n * setup a \"Mod Guidelines\" page somewhere, maybe in the devwiki. limit edits to org members, and say on the page that only mods should edit it\r\n   * state what the goals are for moderation: presumably we want PRs/issues/reviews/comments to be friendly, professional, and focussed on technical issues, but probably the \"bitcoin is money for enemies\" philosophy and the desire to accept contributions from anons limits how effective moderation can be in practice; probably technical limitations about how github works also limits things\r\n   * state what tools you've got: hide comments, limit PRs/issues to org members, block users, (...?) and give an idea when they're expected to be used, mostly so mods can be consistent but also so contributors know what to expect\r\n   * give some advice on how to react to being moderated. main points are probably:\r\n     * \"take a step back and calm down, this isn't permanent, and isn't going on your permanent record\"\r\n     * \"generally, escalation will only make things worse\"\r\n     * \"if you're sincerely confused, you can ask for more of an explanation; but expect that to be an explanation of what you did wrong, not a sudden realisation from the moderators that you were right all along. arguing with the ref is how you turn a yellow card into a red card\"\r\n * pass that text around to regular contributors and ask them if they're comfortable endorsing it; revise it until you've got something that does seem widely supported\r\n * setup somewhere that collects logs of moderation actions, possibly only viewable by mods or by org members\r\n * setup somewhere for contributors (not necessarily org members) to give feedback about moderation (maybe the irc channel and the annual survey are good enough)\r\n\r\n> The recent Core dev [survey](https://adamjonas.com/bitcoin/coredev/retro/coredev-2023-retro/) showed that the number 1 frustration of developers is the brigading/campaigning comments from outside the org. Very recently I've received (and made) various requests for more moderation. Up until that point, pretty much 100% of the feedback (at least from my perspective) was \"you're making things worse,\" \"you are censoring,\" \"you are acting against bitcoin's values and should step down,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI think that's to be expected tbh -- when moderation is working well, the only people that really notice are the ones being moderated, and they'll complain; and when you add in people with significant financial motivation to see the project either fail or make little progress (eg, so that their altcoins can compete, or so that they can get control over bitcoin's future for themselves) then I think attacks on the development process and maintainers even when things are working fine is also to be expected. If those sorts of attacks are seen to be effective at slowing the project down or pushing existing devs out, I'd expect more of them. YMMV, of course.",

      "body" : "> setup somewhere that collects logs of moderation actions, possibly only viewable by mods or by org members\r\n\r\nI think this overall âMod guidelinesâ proposal is reasonable and actually wise to precise how the moderators should behave, rather than everyone will. One divergence, I strongly believe that all the moderation process should happen in _public_ (e.g on a dedicated irc channel), including the logs of moderation actions. I donât see any technical or philosophical reason why this should happen in private ? Publicity of moderation allows anyone to verify moderation decisions are generally following the guidelines. If you have a private inter-personal issue, I think itâs better left to existent conflict resolution mechanisms or other new ones.\r\n\r\nI still very think âmoderatorsâ selection should be a careful process. We can afford to select people who are not necessarily highly technical contributors though yet with a past track records of bitcoin contributions. I think it can be judicious to pick up e.g regular meetups organizers or operational people at bitcoin orgs outside of the circle of maintainers and proficient reviewers. They might have more _time_ to investigate and take a _listening-first_ and grounded moderation decision and they will be certainly more _neutral_ w.r.t to any technical discussion (I donât think itâs _fair_ practice if you have a moderator moderating on its own PR ?). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think itâs good to rotate moderators every X and have them elected by the regular technical contributors (this is done by Linux kernel where every contributors with more than Y commits over the last N releases can participate in the vote). Someone could be re-elected through election acts as a check-and-balance, and avoid any _unaccountable_ and _opaque_ bureaucracy phenomena.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think itâs good if the âModeration guidelinesâ offers some public or personal apologies (e.g âsorry for the heated conversation, I owe you a beer next timeâ) mechanism for offenders to recall the ban. It can happen to be âroughâ towards someone in the flux of online events, weâre human beings we all have highs and lows. I hope weâll design âMod guidelinesâ that are cultivating community appeasement and communication reestablishment, over narrow \"blame cultureâ.",

Mostly, it's justifying the necessity of putting barriers in online discussion by taking example from the meatspace academics world then go to jump at the end to say it's okay for online communities moderators to listen to their emotional impulsions when to decide when to apply censorship.\r\n\r\nOn the academic world, it's very true there is a lot of barriers and check-and-balances to guarantee high-quality of the discussion. E.g all major university systems are selecting their participants based on their GPA records or one-time exam like baccalaureat result. And indeed taking speechs on public subject inside a university most of the time you have to be member of an association or fraternity, which have themselves their own selection criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever it forgets a lot of crucial points of the academics world, the \"opinion moderators\" (i.e the university professors)\r\nare going through a long list of initial exams to guarantee diversity and richness of their viewpoints (PhD / post-doc / threshold of academic paper citations / \"aggregation\" rituals). They are also guarantee life-long job tenures in most systems, motivated to avoid temporary pressure from the crowd in the filtering of ideas and who is allowed to speak.\r\n\r\nAll their act of moderations are constantly evaluated and re-evaluated by their academic peers in an open fashion. Moderators or administrators accused of plagiarism can very easy seen their careers jeopardized as one Harvard president recently learnt it.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's ignoring the [\"Trused Party Are Security Holes\"](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/trusted-third-parties) philosophy which in my opinion not only underpinning the Bitcoin ecosystem though also ignoring the traditional critics of the \"masters\" or \"moderators\" living in academics life (e.g see George's Steiner [Lessons of the Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lessons_of_the_Masters)).\r\n\r\nOverall, Eliezer Yudkowsky's piece sounds to me inaccurate as it's more an empty justification of the pure arbitrary\r\nof an online moderator capabilities usage rather than giving example of concrete mechanism that an online community can put in place to guarantee it stays intellectually lively or lines of code productive.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAfter looking more on Github API and its architecture, I think it will cost someone with domain expertise like myself 100$ / month in terms of domain names and infrastructure to permanently nuke any GH-based moderation decision. \r\n\r\nIâll check this line of research rather than keep commenting on establishing a moderation process that might not be technically plausible to follow.",

Having \"guidelines\" rather than \"policy\" or \"rules\" might help that be a living document, and minimise the amount of legalistic nitpicking based on it (and having it be authored by the people it affects might make it feel like less of an imposition on contributors).\r\n\r\nThat is essentially what I imagine. It's really just the need for an established set of rules at all, whether it's called a \"Code of Conduct\" or \"Moderation Guidelines\", I don't think it particularly matters.\r\n\r\n> we should have a distinct group of moderators i.e people not being maintainers, not vetted with current GH admin rights, not being on a security list or being an emeritus security researcher like myself in the purpose to minimize future situation of conflict of interests. We can take time to go select the adequate group of people.\r\n\r\nIndeed, and I would, in fact, prefer that. Frankly, I really don't want to be spending my time on moderation and only do so because there are few others with the requisite github permissions to do so. If we establish a group of moderators who can take over that duty, that'd be great.\r\n\r\nI do want to mention however that the repo does actually get a ton of spam, and there are hundreds of currently blocked users because they open spam PRs and issues (just look at everything that's closed and titled as \".\"). Currently one of the maintainers just renames and closes the issue/PR, and blocks the spammer. I don't think this is at all controversial. I would not want this process to be bogged down in procedural things that are intended for dealing with more nuanced disputes.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI suggest that we move forward with the following:\r\n\r\n* Create a wiki page \"Moderation Guidelines\" with text outlining the suggestions from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1980365499\r\n* Choose a couple of people to be moderators and give them the moderator permission. I don't think this needs to be particularly rigorous, but a ACK/NACK vote-ish thing like we do for maintainers seems fine.\r\n* Enable the [Content Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-reported-content-in-your-organizations-repository) feature so that things can be reported to the moderators (I did not know this feature existing until now).\r\n* Setup a new repo bitcoin-core/modlog (or something like that) where moderators should be record moderation actions.",

All previous comments here, I believe, still apply.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1980365499 @ajtowns proposes a \"Moderation Guidelines\" document. I like the idea of writing about goals, explaining the available tools moderators have on github, and some helpful text about de-escalation for enraged internet users. All of that sounds somewhat helpful or at least harmless to the github project.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current meta \"Moderator Guidelines\" doc's transparency section introduces a requirement that \"it is critical for [moderators] to be clear about how decisions are made\" which seems like a very big departure from formlessness for the project overall? Another issue with the transparency section is that it imposes a bunch of extra work that doesn't scale with denial of service attacks against moderator attention or project resources. At most, surely, maybe a statement that a moderator has made a decision & then move on.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is for enemies. It is important to recognize that CoCs and similar policy or governance are effectively just instructions for your adversaries on how to defeat a project. At the same time, I believe the github repository and its members should absolutely defend itself (including by using moderators) and fight spam or other attacks on contributors' scarce time and attention.\r\n\r\nAlso: I would like to propose someone opens an issue for follow-up discussion in the meta repo, links to that issue here, and then closes this issue. I think moving meta talk to meta makes sense.",
