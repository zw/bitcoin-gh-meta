      "body" : "> I don't think that this is a good idea. The term \"block hash\" is used in dozens of RPCs, BIPs etc., basically everywhere all over the world. Renaming a single function within bitcoin core won't change that and will only lead to confusion that the header hash might be different from what the rest of the world calls the \"block hash\".\r\n\r\nThe rest of the world also doesn't think about stuff like block maleation, verification of the merkle root etc., but we do here in the code. If this helps us with reasoning about these things easier and prevents footguns, we should do it. If it's confusing someone who is contributing to this project that there is a distinction between hashing just header and hashing the whole block, I think that is a great learning opportunity for them and this might actually prevent them from shooting themselves in the foot in the future :)",
