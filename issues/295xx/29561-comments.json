      "body" : "In cross-referencing one of my own nodes (as the only ones I can really do any cross-checking on) I notice that the data returned for them from sipa's seeder (for my node) does not match what I expect in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Incorrect version string: reported as 24.0 rather than 26.0. The version _is_ reported correctly to me by another instance of bitcoind connecting to the node.\r\n2. Low uptime: this node has been running uninterrupted (and without fault) since early December, after being updated to v26.0. Before that it ran uninterrupted since the last major version update. Connectivity reported as <=30% does not feel congruent with its uptime.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation therefore is that it's possible that, if anything, we may be missing out on adding _more_ seed nodes to this list?\r\n\r\nIn any case, the results of a single node likely don't affect the general accuracy of the changes here and I suppose the changes proposed here are probably correct on balance.",
