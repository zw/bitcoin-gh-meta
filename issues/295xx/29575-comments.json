It seems cheap enough to process slightly-too-far-in-the-future headers, and they are enormously expensive to produce.\r\n\r\n(for other reviewers, look for `MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS` to see where this is handled)\r\n\r\nThe peer might also be telling us about a reorg longer than `MAX_BLOCKS_TO_ANNOUNCE = 8`. In `UpdatedBlockTip` we:\r\n\r\n> limit announcements in case of a huge reorganization.\r\n> Rely on the peer's synchronization mechanism in that case.\r\n\r\nSo we should not disconnect the first time around.\r\n\r\nThe `HandleFewUnconnectingHeaders` documentation should probably mention this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/fad8c5be6e05091e409186ea73e683a987e3b324 illustrates how we could limit this to just _once_ (`MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS = 2`), since > 8 block reorgs should be rare. If we were to immedidately disconnect (`MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS = 1` then step 5 of `p2p_sendheaders.py` fails). This doesn't account for the time difference issue. And in any case it can be done in a followup. And of course we wouldn't need an integer, but could instead call it `m_chicken_little`.",

If any of the headers are `> MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME * 10` in the future we disconnect with `time-too-new`. We could perhaps increase the number to allow for even more incorrect clocks, but I'm not sure how useful that is.\r\n\r\nSome of the comments in that commit may be spurious; I can't think of a useful attack where a peer (e.g. Bob) sends us headers, three hours in the future, with fake PoW. All Bob would achieve is that we ask another peer (Caroll) for the missing headers, which Caroll either won't have, or she does we disconnect her. The second time Bob tries this, we disconnect him.\r\n\r\nI also don't know if if it's even worth checking if a header is in the far future, but at least it makes for more useful log entries? (it's nice to know the difference between a peer with a broken clock and a peer that falsely announces a large reorg)",

      "body" : "I discussed this with @sdaftuar, @mzumsande, @sr-gi in person, and decided to instead just drop the Misbehavior score for unconnecting headers. The rationale is that this misbehavior was originally intended to prevent bandwidth wastage due to very broken (but likely non-malicious) nodes actually observed on the network that respond to GETHEADERS with a response unrelated to the request, triggering a request cycle. This has however largely been addressed by #25454, which limits the number of (not responded to) GETHEADERS requests in flight to one, with a 2 minute timeout. With that, the specific misbehavior is largely irrelevant (for inbound peers, it is now mostly harmless; for outbound peers, the eviction logic will eventually kick them out if they're not keeping up with headers at all).",
