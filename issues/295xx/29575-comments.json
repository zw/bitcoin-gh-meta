It seems cheap enough to process slightly-too-far-in-the-future headers, and they are enormously expensive to produce.\r\n\r\n(for other reviewers, look for `MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS` to see where this is handled)\r\n\r\nThe peer might also be telling us about a reorg longer than `MAX_BLOCKS_TO_ANNOUNCE = 8`. In `UpdatedBlockTip` we:\r\n\r\n> limit announcements in case of a huge reorganization.\r\n> Rely on the peer's synchronization mechanism in that case.\r\n\r\nSo we should not disconnect the first time around.\r\n\r\nThe `HandleFewUnconnectingHeaders` documentation should probably mention this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/fad8c5be6e05091e409186ea73e683a987e3b324 illustrates how we could limit this to just _once_ (`MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS = 2`), since > 8 block reorgs should be rare. If we were to immedidately disconnect (`MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS = 1` then step 5 of `p2p_sendheaders.py` fails). This doesn't account for the time difference issue. And in any case it can be done in a followup. And of course we wouldn't need an integer, but could instead call it `m_chicken_little`.",

If any of the headers are `> MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME * 10` in the future we disconnect with `time-too-new`. We could perhaps increase the number to allow for even more incorrect clocks, but I'm not sure how useful that is.\r\n\r\nSome of the comments in that commit may be spurious; I can't think of a useful attack where a peer (e.g. Bob) sends us headers, three hours in the future, with fake PoW. All Bob would achieve is that we ask ~another peer (Caroll)~ Bob for the missing headers, which ~Caroll either won't have, or she does we disconnect her~ he either sends, for which we disconnect. Or he doesn't send and tries again, at which point we disconnect him.\r\n\r\nI also don't know if if it's even worth checking if a header is in the far future, but at least it makes for more useful log entries? (it's nice to know the difference between a peer with a broken clock and a peer that falsely announces a large reorg)",

The rationale is that this misbehavior was originally intended to prevent bandwidth wastage due to very broken (but likely non-malicious) nodes actually observed on the network that respond to GETHEADERS with a response unrelated to the request, triggering a request cycle. This has however largely been addressed by #25454, which limits the number of (not responded to) GETHEADERS requests in flight to one, with a 2 minute timeout. With that, the specific misbehavior is largely irrelevant (for inbound peers, it is now mostly harmless; for outbound peers, the eviction logic will eventually kick them out if they're not keeping up with headers at all).",

This means that peers that keep sending us useless headers, will probably not enjoy this protection and eventually get replaced. Unless they _also_ give use useful data, in which case they're ... useful - and we can just humor their headers shenaningans.\r\n\r\n> ...  for outbound peers, the eviction logic will eventually kick them out if they're not keeping up with headers at all).\r\n\r\nIIUC outbound peer eviction is handled in `PeerManagerImpl::ConsiderEviction`, which loses its patience after `CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT + HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME`. That seems a bit late though, if all our outbound peers are slow? Even if that's rare, it seems better to have as many \"fit\" outbound peers as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso... It might still be useful, even if not needed for security, to _know_ if a peer sent us disconnecting headers. Although the `NET` log still provides a log message `received header %s: missing prev block %s, sending getheaders (%d) to end (peer=%d)`, we don't know the outcome.\r\n\r\nTracking if the peer did this before, e.g. with something like `m_chicken_little`, would make this easier. But not sure if it's worth the complexity. It seems all this would do is reveal that someone tried an attack that we believe to be useless.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "@Sjors It's worth taking into account that despite its history as originally being a \"DoS score\", the discouragement logic isn't particularly good at preventing *intentional* abuse of resources; scoring systems are inherently easy to bypass: just do enough to keep the score acceptable, and be as wasteful otherwise (or even better, if many IP addresses are available, use several). The only real solution, in my opinion, for actual DoS protection is keeping track of how many resources (bandwidth, CPU, I/O, ...) we spend on behalf of every peer, and whenever those resources become a bottleneck for us, throttle the worst peers.\r\n\r\nSo the purpose for the discouragement logic as I see it is avoiding wasting resources on (unintentionally) *broken* peers. These are somewhat distinct from *useless* peers (which is what the outbound eviction logic is aimed to prevent). There is an infinite amount of potential broken behavior one can imagine, and clearly we cannot have code for all of it. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for the misbehavior detection is to help protocol implementers get a good idea for expectations around parts of the protocol that aren't formally specified (because it triggers disconnections, and possibly logging). And arguably, unconnecting headers isn't a protocol violation, at least in the context of BIP130 announcements, so disconnecting for something that's very rare but not impossible to trigger in what we'd consider a perfectly compliant protocol implementation would be confusing.",

But if our peer is broken in a way that they ignore the contents of our locator and send us unconnecting headers again, we clear `m_last_getheaders_timestamp`, call `ProcessHeadersMessage` and immediately send a `GetHeaders` again (we wold only delay that if `m_last_getheaders_timestamp` hadn't been cleared)  - and after this PR we wouldn't discourage the peer anymore so that this could go on forever. How did #25454 address that?",

I've instead added that as a separate improvement, becoming the new first commit.\r\n\r\n@sr-gi I have not addressed the `p2p_filter.py` and `p2p_invalid_messages.py` using misbehavior logging.
