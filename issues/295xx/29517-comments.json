If so, given I can't see any major patches in https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/net/bitcoin/patches, you could compare how that is being compiled, to your compilation of `26.0`, as another avenue for debugging? Even though GCC compilation will be fixed shortly, my suggestion is to continue using the system compiler (Clang) and `--enable-debug`.",
