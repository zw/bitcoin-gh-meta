   "body" : "There have been a number of events over the past several months which have resulted in various individuals requesting that moderation action be taken. However, without any actual guidelines for when moderation actions should be taken, and of what sort, the bare minimum of moderating obvious spam is only done. This appears to leave many contributors dissatisfied as I have frequently heard grumblings about the behavior of various people leaving comments on PRs and issues. As such, I think it would be prudent for us to reconsider adding a Code of Conduct or otherwise some written rules of moderation so that moderation actions can be taken more proactively.\r\n\r\nWhile short pithy statements like \"be excellent to each other\" and \"don't be an asshole\" are great sound bites, they do very little to actually establish what behavior is acceptable, and when and what moderation actions can be taken. As someone who does moderation actions, personally I would like to have more guidance from other contributors on the moderation actions that they would like me to do.\r\n\r\nThe last time this was brought up, in #26890, there were concerns about the specific wording of the proposed Code of Conduct. Instead of proposing a specific text this time around, I've opted to first revisit the idea on its own, and we can try to nail down the text at a later date. But here are a few examples of Codes of Conduct that we may want to adopt (with modifications):\r\n\r\n* CoreDev events: https://github.com/coredev-tech/coredev-tech.github.io/blob/master/files/CoreDev-Code-of-Conduct.pdf\r\n* LDK: https://lightningdevkit.org/code_of_conduct/\r\n* Linux Kernel: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html\r\n* FreeBSD: https://www.freebsd.org/internal/code-of-conduct/\r\n* FSF/GNU: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html\r\n* Python: https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/\r\n* Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/\r\n\r\nThere were also a few concerns last time about a Code of Conduct or any other written rules being used as a vehicle for harassment. While I don't doubt that this is certainly possible, I think that having something written down would be overall more beneficial than not. I also think that if such a situation were to arise, it would be possible to amend the document to cover those cases.",
