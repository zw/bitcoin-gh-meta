As mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29412#issuecomment-1972837712 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29549#discussion_r1512904575, we would want to check (and accept) the header before logging, which would partially revert #29412. I don't think logging mutated blocks is worth doing this.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this is only a problem if the mutated block is submitted over a custom/broken P2P client that doesn't itself check the block. Any miner using `submitblock` on their node will notice that their block is mutated.\r\n\r\nIf still wanted, it's probably better to log mutated blocks in `debug=validation` (with e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27277).
