You need to -reindex (download the whole blockchain again in case of pruned node)\"\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n0.) Start from scratch, deleting the entire Bitcoin data directory if it exists (leaving no wallet file or blockchain data).\r\n1.) Install Bitcoin Core\r\n2.) Create Bitcoin data directory if it doesn't exist, create bitcoin.conf, set \"prune=550\" without quotes\r\n3.) Run Bitcoin Core\r\n4.) After you've verified, say, 100,000 blocks, close Bitcoin Core. Wait until the warning window to not shutdown/restart computer completely closes.\r\n5.) Run Bitcoin Core again, let it verify some more, close it again.\r\n6.) Rinse and repeat step 5...\r\n\r\nAt some point, I get the above error message on starting Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nI don't know what exactly is causing this, but if you're like me and you've verified a large amount of blocks and then you're told that you have to start completely over, you'll probably be pissed.\r\n\r\nThis error message is not new, as a related fix for this kind of error, when converting non-pruned nodes to pruned nodes was made here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6345\r\n\r\nWhile it's obviously easy to reproduce this error *if* you try plopping an *already existing* wallet.dat file into a pruned node data directory and then running Core -- that's not what I've been experiencing. I've been seeing this error with a brand new wallet.dat that was created from scratch *alongside* a fresh, pruned node.\"",
