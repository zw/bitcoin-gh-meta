It seems that randomly, after exit, the wallet database fails verification with `DB_SALVAGE|DB_AGRESSIVE` but otherwise works fine. E.g.\n\n```\nint result = db.verify(strFile.c_str(), NULL, &strDump, flags); \n```\n\nreturns `DB_VERIFY_BAD`.\n- However, the wallet works as normally. Non `-salvagewallet` doesn't see any problems at all.\n- Unlike the error message would have you believe, the salvage successfully recovers the entire wallet.\n\nHere's an example wallet that triggers this: https://dev.visucore.com/bitcoin/tmp/crapwallet.dat\n",

      "body" : "I've been digging into this failure over the last couple of days. This is what I've found so far:\r\n\r\n- This is fairly easy to reproduce. Just uncomment the `-salvagewallet` test and set BASE_SCRIPTS in test_runner.py to be a list `[[\"wallet.py\"] * 50]`. In a run of 50, I usually get one failure.\r\n\r\n- the problem is caused by running Berkeley DB's `Db::verify()` with the `DB_AGGRESSIVE` flag. The documentation for that is (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> Output all the key/data pairs in the file that can be found. By default, Db::verify() does not assume corruption. For example, if a key/data pair on a page is marked as deleted, it is not then written to the output file. When DB_AGGRESSIVE is specified, corruption is assumed, and any key/data pair that can be found is written. In this case, key/data pairs that are corrupted or have been deleted may appear in the output (even if the file being salvaged is in no way corrupt), and **the output will almost certainly require editing before being loaded into a database**.\r\n\r\n(from the BDB 4.8.30 docs)\r\n\r\n- Running `DB::verify()` with agressive set causes the output to be corrupt (more details below). I've tried this with the most recent version of Berkeley DB from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/downloads/index.html and an aggressive verify still corrupts the database.\r\n\r\n- you can repro the corruption manually by running the `db_dump` utility function, which is bundled with BDB. `-r` runs salvage and `-R` runs salvage with aggressive.\r\n\r\n- This is the wallet.dat file that I was using in my tests (renamed wallet.dat.txt as github has rules about file types): [wallet.dat.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/1053323/wallet.dat.txt). If I run db_dump on this .dat file with -R, the output ends:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/user/1000/bitcoin_test_runner_20170605_153749/wallet_273/node0/regtest/wallet.1496677614.bak: BDB0090 DB_VERIFY_BAD: Database verification failed\r\n```\r\n\r\n- if I run `db_dump` with `-r`, then I don't see the `DB_VERIFY_BAD` message.\r\n\r\n- piping `db_dump` through to `db_load` rebuilds a database. If I use `-R` on db_dump, then this fails, because the database dump is corrupt. If I use `-r`, on db_dump, then it succeeds, and most (all?) of the key-value pairs appear to be intact.\r\n\r\n- Digging a bit more into the corruption, if I look at the output of `db_dump -R`, it's a superset of the output of `db_dump -r`. There are some extra rows that look like normal keys/values, but there are also a bunch of these:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n 554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559\r\n 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\r\n 554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559\r\n 02000000010817df69d135686315416c5c2ab83d740882b5c733a2e24762dc4a1b52640e2000000000494830450221008732d20ce6ec67b39bbd6065149d66cd15fa10b1666512d2f72c315dadb4a5a802202de2365122b8f014994bdd8a98955f7ade117a1aadebd2b7769d1325f53c15e801ffffffff0200000000000000001976a914954ff91555b588a81796e3d1ae6313339ce28e4788acc0e4022a010000001976a914c58fb7d7c9407cf2eab0a7a52677869334c2c46488ac00000000ccf2bff45a3b0101020000000106e45a28096dd10e52d073e6a93ed5ae884aa1dc69fb4106df2656396da5d75f000000006b483045022100ede821e3abae05f5b94454bfe6e3cdf78525206355929b3bdc1fd11b5dc8d59102\r\n 554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559\r\n...\r\n 554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559\r\n 0a000000c97c3559000000000a2f00818c490200e87c3559000000002105000104f09d85a1280001046e61\r\n...\r\n 554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559\r\n 076b65796d6574612102548265736eb2677feaad5caefa4996b5316da452262c03f87d5acdc00ab55ee2\r\n 554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559\r\n 046e616d65226d74626e675a47434359686354435333537a365a7a6e76704c355739776439425075\r\n 554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559\r\n 04706f6f6c0900000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\n`554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559` is ascii for `UNKNOWN_KEY`.

You can see here that the final `554e4b4e4f574e5f4b4559` key is followed by `036b65792103c58cdbfc2b4cedd96e56d2714aa980a1478feb0bc5f9f7b6036e075eb974faef`, which is actually another key row (for a bitcoin public key). That means that the output of db_dump is out of alignment - there's actually an odd number of rows, so after this line, parsing keys/values gets mixed up.\r\n\r\n- I added some logging into `ReadKeyValue()` in bitcoind and see exactly the same thing when running with `-salvagewallet`.

values and vice versa).\r\n\r\nAfter running with `-salvagewallet`, the `wallet.dat` file is empty. *All* key-value pairs have gone. The wallet backup file `wallet.<timestamp>.bak` contains the db from before the salvage operation so still has all the key-value pairs.\r\n\r\n#### Next steps:\r\n\r\n- `-salvagewallet` should be changed to not set the aggressive flag. Note the documentation for that flag: **the output will almost certainly require editing before being loaded into a database**. Currently the salvagewallet operation just directly reads that output, so it's not entirely surprising that it occasionally fails.\r\n- we may want an option to run salvage wallet with the aggressive flag set, but that should only be once we have the bitcoin_wallet_tool from #8745.\r\n- once #8745 is merged, we should add targeted testing of salvagewallet (rather then the incidental testing we have in wallet.py). Gavin had some testing here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1895 / https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/3812689 which we might use as a start.\r\n- TBD whether we want to merge my extra logging on BDB reads. We could also add extra logging on writes.\r\n- we should try to figure out what BD writes are causing the DB to get into a state where `Db::verify()` with the `DB_AGGRESSIVE` flag fails. Additional logging will help there. I can also add an option to the integration tests which verifies the wallet.dat files of every node at the end of every test.",
