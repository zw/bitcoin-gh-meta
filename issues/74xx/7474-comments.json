      "body" : "This is based on a confusion: `-externalip` does **not** set the bind address - neither for incoming nor outgoing addresses - what is does is change what address is advertised to other nodes. This is useful when the software cannot determine the outside connection address itself, e.g. to advertise an onion hidden service address.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to set the bind address for the listening port using `-bind`. Hardly any software allows choosing the bind address for outgoing connections, neither does bitcoind. There is a feature request for that open: #6476.\r\n",

I assumed the -externalip is for outgoing connection so that when I set it the same as -bind address, both incoming and outgoing packets will be using the same address. I guess -externalip is only useful for NAT-ed address which is only relevant for IPv4 addresses.\r\n\r\nI will wait for the implementation of the feature request #6476.",
