   "body" : "I'm in the process of testing 0.12 in our dev environment for one of our java-based services. This service makes RPC requests to bitcoind, but when I upgrade from 0.11 to 0.12 every request now gets a 401 \"unauthorized\" response.\r\n\r\nThe RPC server is clearly still functional because I can query it manually via cURL. However, breaking Java's Authenticator may be problematic - it is the recommended way to authenticate according to the wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC)\r\n\r\nOne strange thing to note is that usage of Java Authenticator still works on OS X with Core 0.12. This appears to be a platform-specific issue. I'm not sure about Windows.\r\n\r\nI was able to implement a workaround by setting the authentication in the HTTP request manually as shown in http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-connect-to-a-url-using-basic-authentication.html",
