Some examples:\r\n\r\nCensoring large forums to hide the existing of other teams/clients.\r\nDDoS'ing Bitcoin XT nodes and pools.\r\nDDoS'ing Coinbase.\r\nRemoving Coinbase from bitcoin.org\r\n\r\nSince these things reflect very badly on the Core team, it would be good to have a public announcement, distancing the team from such attacks and discouraging those attacks since they are not helping anyone.",
