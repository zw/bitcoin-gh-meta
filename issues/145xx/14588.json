   "body" : "As discussed in the comments on #14473, I think that bug was caused primarily by failure to adhere to the invariant that a PSBTInput always has exactly one of the two utxo fields present -- an invariant that is already enforced by PSBTInput::IsSane, but which we were temporarily suspending during signing.\r\n\r\nThis refactor repairs the invariant, also fixing the bug. It also simplifies some other code, and removes redundant parameters from some related functions.\r\n\r\nfixes #14473",
