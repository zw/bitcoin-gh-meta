   "body" : "Hello! \r\n\r\nI am running a bitcoin core node on my macbook with datadir on an external hard drive. The sync performance wasn't great so I searched to improve it and I found this thread https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10647#issuecomment-312466993  \r\n\r\nPeter is suggesting to keep the chainstate on internal disk but only moving blocks on external disk. My question is, is there some plans to let user the possibility to specify that in the config file instead of creating symlink, having chainstatedir and blocksdir parameters in addition to datadir?\r\n\r\nThank you",
