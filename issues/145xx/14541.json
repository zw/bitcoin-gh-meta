   "body" : "After upgrading to 0.17.0 I loaded one of my wallet.dat files, which is used occasionally to find that even with full sync some recent transactions I've seen on blockchain are not shown in Bitcoin Core. \r\nPrior to 0.17.0 all went smooth - I put the wallet.dat I need where it belongs, fire up Bitcoin Core and see all the incoming transactions not yet in those wallet.dat.\r\nAs of now I had to manually force rescan via bitcoin.conf to see the missing transactions. \r\n\r\nOS: win 7 x64. \r\n\r\nI suspect it may be caused by versioning issues, since the file was saved under 0.16.3, however when upgrading from 0.16.0 to 0.16.3, or from 0.15.0 to 0.16.0 I had no such behavior.\r\n\r\n",
