(maybe it already exists)\r\nwumpus | esotericnonsense: I think that's a good suggestion, no that doesn't exist, feel free to make an issue!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the scale of this and how problemy it is, but if mumblings I've heard about 3000+ nodes having publicly accessible RPC are true it seems unlikely to be a wilful configuration.",
