So I tried to really think about what the experience would be like for a new user. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, I did figure out that the value most likely was referring to percentage points, but I was not 100% sure, and thinking about this took a big chunk of my attention focus as a new user. The user should not have to think about what the UI is telling him/her, it should be crystal clear.  Maybe the hourly progress increase should be removed altogether, or - better - replaced with some graphical component (like a histogram with sync speed history since the sync started).   \r\n",
