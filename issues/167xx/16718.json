While this map implementation is definitely preferable to `std::map` (which retains order and has O(log(n)) lookups insted of O(1)), both stdlib maps are subpar [relative to non-`std` alternatives](https://martin.ankerl.com/2019/04/01/hashmap-benchmarks-01-overview/).\r\n\r\nAfter seeing cacheCoins as a bottleneck, I decided to try swapping one of these alternative implementations in to see if there is any benefit. It looks like there is.\r\n\r\n![ibd local range 500000 520000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644703-0a927600-c6bd-11e9-9e1d-2748b8fbdf8d.png)\r\n\r\nFor 20,000 blocks at a representative part of the chain, we see something like a 15% speedup with a 19.3% reduction in memory usage (dbcache was set to 3000).\r\n\r\nThe `CCoinsCaching` benchmark shows improvement but not as dramatically as IBD does:\r\n\r\n![microbenches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644768-572a8100-c6be-11e9-922c-8360a9f9e3b4.png)\r\n\r\nObviously adding 2000 lines of new consensus-critical code isn't appealing, but if those numbers hold for the full IBD process I think there might be a compelling case to be made for the added code.\r\n\r\n### Implementations considered\r\n\r\nOf the few best-looking options, I picked the one with the most succinct implementation and fewest dependencies, [`robin_hood::unordered_node_map`](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing) (it's just a header file). I also looked at Facebook's [`F14NodeMap`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/container/F14.md) and Abseil's [`node_hash_map`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/container) but both required too much elbow-grease (for now) to integrate here without pulling in a whole lot of code.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nI'm going to be running more comprehensive benchmarks, including a near-full IBD from the network, to see if these improvements hold.\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in benching this along with a similar change to `mapBlockIndex` (currently a `std::unordered_map`).\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\nIf we decide to include this or another hashmap implementation, should we do a full fork inclusion a la leveldb or should we try to slim down the implementation to a single header file as is done here (but more)?",
