Passing it down avoids OOM on weak machines and allows better use of resources on beefy machines.\r\n* Move CCACHE_DIR to ./ci/scratch/ subfolder: `ccache` is executed with root permissions inside the docker, so the cache files are created with root as owner. So it might be wise to not put them in the $HOME of the host\r\n* Use the scratch dir as prefix for the test runner, as opposed to `/tmp/`, which is often a ramdisk and thus leads to OOM on the host when either a lot of tests are run in parallel or when a lot of tests fail and the datadirs are not cleaned.",
