It's debatable whether this should be cleaned up when the app is uninstalled however that's outweighed by the fact that it's existing behaviour that users will certainly be depending on. IMHO this key needs to stay as is.\r\n\r\nThe other delete key in the PR wasn't needed in my testing:\r\n\r\n`DeleteRegKey HKLM \"SOFTWARE\\Bitcoin Core (@WINDOWS_BITS@-bit)`\r\n\r\nThe existing installer (bitcoin-0.18.1-win64-setup.exe from https://bitcoin.org/en/download) already deletes that key as a result of:\r\n\r\n`DeleteRegKey /IfEmpty HKCU \"${REGKEY}\"`",

Registry keys are like folders, while registry values are like files within folders. Don't mix them.\r\nNSIS Bitcoin uninstaller script right now removes values first and keys later. This is unnecessary.\r\nThe original author of the script must have done this under the pretense that registry keys have to be completely empty to be deleted when using the `/IfEmpty` flag. This is not true. As described in the [link](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/mediawiki/index.php?title=Reference/DeleteRegKey&oldid=21290) you have sent before, /IfEmpty flag looks for subkeys, not values.\r\nSince those registry keys in question don't have any subkeys, the lines `DeleteRegKey /IfEmpty` will delete the key with all its values. If a user should create a subkey him/herself, the key would not be deleted since it would not be \"empty\".",
