   "body" : "This is based on #15798.\r\n\r\nI'm increasingly worried about censorship and other attacks in the P2P network (see, eg, https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1160620919775211520). While obviously making the net_processing p2p implementation more robust should be the focus (eg #15759), adding more redundancy in every way is also key. To avoid needless review burden on such systems, I think rust is an ideal candidate: it is wholly optional so we don't just right to requiring Rust for Bitcoin Core, but building with it still provides real benefit, plus we can use compile-time checks to catch any overflows and memory corruption bugs to reduce review burden.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a simple API for Rust code to fetch headers and blocks and then implements a sample client that can sync the chain using a REST endpoint. As a demo, I provide a rest endpoint over cloudflare at http://cloudflare.deanonymizingseed.com/rest/ so you should be able to fully sync the chain (albeit very slowly) with bitcoind -blockfetchrest=http://cloudflare.deanonymizingseed.com/rest/ -connect=0\r\n\r\nThere's a few things to do before this is mergable, but I'd like feedback on the idea, and would like to also have a fully parallel, in rust, P2P net layer that is similarly simple and provides a nice redundant implementation in the future.",
