I've tried to split it up in multiple ways but every time I attempt to do it, it just increases the total diff.\r\n- In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/fb78590939ff2d8c008cfd68f2f7df816389ac01, we introduce `CJDNS` as a new supported network. `CJDNS` addresses are simple IPv6 addresses under a certain prefix, \r\n- In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/e10f8bfcaec44cf1e7b73c390225b80644e8367f, I'm wondering if there are better ways of structuring the code for ignoring single `addr` entries, and the entire message.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThings that surprised me:\r\n- `addrMe` was deprecated and no one seemed to remember: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#issuecomment-524444473\r\n",
