This allows to return a more appropriate p2wpkh for p2pkh and p2pk scriptpubkeys, and (currently) p2wsh for all the rest.\r\n2. The data returned for the segwit scripts is its own univalue object (@promag suggestion), so it includes more useful info like the segwit scriptpubkey and type, along with the bech32 address.\r\n\r\nVarious examples of the output can be seen here :\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/fivepiece/e25b0fcdf8303fdbfd56363ae50dec15\r\n\r\nCaveats :\r\n\r\n1. For the segwit scriptpubkeys, we always have `\"reqSigs\": 1`.\r\n2. It's still possible to get a segwit program address for scripts using checksigs with uncompressed pubkeys.  This is because `GetScriptForWitness()` doesn't check `vSolutions` for presense of such pubkeys.  It's probably be possible to change GetScriptForWitness to check for that when bare pubkeys are invloved in the script, but out of scope for this PR.",
