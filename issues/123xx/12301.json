I used a Yobit wallet for this test. The withdrawal went through and now sits in a litecoin address I have no private key of\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you expect?\r\n\r\nI would expect the transaction to bounce, since it's generated from a Bitcoin address\r\n\r\nWhat was the actual behavior?\r\n\r\nThe transferred litecoin now sits in what originally was a Bitcoin address\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
