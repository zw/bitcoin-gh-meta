   "body" : "Before this, if someone imported a scriptPubKey directly (in hex form) using `importaddress`, outputs sending to it would be treated as change, as the corresponding CTxDestination was not added to the address book.\n\nFix this by trying to detect scriptPubKeys that are in fact convertible to a CTxDestination and add them anyway. Add a warning to the RPC help to warn against importing raw non-standard scripts.\n\nOpen question: should the RPC fail/warn in some way when this conversion is not possible? Things like `listunspent` work fine with such outputs, but `listtransactions` won't.\n",
