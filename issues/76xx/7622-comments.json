At that time, miners hadn't yet decided to raise their block size cap, so action Bitcoin Core would take there would be preÃÂ«mptive. In contrast, this time round block sizes are regularly surpassing the 750kB limit, so now we're actually catching up with where the miners have already gone.",

Users (including miners) should use the configurable options with whatever values they prefer instead of constantly asking to change defaults.\r\nThere's also alternative releases that change defaults or policy code like http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin-ljr/ : not all implementation need to share bitcoin core's relay/mining policy defaults or even have the same policy code.\r\n",

As a side note, I do think that those who can demonstrate considerable investment in bitcoin should get more say on this than those who don't, so if a democratic aspect were to be invoked I would suggest it be one vote per bitcoin rather than one vote per person.",
