We could change the build system of the GUI even in the same repository; if that were what we really wanted, I think that'd even be easier than doing it in separate repositories.\r\n\r\nRegarding the separation of repositories, I believe that is only a good idea if there is a well-defined stable interface between the codebases. Otherwise, you run into difficulties whenever changes to the boundary between the two need to be made, like lockstep commits and the synchronization overhead between the two projects - exactly what separating them likely was intended to avoid.

After all we still need to have the code in this repo to run the guix build and produce the gui binaries, so it seems easiest to put whatever needs to be done inside this repo.\r\n\r\nI think the design goals of Bitcoin Core should also (on a best effort basis) be applied to the GUI. So if you want to introduce a new GUI feature and it seems useful, it should be added here. If it doesn't seem useful, it probably shouldn't be added, neither here or in a separate repo or separate build system.\r\n",
