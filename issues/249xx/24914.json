   "body" : "Currently when we load a wallet, we just iterate through all of the records in the database and add them completely statelessly. However we have some records which do rely on other records being loaded before they are. To deal with this, we use `CWalletScanState` to hold things temporarily until all of the records have been read and then we load the stateful things.\r\n\r\nHowever this can be slow, and with some future improvements, can cause some pretty drastic slowdowns to retain this pattern. So this PR changes the way we load records by choosing to load the records in a particular order. This lets us do things such as loading a descriptor record, then finding and loading that descriptor's cache and key records. In the future, this will also let us use `IsMine` when loading transactions as then `IsMine` will actually be working as we now always load keys and descriptors before transactions.\r\n\r\nIn order to get records of a specific type, this PR includes some refactors to how we do database cursors. Functionality is also added to retrieve a cursor that will give us records beginning with a specified prefix.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing that iterating the entire database let us do was to find unknown records. However even if unknown records were found, we would not do anything with this information except output a number in a log line. With this PR, we would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This does not change functionality as we don't do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not an error. Now we would just not be aware that unknown records even exist.",
