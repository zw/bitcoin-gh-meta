The changes are not very invasive, most work was probably to change from passing a single string to a list of arguments.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is motivated to continue the work or maybe just want to evaluate if cpp-subprocess is a proper replacement candidate, feel free to take the commits. I'm currently not running any Windows system where I could even test the changes, the best I can do is to cross-compile (which as said above, doesn't even work yet) and run the unit tests via Wine. cpp-subprocess' README.md says:\r\n> Support for Windows is limited at this time. Please report any specific use-cases that fail, and they will be fixed as they are reported.\r\n\r\nso there are likely more changes needed to make everything work as expected.",
