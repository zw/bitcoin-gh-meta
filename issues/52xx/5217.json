   "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\ni had to export bootstrap file from some favorite altcoins. There is already an export script, but that is very slow, because blocks are queried from rpc. So i added some funcions to the coin's codebase, so the bootstrap export is accelerated by this. I want to share my code.\r\n\r\nThe are two commit in this push: one made the export by running the daemon/wallet. the second allow made the bootstrap in a running daemon/wallet.\r\n\r\nThe command line parameter required a filename or filepath. The bootstrap data is exported to this file. There are another two helper parameter, this allow exporting a part of the blockchain: the first blocks (minheight) and the last blocks (maxheight).\r\n\r\nThe rpc command do the same: require a filename/filepath parameter, and the optional first/last blockheight.\r\nIf no first/last are given, the whole blockchain is exported (1..bestblockheight).\r\n\r\nIf you like this feature, feel free to give some notes.\r\n\r\nNote: the rpc exporting sould made by a separete thread, but i dont know how to modify the [TraceThread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/util.h#L200) function to pass parameter(s).",
