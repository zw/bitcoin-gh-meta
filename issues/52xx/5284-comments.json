All 256 values for the\nhashtype byte are valid. There are just only 6 intended ones.\n\nThe reason for splitting DER off from hashtype checks is because DER\nviolations pose a malleability problem (which BIP62 plans to make illegal\nin a softfork), while the unknown hashtypes are at most a minor\nimplementation complication, and only made nonstandard for now.",
