A backup should be somehow a 1:1 copy.\r\nIf a user enables `-backupsdumps` AND `-backupsallowunencrypted` he can do unencrypted dumps as backups.\r\n\r\nBefore working on encrypted dumps as backup possibilities i would prefer to implement the/a backup mechanism in the GUI.",

      "body" : "@jonasschnelli   Things other than private keys are not encrypted because otherwise the user is forced to enter their key at every startup or use, which is inconvenient and would punish users for using encryption and would leave their key more vulnerable to observation by malware or people around them. The entry of the key also becomes an important consent point: a user of an encrypted wallet can never accidentally send money no matter how stupidly they click or how far they explore.\r\n\r\nEncryption of a wallet is not usually adequate for privacy on your local computer in any case:  your logs, browser cache, etc all leak much of the same data...  When we talk about backups the situation is somewhat different, and I can agree it may make sense to have all the data encrypted there.  If I were to do it again I would have an master key encrypted with the hardened user passphrase used to derive separate keys for encrypting the whole wallet and the private keys. At the first use, I'd cache the whole wallet subkey (but not the private key one) in a separate file.  This way backups would preserve privacy, so long as they didn't backup the cache.\r\n\r\nBIP32 is not at all a replacement for backups; at most it protects key material. It does nothing to preserve metadata which can be absolutely critical (keeping in mind that in much of the developed world if your taxes are audited its up to you to prove you were paying what you owed). I somewhat regret inventing the public derivation thats most commonly used now-- it's overused, and in ways that harm security (often by people who do not understand the implications). \r\n",
