But I don't like the way the key is mapped into the SHA-256 key schedule.\r\nThe value V (32 bytes long) ends up at the beginning of the compression block, so that the key ends up being combined with mostly fixed bytes with sparse ones. E.g. w[16], w[17] ... could be susceptible to timing attacks if the addition operation has variable time depending on the number of carries. Also electromagnetic and power consumption side-channels could be used to detect those carries.\r\nAgain, this is pure speculation, but I think the key should have been laid at the beginning of the compression block, and not after a fixed known mostly-zero pattern",
