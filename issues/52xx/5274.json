   "body" : "Using the Bitcoin Core GUI with #5161 merged shows unexpected behaviour. Using the peers tab in our debug console now lists clear IPv4 addresses for reached \"via\". When selecting a peer this is displayed below the peers address. I'm rather sure this always listed just the .onion address I supply via -externalip and no IPv4 address. I'm not even sure where they are coming from, are these Tor exit node IPs? They are not my own public addresses and seem to differ from peer to peer.\r\n\r\nI'm using Tor as proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 set via the optionsdialog and the following command line for starting: ``-bind=127.0.0.1 -externalip=XYZ.onion``.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell Any idea for this?",
