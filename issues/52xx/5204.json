   "body" : "Most likely this is a no-issue for us, because we can't solve it, but perhaps we can brainstorm some ideas if we can extend error messages or reporting stuff to users.\n\nThis is what happened, I tried to pay via BitPay using my Bitcoin Core wallet while connected to the network via Tor. After clicking the payment button on the BitPay site I got this warning displayed to me (this is from my debug.log):\n`GUI: PaymentServer::netRequestFinished :  \"Kommunikationsfehler mit https://bitpay.com/i/XYZ: Error downloading https://bitpay.com/i/XYZ - server replied: Forbidden\"`\n\nI know that BitPay is using Cloudflare as hoster or technical base and that Cloudflare is blocking Tor exit nodes! This is \"only\" annoying if visiting their site via browser, as they offer a (stupid) captcha. But it get's totally stupid if using payment requests on their site, because of not being able to proceed.\n\nI had to reconnect with Tor disabled to do my payment, which sucked! Any ideas, for how we could handle such a case or error situation from a UX view?\n",
