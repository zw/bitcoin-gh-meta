As @sipa mentioned on the other PR, by \"app state\", I mean that the allocators pull in the global singleton which is fine for bitcoind and friends, but I'd very much like to avoid that for libs.\r\n\r\nYea, a base class beneath CKey would solve the problem I should think. Imo, it'd be nice to have it somewhat storage-agnostic, so that a lib could potentially pass in its own backing store. Ultimately the key would have to be accessed (obviously), but we could at least limit how much it's passed around so that the caller could retain as much control over the sensitive bits as possible.\r\n\r\nRunning with that idea a bit, would it be feasible for CKey to retain only a pointer, and we pass in a pointer from our securely-allocated buffer which is held elsewhere?",

I'm sure all of that could be organized somehow into something that doesn't involve actually messing with pointers all over the place.\r\n\r\nI do think we should probably discuss this elsewhere though, I don't want to slow down this PR for something unrelated.
