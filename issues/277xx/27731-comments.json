      "body" : "Yeah, I think it will be hard to find a number where there isn't a specific limit and specific circumstances that would still cause problems. If we set the limit dynamically based on what's really available there would be a range where we would effectively set `evhttp_set_max_connections(http, 0);` which would probably mean that we couldn't even shut down the server via the RPC interface.\r\n\r\nWhen the maxconnections are reduced to 15 that doesn't mean that there are only 15 file descriptors left. There are more reserved than are not always needed. But that part of the code certainly could use improvement, see #27539 and #27730. I think making changes to the maxconnections calculation is not necessarily linked to this change here because it could reduce the risk of running out of FDs regardless. Also, note that the node will even start if you set `ulimit -n 150` and it have maxconnection at 0. So that is another question to discuss if that even makes sense. Because if we alter the calculation of maxconnections but still let the node run regardless of what the result is, we haven't really prevented the file descriptor exhaustion completely. And it may be too limiting on the other hand if we set the requirements of available file descriptors so high that we can absolutely be sure the node will not encounter an exhaustion under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nSo, I am not sure what would be the optimal number to use. I think we can still tweak this later so it covers the most common use cases best. What I am currently concerned about is if this actually improves the situation in #11368 for the default file descriptor limits in the most commonly used OS. macOS was among the lowest as far as I remember and it was 256 usually I think. So I am currently aiming at showing that it's an improvement for that. But I do struggle to reproduce the original issue on my new machine right now so I am not 100% sure anymore if this actually needs fixing. Though I am on a different machine now than I was back then.",
