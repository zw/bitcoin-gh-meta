(aside from dev curiosity, where I agree that wouldn't be bad to know why).\r\n\r\nThe test goal is to exercise `getblockfrompeer` and not pruning nor where blocks are stored. Having all those hardcoded heights, expecting to have a precise number of blocks in each block file, looks quite fragile.\r\n\r\nI mean, all the hardcoded `pruneheight` numbers and `pruneblockchain(num)` calls looks random at first. It takes a bit to realize that the numbers were picked to prune one block file at time. The `pruneblockchain()` numbers are also extended a bit just in case block files are bigger. Check how they are called: `pruneblockchain(300)`,  `pruneblockchain(700)` when each block file has ~250 blocks; this is my local `getblockfileinfo()` output on each of the three block files presented in the test prior the first `pruneblockchain` call:\r\n\r\n{'blocks_num': 249, 'lowest_block': 0, 'highest_block': 248, 'data_size': 65319, 'undo_size': 10168}\r\n{'blocks_num': 251, 'lowest_block': 249, 'highest_block': 499, 'data_size': 65511, 'undo_size': 10291}\r\n{'blocks_num': 106, 'lowest_block': 500, 'highest_block': 605, 'data_size': 27666, 'undo_size': 4346}\r\n\r\n At least with the `getblockfileinfo()` call we are explicitly pruning the first file, then the second one, etc. Without having to remember how many blocks are stored in each file, nor requiring to extend the prune height just in case.\r\n\r\nI also think that `getblockfileinfo` could be useful in other test contexts as well. Plus, I'm not sure how people call `pruneblockchain` right now, sounds like they blindly call it with a height and only realize up to which block the node pruned the chain when the command returns.\r\n\r\n(if we choose to go into this direction, can remove the remaining hardcoded prune heights in the test).",

This should guarantee that all of these 400 blocks will be processed by compact block reconstruction.\r\n\r\nYeah, I know. theStack investigation is awesome!. We kept ping-ponging about it after this PR was pushed :). And also martin's fix sounds good.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like the first sentence in my previous [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27770#issuecomment-1565677870) remove it. It was just the intro, no hard feelings. The background rationale there still applies even with the investigation and the possible fix.\r\n\r\nThe test is still fragile, the hardcoded `pruneblockchain` heights are off by a good degree to cover possible pruning diffs, an also not well documented. I don't think that anyone knew that the `pruneblockchain(300)` or `pruneblockchain(700)` test calls are there to remove the first and second block file (when first block file highest block number is 250, and second one is 500..).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, what theStack analysis really says is that `pruneblockchain` result is not accurate. Which is the real issue for me. The RPC command result description says that it returns the \"height of the last block pruned\", which could not be true as blocks could have been stored out of order.\r\nSo retrieving block height 249 as \"last block pruned\" doesn't mean that block 248 has been pruned from disk.\r\n\r\nSo, I actually think that adding the `getblockfileinfo` RPC command makes even more sense now. Not to solve the current intermittent issue, but to make the manual pruning process clearer for users and tests (check the penultimate paragraph in my previous [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27749#issuecomment-1566554075)). And also as a debugging tool.",

As an illustration, the blocks directory of a mainnet test-run of AssumeUTXO ended up at some point like this on my disk:\r\n```\r\n$ ls -l ./datadir2/blocks/blk*.dat \r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  133255069 May 21 12:38 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00123.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  133591927 May 21 20:35 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00226.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  134063604 May 23 00:47 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00278.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  133150555 May 23 00:49 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00285.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  100663296 May 23 02:51 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00286.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  133995151 May 23 02:51 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00400.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  133651193 May 23 02:51 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00401.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  133962542 May 23 02:52 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00402.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack  133673223 May 23 02:52 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00403.dat\r\n-rw-------  1 thestack  thestack   50331648 May 23 02:53 ./datadir2/blocks/blk00404.dat\r\n```\r\nFor finding out where the block-file gaps come from, which rough block height ranges were stored in which of the different block files, having `getblockfileinfo` at hand would have been very nice.\r\n\r\nThough, I'm less convinced that typical users would have a strong need for that RPC, as the block-file structure is something internal that shouldn't be really relevant for typical use -- I doubt users running `pruneblockchain` care in detail which block files are removed, I'd figure it's more like signalling \"I don't need blocks up to height N anymore, if you can, please get rid of them\". But at least as I'm aware, introducing test-only RPCs is fine and not an common practice at all (see `git grep \\\"hidden\\\")`.",

      "body" : "FWIW, I was curious how hard it would be to implement `getblockfileinfo` in the functional test framework by parsing the block files: https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/blob/97ea647ee9b186ff4d3be2ba5ac91b94e5371323/test/functional/test_framework/util.py#L559-L584 (branch https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/tree/getblockfileinfo_python)\r\n\r\nThe result seems to work, but is still kind of ugly and hacky. To get a parsed block's height (without flooding the node with hundreds of `getblockheader` RPC requests), we need to analyze its coinbase's scriptSig (see [BIP34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki)), with the need for an exception on the genesis block (or for any other blocks that don't follow BIP34, if we'd ever generate ones in our tests). It's probably generally a bad idea to access block files while the node is running, at least for the latest one which is currently still written to by bitcoind. So if we want that functionality, then implementing it as a RPC seems to be reasonable. It might also make sense to get more general information, e.g. about what block files are available (as discussed on IRC via @furszy).",
