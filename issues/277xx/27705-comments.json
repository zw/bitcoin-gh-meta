The client seems to really like requesting blocks from the peer in question, so I'm guessing it get blocks earlier than most other peers, and possibly gets overloaded because of it. In some cases it even looks to be requesting another block from it while it is already downloading one - and in some cases it seems to successfully download the second block then timeout on the first?

This doesn't apply to special-category logs like `debug=net` because users who activate those are expected to monitor their node more closely.\r\nThere have been mitigations suggested (e.g. #21603) but none of those have made it in so far.\r\nThat being said, I agree that `debug=net` is quite messy and could use different levels of verbosity.",

But when a connection is closed due to a block download timeout, you already generate a log entry `Timeout downloading block x from peer=y, disconnecting` with the default logging level. As such it shouldn't add any risk of such attacks if the remote address was simply added to this line, something like `peer=x addr=x.x.x.x`?",
