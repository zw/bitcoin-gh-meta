For example, if you have an addrman with mostly IPv4/IPv6 addresses and a few onion ones then restart with `-onlynet=onion`, will it take noticeably longer to find peers? The worst case scenario would be if you had just a single onion address, but that doesn't seem realistic, so I'd be more interested about the case where you have between 5% and 10% onion addresses.",
