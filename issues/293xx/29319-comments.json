So an attacker who simply did a straightforward pinning attack on an ephemeral anchor spend could force the defender to spend an additional:\r\n\r\n    20sat/vB * 1000vB = 20,000sat = $8 USD\r\n\r\njust to get their transaction mined, at almost no cost to themselves. We need a better solution than that. One obvious one would be to make the 1000vB limit much smaller, eg the same size as a 2-in, 1 out, anchor spend. A Replace-by-Fee-Rate carveout for this specific case is another potential solution. (and as @ariard mentions, replace-by-fee-rate in general is a solution; IIUC one-shot replace-by-fee-rate will be quite a bit easier to implement with the cluster mempool work)",

It seems to me that sibling eviction rules could efficiently handle the 1-child-multiple-parent cases, but I may be missing something. I thought that the rules could be:\r\n\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have multiple unconfirmed v3 parents (but is limited by the 1000 vbytes threshold)\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have at most one unconfirmed child\r\n- a v3 transaction that has unconfirmed parents cannot have unconfirmed children\r\n\r\nThose rules ensure that we have at most two generations of unconfirmed v3 txs in a package. When evaluating sibling eviction, it's thus easy to figure out the replaced package, it only consists of the sibling with all of its unconfirmed parents. We can then apply package RBF rules (not the current RBF rules though) to efficiently replace this, and it should be easier to evaluate whether it's more incentive compatible?\r\n\r\nIt does require different package RBF rules than BIP 125 though:\r\n\r\n- we mustn't apply BIP 125 rules 2 and 3\r\n- rule 4 should probably be replaced by an increase in total package feerate\r\n\r\nThis is probably much more complex than the current sibling eviction proposal, and I may be missing important details as well, so feel free to ignore!",

So long as the N block threshold isn't too large, transactions that don't quite reach the threshold have a decent chance of getting mined eventually. Similarly, since the threshold is dynamic, it's likely that the threshold will reduce at some point, allowing a fee-bump will put it over the threshold.\r\n\r\nI've already implemented one-shot replace-by-fee-rate in a sense with the pure-replace-by-fee-rate implementation in Libre Relay: it has N=0, so replacement is always possible. That might not always be strictly incentive compatible for miners. But it's not that far off. I'd estimate roughly 30 nodes are running it at the moment; hopefully I'll convince a miner to run it too once more people get confident that it doesn't introduce new, effective, DoS attacks.\r\n\r\n> > \"This topic is about the CPFP carveout rule, which cannot be supported in the cluster mempool design.

I know for a fact that many large LN nodes do not make their Bitcoin nodes publicly accessible to avoid attacks like this (of course, many don't even make their LN nodes publicly accessible).",

If that's the case, there is no need to post general criticisms of v3 here. See #28948 description for a list of threads dedicated to discussing v3.\r\n\r\n> My proposal is dynamic, as I mention in the [Pure Replace-By-Fee-Rate](https://petertodd.org/2024/one-shot-replace-by-fee-rate#pure-replace-by-fee-rate) section: \"In a rising fee-rate environment, the one-shot policy may degrade to pure replace-by-fee-rate.\"\r\n\r\nUnless your alternative proposal is relevant to CPFP carve out removal and/or cluster mempool, it is off topic here. Again, there are separate threads that are more appropriate.",
