So an attacker who simply did a straightforward pinning attack on an ephemeral anchor spend could force the defender to spend an additional:\r\n\r\n    20sat/vB * 1000vB = 20,000sat = $8 USD\r\n\r\njust to get their transaction mined, at almost no cost to themselves. We need a better solution than that. One obvious one would be to make the 1000vB limit much smaller, eg the same size as a 2-in, 1 out, anchor spend. A Replace-by-Fee-Rate carveout for this specific case is another potential solution. (and as @ariard mentions, replace-by-fee-rate in general is a solution; IIUC one-shot replace-by-fee-rate will be quite a bit easier to implement with the cluster mempool work)",

It seems to me that sibling eviction rules could efficiently handle the 1-child-multiple-parent cases, but I may be missing something. I thought that the rules could be:\r\n\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have multiple unconfirmed v3 parents (but is limited by the 1000 vbytes threshold)\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have at most one unconfirmed child\r\n- a v3 transaction that has unconfirmed parents cannot have unconfirmed children\r\n\r\nThose rules ensure that we have at most two generations of unconfirmed v3 txs in a package. When evaluating sibling eviction, it's thus easy to figure out the replaced package, it only consists of the sibling with all of its unconfirmed parents. We can then apply package RBF rules (not the current RBF rules though) to efficiently replace this, and it should be easier to evaluate whether it's more incentive compatible?\r\n\r\nIt does require different package RBF rules than BIP 125 though:\r\n\r\n- we mustn't apply BIP 125 rules 2 and 3\r\n- rule 4 should probably be replaced by an increase in total package feerate\r\n\r\nThis is probably much more complex than the current sibling eviction proposal, and I may be missing important details as well, so feel free to ignore!",
