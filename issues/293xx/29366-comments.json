I understand and I know the risk of targeted attacks on members, I think it has to be weighted with better accountability.\r\n\r\nPGP every communications of sensitive info hardens against eventual interceptions by adversaries and beyond it allows to apply ethical monitoring among participants to a given vulnerabilities responsibility group, e.g see linux kernel memorandum of understanding (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.8-rc1/process/embargoed-hardware-issues.html#memorandum-of-understanding). Iâm not giving a wildcard on core sect list members on this concern.\r\n\r\nIf full publicity is an overwhelming personal risk model for some sec list members, they can think more about it and take time to resign, I can understand.
