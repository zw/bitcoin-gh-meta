Problem of Security: P2PK, exposes the bare public key to the world, and if ever ECDSA gets broken, we might lose our funds\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n> because weâre storing the public keys in the ScriptPubKey field, theyâre known\r\nto everyone. That means should ECDSA someday be broken, these outputs could be\r\nstolen.\r\n\r\n2. The length of pubkey (especially uncompressed pubkey) was one of the major reasons that P2PKH was introduced in the first place\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n> First, the public keys are long. â¦ early Bitcoin transactions didnât use the compressed verâ\r\nsions, so the hexadecimal addresses were 130 characters each! This is not fun or easy\r\nfor people to transcribe, much less communicate by voice.\r\n\r\n> Second, the length of the public keys causes a subtler problem: because they have to\r\nbe kept around and indexed to see if the outputs are spendable, the UTXO set\r\nbecomes bigger. This requires more resources on the part of full nodes.\r\n\r\n3. The third point of transaction linkage again links back to the first point. If one had used the same private key to derive multiple pubkey over the ECDSA curve, and if it ever gets compromised, one can easily link the transaction to the same source.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear your thoughts on it. Any points of correction on my understanding of the problem are very appreciated.\r\nThank you.",

This was agreed on when designing Taproot, which is why P2TR outputs also use bare public keys (see [BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_note-2)).\r\n2. Yes, P2PKH has a shorter output script, but overall uses more blockspace than P2PK. It does take less space in the UTXO set, but P2PK only takes one more byte than e.g. P2TR or P2WSH. Note that P2PKH was introduced at a time when compressed keys were not known.\r\n3. A private key can only generate one public key. And again, all output types expose the public key, just some at spending time. This linkage theory doesn't make any sense, and since you aren't sourcing it, I'm assuming it was generated entirely by ChatGPT. (Out of curiosity, I tried asking ChatGPT for the weaknesses in P2PK, and it did indeed include \"enabling easy linkage of transactions\".)\r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions, please post them to [Bitcoin Stack Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/) (where I'll gladly respond). GitHub comments are meant for discussing the code change at hand, not for asking general Bitcoin questions.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to ask you not to use ChatGPT for writing pull request reviews. If I want to know what it'll hallucinate when asked for a review, I can ask it myself.",
