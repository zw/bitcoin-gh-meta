   "body" : "### Monkey Test Feature (MTF)\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\nSay Chad has a Bitcoin wallet and wants to send a large amount of Bitcoins to another wallet. Chad decides to send a smaller test amount first to make sure everything is OK. Chad proceeds to sign and send the transaction, however, the software has two bugs that transmit his entire balance to a wallet that is not under Chads control. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to perform a formal test (what i call a Monkey Test) that leverages the logic of the send utilities with a predefined amount (the minimal amount of Bitcoin one can conceivably send) that way these two theoretical bugs don't wipe out the entire wallet, allowing you to test one piece of functionality in isolation?\r\n\r\nMTF can also stand for M%%%%er F%%%er!, which is what we say when these two bugs compound one another to create total loss of funds when we are also trying to be responsible.\r\n",
