However I don't see how such test transactions would safeguard the sender anyways - if there exists a bug that can send all funds in the wallet to someone else, then making a test transaction could hit that bug and send all funds regardless.\r\n\r\nA better method is to split up the steps of unsigned transaction creation, transaction signing, and transaction broadcast, and inspect the transaction after each step to verify that the transaction is indeed what you want. This can be done with PSBTs. You can create an unsigned transaction with `walletcreatefundedpsbt`. You can inspect the result with `decodepsbt` and check that the output addresses and amounts are what you expect them to be. You can sign by using `walletprocesspsbt` and then result again to make sure it hasn't changed except that signatures have been added. And then you can broadcast using `sendrawtransaction`. There are GUI counterparts for all of these too.",

A standard feature for wallets to test one part of the transaction in isolation (the send to address function) without being impacted by other code that has a dynamic amount for the transaction, would give peace of mind without the complexity of the process you are suggesting.
