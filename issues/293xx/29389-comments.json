However I don't see how such test transactions would safeguard the sender anyways - if there exists a bug that can send all funds in the wallet to someone else, then making a test transaction could hit that bug and send all funds regardless.\r\n\r\nA better method is to split up the steps of unsigned transaction creation, transaction signing, and transaction broadcast, and inspect the transaction after each step to verify that the transaction is indeed what you want. This can be done with PSBTs. You can create an unsigned transaction with `walletcreatefundedpsbt`. You can inspect the result with `decodepsbt` and check that the output addresses and amounts are what you expect them to be. You can sign by using `walletprocesspsbt` and then result again to make sure it hasn't changed except that signatures have been added. And then you can broadcast using `sendrawtransaction`. There are GUI counterparts for all of these too.",

The problem is that if I go to send a test transaction, and one bug is in the amount field, and another is in the recipient field, you could lose all funds for simply trying to test a dust transaction. Wouldn't it be nice if this were mitigated with a test feature in the wallet interface? The idea is that you could test the recipient field with a predefined HARD CODED DUST AMOUNT so that these two bugs don't compound, then you can proceed to use the amount field as well.
