Once this snapshot is loaded, its contents will be deserialized into a second chainstate data structure, which is then used to sync to the network's tip.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile, the original chainstate will complete the initial block download process in the background, eventually validating up to the block that the snapshot is based upon.\r\n\r\n    The result is a usable bitcoind instance that is current with the network tip in a matter of minutes rather than hours. UTXO snapshot are typically obtained via third-party sources (HTTP, torrent, etc.) which is reasonable since their contents are always checked by hash.",
