   "body" : "#24748 added v2 transport to the python `P2PConnection`, but so far each test that wants to make use of it needs to enable it on an individual basis.\r\nThis PR changes it so that if the test suite is run with `--v2transport` option, v2 is used in each test by default, not only for connections between two bitcoind instances as before, but also wherever `P2PConnection` is used. Individual tests can override this global option.\r\n\r\nTo do that, a few tests need to be adjusted, which is done in the first commits.\r\nIn addition, I added a commit disabling a few select subtests that send a large number of large messages (e.g. large reorgs) when `--v2transport` is use. These tests don't have a fundamental problem with v2 but become very slow due to the unoptimised python ChaCha20 implementation (~30 minutes on my computer, so probably not suitable to be run in the CI).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `python3 test_runner.py --v2transport` should succeed and use `v2` everywhere (unless v1 is chosen explicitly).",
