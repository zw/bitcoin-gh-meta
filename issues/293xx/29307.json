   "body" : "1. `fclose(3)` may fail to flush the previously written data to disk, thus a failing `fclose(3)` is as serious as a failing `fwrite(3)`. Previously the code ignored `fclose(3)` failures. This PR improves the explicit callers to check whether it failed. However there is a design issue that `fclose(3)` is also called from the `AutoFile` destructor. There is no good way to signal a failure to the caller from the destructor. Maybe one of:\r\n  1.1. `fflush(3)` after each write to the file (and throw if it fails from the `AutoFile::write()` method) and hope that `fclose(3)` will then always succeed. Assert that it succeeds from the destructor :roll_eyes:. Will hurt performance.\r\n  1.2. Throw nevertheless from the destructor. Exception within the exception in C++ I think results in terminating the program. Better to `assert()` explicitly because it will at least print a meaningful error message before crashing.\r\n  1.3. Only log an error and continue (with a possibly corrupt file :roller_skate:). We don't even know the file name in `AutoFile`.\r\n  1.4. Redesign `AutoFile` so that its destructor cannot fail. Adjust _all_ its users :sob:.\r\n\r\n3. Check for `ferror(3)` after calls to `fread(3)`.",
