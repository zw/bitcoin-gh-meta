Under normal conditions, the value is randomly picked and rounded to 8 decimal positions, however, for this specific case the value is limited to a maximum value that is not properly rounded. If that value happens to be picked, the test will fail.\r\n\r\nI noticed this in a completely unrelated PR where the test failed: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5467779164274688?logs=ci#L2684\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code.

For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review.
