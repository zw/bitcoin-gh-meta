It's still in the new table. So the question would rather be: \"Do we need to retry adding the address to the tried table?\". I guess that's debatable. We're only running into this case very rarely when there's a collision - all other runs test that this works. This should be solved with #29007.\r\n\r\n> Maybe add steps to reproduce the test code?\r\n\r\nYes, I think we should have that. Especially with typos like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28998#discussion_r1416294937. Due to addrman non-determinism, this isn't really doable. Again, #29007 helps here. \r\n",
