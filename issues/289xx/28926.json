   "body" : "This picks up #27534 with a rebase and a few fixups, now squashed. See #27534 for more background information.\r\n\r\nConsiderations from the previous draft:\r\n\r\n> Should we allow dimensions to be rearraged?\r\n> \r\n> When it comes time to gather up the RPC results, @vasild has provided an [alternate implementation](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/commits/getnetmsgstats) that uses an array instead of the MultiMap structure. This results in two changes:\r\n> \r\n>> using the stack over the heap (yay!)\r\n>> enforcing a strict ordering of dimensions (direction, network, connection type, message type)\r\n> \r\n> Aside from being good for memory, the reasoning here is allowing users to rearrange dimensions may be too confusing. I personally really like the ability to rearrange dimensions, which is why I have not integrated that solution into this PR, but am open to whatever the larger community prefers :) [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#issue-1685662150)\r\n\r\n^ I have looked at the alternative implementation (thanks @vasild!), but prefer the current version myself so long as the performance is not an issue. I've left this as-is for now. If folks here think that it might be an issue then I can investigate the alternative further. See the next consideration for additional reasoning on sticking with the current approach.\r\n\r\n> Now that an effort has been made to remove the friendship between CConnman and CNode (see this PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257) I'm unsure if this (recording network stats on a CConnman object) belongs here. [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1179508199)\r\n\r\n^ These changes make @valid's alternative approach a bit harder to rebase and AB test with the current approach, as it relied on access to the `CNode` msg queue, and #27257 included the change: \"CNode's message processing queue is made private in the process and its mutex is turned into a non-recursive mutex.\" It can be worked around, but I'm not convinced it will be worth it.\r\n\r\n> this function should handle if index > NUM_NET_MESSAGE_TYPES [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1191793368)\r\n\r\n^ I took this suggestion as part in 800ec2ac762cb48ac667cdf04de263634404569e\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1191798171\r\n\r\n^ I refactored this array in c909dc5704465aa96ce4496ed14452719e0b7860 to make it more comprehensible in the source code.\r\n\r\nAdditional considerations from OP:\r\n\r\n* The code organisation was mainly taken care of by @satsie, with _src/netstats.{h\\|cpp}_ now code from the netstats namespace instead of being contained within _net.cpp_\r\n",
