   "body" : "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- There are various pinning problems with RBF and our general ancestor/descendant limits. These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #25038 which implements package RBF on top of this). [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy [3] allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. The \"cluster limit\" allows us to do things like calculate the \"miner score\" of a transaction and permit below-minrelayfeerate transactions.\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html, https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will continue to use this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html",
