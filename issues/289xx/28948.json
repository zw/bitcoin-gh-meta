These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #28984 which implements package RBF on top of this). I would focus the most here on Rule 3 pinning. [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy is for \"Priority Transactions.\" [3][4] It allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions, in exchange for the more robust fee-bumping abilities that offers. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2.\r\n\r\nImmediate benefits:\r\n\r\n- You can presign a transaction with 0 fees (not just 1sat/vB!) and add a fee-bump later.\r\n- Rule 3 pinning is reduced by a significant amount, since the attacker can only attach a maximum of 1000vB to your shared transaction.\r\n \r\nThis also enables some other cool things (again see #27463 for overall roadmap):\r\n- Ephemeral Anchors\r\n- Package RBF for these 1-parent-1-child packages. That means e.g. a commitment tx + child can replace another commitment tx using the child's fees.\r\n- We can transition to a \"single anchor\" universe without worrying about package limit pinning. So current users of CPFP carve out would have something else to use.\r\n- We can switch to a cluster-based mempool [5] (#27677 #28676), which removes CPFP carve out [6].\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will still want this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html\r\n[4]: Original PR #25038 also contains a lot of the discussion\r\n[5]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/7\r\n[6]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12",
