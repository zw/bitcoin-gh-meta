      "body" : "So thinking conceptually about this, I'm most concerned by the new `CheckMinerScores()` criterion, where we only check the replacement package's feerate against the ancestor feerates of the indirect conflicts.\r\n\r\nI think there are two issues with this approach:\r\n1) If you look at `GetModFeesWithAncestors()/GetSizeWithAncestors()`, that can be greater than the transaction's individual feerate (ie if the parent of a transaction has a higher feerate than the child you're conflicting with). So this can cause the test to be too conservative and introduce some kind of weird pinning.  Granted, this is a new replacement functionality so maybe not the end of the world if it is sometimes too conservative, but it seems like a bug.\r\n\r\n2) Also if you look at the ancestor feerate of a transaction, that can underestimate its mining score, such as if some low feerate ancestor is being paid for by another transaction.  So that can allow for replacements that are not incentive compatible (similar to how this is possible today with our current single-transaction RBF rules).\r\n\r\nEven though the current RBF logic is broken already, I'd prefer to avoid adding on to that while rolling out the package RBF implementation, just so that users don't get used to some kinds of replacements working that really shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering, can we deal with this by just restricting the topology of what we allow a package RBF to conflict with?  Let's say we allow a replacement if the conflict set consists of either (1) a single transaction with no ancestors (and of course no descendants, since any descendants would be in the conflict set as well), or (2) two transactions that are in a parent-child topology, and that have no other in-mempool ancestors (or descendants, of course).\r\n\r\nIn those situations, the maximum miner score you would have to consider is either the individual feerate of the parent tx or the ancestor feerate of the child, so the new logic should work perfectly.",

This allows us to calculate mining scores for each conflicted transaction, which means that post-cluster mempool, if we did this right, IIUC, the behavior should match with more general package RBF.",

For transactions in a cluster of size <= 2, min(feerate, ancestor feerate) exactly captures the mining score of a transaction.\r\n\r\nDid I miss anything?",

      "body" : "I was trying to figure out exactly why this code is safe in a package RBF context. I think for a generalized package RBF, this would not be safe, because we do not verify that a child transaction in an incoming package (say) isn't spending a coin in the mempool that would be conflicted by some other transaction in the package.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this particular case, we are enforcing in `PackageMempoolChecks()` (further down) that the incoming package has **no** other in-mempool ancestors (ie the new package is a cluster of size 2), and so I think that condition is what precludes the scenario I'm concerned about above.  (Specifically: if, say, we allowed the incoming package to have 1 in-mempool ancestor A, then it's possible that a package could consist of transactions (P, C) such that P spent one of A's outputs, while transaction C conflicted with A, which I don't think would be caught anywhere right now.)\r\n\r\nIf my understanding here is correct, I think it'd be worth updating the comment to explain this a bit more (and perhaps we could add a test that covers the scenario I described).",

The mempool might not be made \"strictly better\", in the sense that there are more fees available for every size of transactions selected, using the RBF criteria in this PR.  (I'm trying to figure out if there are any simple heuristics we can apply to resolve this issue.)\r\n\r\n2. It occurred to me that users might run into a problem if they submit a package (A, B), where B has in-mempool conflicts and A does not, if A would relay fine on its own.  Consider this scenario:\r\n   -  node receives package (A, B), either via submitpackage or a future package-relay protocol\r\n   - node applies the package RBF rules here and accepts the package \r\n   - node announces transactions A and B to peers \r\n   - a peer downloads the transactions separately\r\n   - the peer validates tx A, and it makes it into the mempool on its own (perhaps it itself had no conflicts and satisfied min fee requirements)\r\n   - the peer validates tx B and rejects it, because under single-tx-rbf rules, B is an invalid replacement (it has a new unconfirmed input compared with what it conflicts with, namely tx A)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the only solution for issue 2 would be to somehow ensure that tx A would not be eligible for relay on its own.  Are there any better ideas?",
