Instead I threaded through the max fee argument and used that directly via ATMPArgs.\r\n\r\nThe implication here is that subpackages can be submitted to the mempool prior to hitting this new error condition. Therefore you'd likely want https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28848 which would give detailed results of what made it in, versus what didn't.",
