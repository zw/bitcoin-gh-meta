We should figure out how to support them\r\n\r\n\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n`maxfeerate`: this one is a bit tricky. I think the easiest way would be have a utility function that pulls in utxos to create the sigops-adjusted vsizes and individual fees? Then the entire package could be rejected if any exceed the set amount.\r\n\r\n`maxburnamount`: This can be added on without any chain-context by scanning the outputs of each transaction and rejecting the package if any exceed the value.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
