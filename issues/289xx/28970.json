   "body" : "Draft for now while working on other things. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- Package relay is nice [1]. Relaying 1-parent-1-child CPFP when mempool min feerate is high would be a subset of the use cases, but a pretty significant improvement over what we have today.\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n- The majority of this code is useful for building e.g. #27742.\r\n\r\nThis means 1p1c packages propagate in the \"happy case\" where nobody is deliberately withholding packages. To make this more robust, we need receiver-side logic to retry orphan resolution with multiple peers. Also, since we rely on the orphanage to remember the child while waiting for the parent, peers may cause us to drop packages by sending lots of orphans. To make this robust, we need to make efforts to protect some amount of orphans from eviction.\r\n\r\n[1]: see this writeup and its links https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/02ec218c7857ef60914e9a3d383b68caf987f70b/bip-0331.mediawiki#propagate-high-feerate-transactions",
