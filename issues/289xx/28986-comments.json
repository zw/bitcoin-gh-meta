Don't think it is a hardware issue or I would think there would be other problems as well and there are not.\r\n\r\n-tindex is off\r\n\r\nThe transaction is not one in my wallet, just a random tx from the network I picked off the block explorer, I was doing some testing and picked it just to have a look at the transaction structure as reported by the daemon. In hindsight, because it was a recent tx, it must have been in the mempool.\r\n\r\nFirst attempt with \"verbosity\" not set and then with \"verbosity\" set = 1 went smoothly\r\nBlew up when \"verbosity\" set = 2\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing that in between those two requests the tx exited the mempool but the rpc command did not notice or did not check that it was not present and executed something with a missing/corrupted pointer.\r\n\r\nAfter restarting the daemon and since then including now, the rpc command correctly tells me that:\r\n\"No such mempool transaction. Use -txindex or provide a block hash to enable blockchain transaction queries. Use gettransaction for wallet transactions.\"\r\n\r\nSo it looks like a software bug in \"rawtransaction.cpp\" or one of the calls used.\r\n\r\nI think there is small window in node/transaction.cpp for a slip up. Maybe my analysis misses something\r\n\r\nfor \"verbosity\" = 2\r\nin rawtransaction.cpp around line 280 we have\r\n    const CTransactionRef tx = GetTransaction(blockindex, node.mempool.get(), hash, chainman.GetConsensus(), hash_block);\r\n\r\nhowever, in node/transaction.cpp around line 127\r\n    if (mempool && !block_index) {\r\n        CTransactionRef ptx = mempool->get(hash);\r\n        if (ptx) return ptx;\r\n    }\r\nThere is the opportunity to return without setting hashBlock (hash_block in rawtransaction.cpp)\r\n\r\nhash_block should be checked for NULLPTR prior to this I think\r\n\r\nwhen \"verbosity\" = 2, that allows the code to fall all the way to TxToJSON with a bad pointer in hash_block where it will not do the right thing.\r\n",
