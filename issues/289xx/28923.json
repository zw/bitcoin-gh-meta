   "body" : "This PR is a small performance improvement on the `SignTransaction` function, which is used mostly by the wallet (obviously) and the `signrawtransactionwithkey` RPC. The lower-level function `ProduceSignature` already calls `VerifyScript` internally as last step in order to check whether the signature data is complete:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/daa56f7f665183bcce3df146f143be37f33c123e/src/script/sign.cpp#L568-L570\r\n\r\nIf and only if that is the case, the `complete` field of the `SignatureData` is set to `true` accordingly and there is no need then to verify the script after again, as we already know that it would succeed.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rough ~20% speed-up for `SignTransaction` for single-input ECDSA or Taproot inputs, according to the newly introduced `SignTransaction{ECDSA,Taproot}` benchmarks. Note that there are already signing benchmarks in the secp256k1 library, but `SignTransaction` does much more than just the cryptographical parts, i.e.:\r\n* calculate the unsigned tx's `PrecomputedTransactionData` if necessary\r\n* apply Solver on the prevout scriptPubKey, fetch the relevant keys from the signing provider\r\n* perform the actual signing operation (for ECDSA signatures, that could be more than once due to low-R grinding)\r\n* verify if the signatures are correct by calling `VerifyScript`\r\n\r\nso it probably makes sense to also have benchmarks from that higher-level application perspective.",
