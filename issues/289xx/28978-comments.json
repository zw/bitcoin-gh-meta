The existing design has integrated functionality like P2P network operations, wallet management, and a GUI into a single executable. While effective, it has limitations in flexibility, security, and scalability. This project introduces changes that transition Bitcoin Core to a more modular architecture. It aims to enhance security, improve usability, and facilitate maintenance and development of the software.\n+\n+## Current Architecture\n+\n+The current system features two primary executables: `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt`. `bitcoind` combines a Bitcoin P2P node with an integrated JSON-RPC server, wallet, and indexes. `bitcoin-qt` extends this by incorporating a Qt-based GUI. This monolithic structure, although robust, presents challenges such as limited operational flexibility and increased security risks due to the tight integration of components.\n+\n+## Proposed Architecture\n+\n+The new architecture divides the existing code into three specialized executables:\n+\n+- `bitcoin-node`: Manages the node, indexes, and JSON-RPC server.\n+- `bitcoin-wallet`: Handles all wallet functionality.\n+- `bitcoin-gui`: Provides a standalone Qt-based GUI.\n+\n+This modular approach is designed to enhance security through component isolation and improve usability by allowing independent operation of each module. This allows for new use-cases, such as running the node on a dedicated machine and operating wallets and GUIs on separate machines with the flexibility to start and stop them as needed.\n+\n+This subdivision could be extended in the future. For example, indexes could be removed from the `bitcoin-node` executable and run in separate executables. And JSON-RPC servers could be added to wallet and index executables, so they can listen and respond to RPC requests on their own ports, without needing to forward RPC requests through `bitcoin-node`.\n+\n+## Component Overview: Navigating the IPC Framework\n+\n+This section describes the major components of the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) framework covering the relevant source files, generated files, tools, and libraries.\n+\n+### Abstract C++ Classes in [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/)\n+- The foundation of the IPC implementation lies in the abstract C++ classes within the [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/) directory. These classes define pure virtual methods that code in [`src/node/`](../../src/node/), [`src/wallet/`](../../src/wallet/), and [`src/qt/`](../../src/qt/) directories call to interact with each other.\n+- Each abstract class in this directory represents a distinct interface that the different modules (node, wallet, GUI) implement and use for cross-process communication.\n+- The classes are written following conventions described in [Internal Interface\n+  Guidelines](../developer-notes.md#internal-interface-guidelines) to ensure\n+  compatibility with Cap'n Proto.\n+\n+### Capân Proto Files in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/)\n+- Corresponding to each abstract class, there are `.capnp` files within the [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/) directory. These files are used as input to the `mpgen` tool (described below) to generate C++ code.\n+- These Capân Proto files ([learn more about Cap'n Proto RPC](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html)) define the structure and format of messages that are exchanged over IPC. They serve as blueprints for generating C++ code that bridges the gap between high-level C++ interfaces and low-level socket communication.\n+\n+### The `mpgen` Code Generation Tool\n+- A central component of the IPC framework is the `mpgen` tool which is part the [`libmultiprocess` project](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess). This tool takes the `.capnp` files as input and generates C++ code.\n+- The generated code handles IPC communication, translating interface calls into socket reads and writes.\n+\n+### C++ Client Subclasses in Generated Code\n+- In the generated code, we have C++ client subclasses that inherit from the abstract classes in [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/). These subclasses are the workhorses of the IPC mechanism.\n+- They implement all the methods of the interface, marshalling arguments into a structured format, sending them as requests to the IPC server via a UNIX socket, and handling the responses.\n+- These subclasses effectively mask the complexity of IPC, presenting a familiar C++ interface to developers.\n+- Internally, the client subclasses generated by the `mpgen` tool wrap [client classes generated by Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#clients), and use them to send IPC requests.\n+\n+### C++ Server Classes in Generated Code\n+- On the server side, corresponding generated C++ classes receive IPC requests. These server classes are responsible for unmarshalling method arguments, invoking the corresponding methods in the local [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/) objects, and creating the IPC response.\n+- The server classes ensure that return values (including output argument values and thrown exceptions) are marshalled and sent back to the client, completing the communication cycle.\n+- Internally, the server subclasses generated by the `mpgen` tool inherit from [server classes generated by Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#servers), and use them to process IPC requests.\n+\n+### The `libmultiprocess` Runtime Library\n+- **Core Functionality**: The `libmultiprocess` runtime library's primary function is to instantiate the generated client and server classes as needed.\n+- **Bootstrapping IPC Connections**: It provides functions for starting new IPC connections, specifically binding generated client and server classes for an initial `interfaces::Init` interface (defined in [`src/interfaces/init.h`](../../src/interfaces/init.h)) to a UNIX socket. This initial interface has methods returning other interfaces that different Bitcoin-Core modules use to communicate after the bootstrapping phase.\n+- **Asynchronous I/O and Thread Management**: The library is also responsible for managing I/O and threading. Particularly, it ensures that IPC requests never block each other and that new threads on either side of a connection can always make client calls. It also manages worker threads on the server side of calls, ensuring that calls from the same client thread always execute on the same server thread (to avoid locking issues and support nested callbacks).\n+\n+### Type Hooks in [`src/ipc/capnp/*-types.h`](../../src/ipc/capnp/)\n+- **Custom Type Conversions**: In [`src/ipc/capnp/*-types.h`](../../src/ipc/capnp/), multiple function overloads of two `libmultiprocess` C++ functions, `mp::CustomReadField` and `mp::CustomBuildFields`, are defined. These functions are used for customizing the conversion of specific C++ types to and from Capân Proto types.\n+- **Handling Special Cases**: The `mpgen` tool and `libmultiprocess` library can convert most C++ types to and from Capân Proto types automatically, including interface types, primitive C++ types, standard C++ types like `std::vector`, `std::set`, `std::map`, `std::tuple`, and `std::function`, as well as simple C++ structs that consist of afforementioned types and whose fields correspond 1:1 with Capân Proto struct fields. For other types, `*-types.h` files provide custom code to convert between C++ and Capân Proto data representations.\n+\n+### Protocol-Agnostic IPC Code in [`src/ipc/`](../../src/ipc/)\n+- **Broad Applicability**: Unlike the Capân Proto-specific code in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/), the code in the [`src/ipc/`](../../src/ipc/) directory is protocol-agnostic. This enables potential support for other protocols, such as gRPC or a custom protocol in the future.\n+- **Process Management and Socket Operations**: The main purpose of this component is to provide functions for spawning new processes and creating and connecting to UNIX sockets.\n+- **ipc::Exception Class**: This code also defines an `ipc::Exception` class which is thrown from the generated C++ client class methods when there is an unexpected IPC error, such as a disconnection.\n+\n+## Design Considerations\n+\n+### Selection of Capân Proto\n+The choice to use [Capân Proto](https://capnproto.org/) for IPC was primarily influenced by its support for passing object references and managing object lifetimes, which would have to be implemented manually with a framework that only supported plain requests and responses like [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The support is especially helpful for passing callback objects like `std::function` and supporting bidirectional communication.\n+\n+The choice to use an RPC framework at all instead of a custom protocol was neccesitated by the size of Bitcoin Core internal interfaces which consist of around 150 methods that pass complex data structures and are called in complicated ways (in parallel, from callbacks that can be nested and stored). Writing a custom protocol to wrap these complicated interfaces would be too much work, akin to writing a new RPC framework.\n+\n+### Hiding IPC\n+\n+The IPC mechanism is deliberately isolated from the rest of the codebase so less code has to be concerned with IPC.\n+\n+Building Bitcoin Core with IPC support is optional, and the same code can be compiled to either run in the same process or separate processes. The build system also ensures Capân Proto library headers can only be used within the [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/) directory, not in other parts of the codebase.\n+\n+The libmultiprocess runtime is designed to place as few constraints as possible on IPC interfaces and make IPC calls act like normal function calls. Method arguments, return values, and exceptions are automatically serialized and sent between processes. Object references and `std::function` arguments are automatically tracked and mapped to allow invoked code to call back into invoking code at any time. And there is a 1:1 threading model where any every client thread has a corresponding server thread responsible for executing incoming calls from that thread (there can be multiple calls from the same thread due to callbacks), without blocking, and holding the same thread-local variables and locks so behavior is the same whether IPC is used or not.\n+\n+### Interface Definition Maintenance\n+\n+The choice to maintain interface definitions and C++ type mappings as `.capnp` files in the [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/) was mostly done for convenience, and probably something that could be improved in the future.\n+\n+In the current design, class names, method names, and parameter names are duplicated between C++ interfaces in [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/) and Capân Proto files in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/). While this keeps C++ interface headers simple and free of references to IPC, it is a maintence burden because it means inconsistencies between C++ declarations and Capân Proto declarations will result in compile errors. (Static type checking ensures these are not runtime errors.)\n+\n+An alternate approach could use custom [C++ Attributes](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes) embedded in interface declarations to automatically generate `.capnp` files directly from C++ headers. This has not been pursued because parsing C++ headers is a more complicated than parsing Capân Proto interface definitions, especially portably on multiple platforms.\n+\n+### Interface Stability\n+\n+The currently defined IPC interfaces are unstable, and can change freely with no backwards compatibility. The decision to allow this stems from the recognition that our current interfaces are still evolving and not yet ideal for external use. As these interfaces mature and become more refined, there may be an opportunity to declare them stable and use Capân Proto's support for protocol evolution ([Cap'n Proto - Evolving Your Protocol](https://capnproto.org/language.html#evolving-your-protocol)) to allow them to be extended while remaining backwards compatible. This could allow different versions of node, GUI, and wallet binaries to interoperate, and potentially open doors for external tools to utilize these interfaces, such as creating custom indexes through a stable indexing interface. However, for now, the priority is to improve the interfaces internally. Given their current state and the advantages of using JSON-RPC for most common tasks, it's more practical to focus on internal development rather than external applicability.\n+\n+## Example Use Cases and Flows\n+\n+### Retrieving a Block Hash\n+\n+Letâs walk through an example where the `bitcoin-wallet` process requests the hash of a block at a specific height from the `bitcoin-node` process. This example demonstrates the practical application of the IPC mechanism, specifically the interplay between C++ method calls and Capân Proto-generated RPC calls.\n+\n+1. **Initiation in bitcoin-wallet**\n+   - The wallet process calls the `getBlockHash` method on a `Chain` object. This method is defined as a virtual function in [`src/interfaces/chain.h`](../../src/interfaces/chain.h).\n+\n+2. **Translation to Capân Proto RPC**\n+   - The call to `getBlockHash` is translated into a Capân Proto RPC call. This translation is handled by code automatically generated by the `mpgen` tool, based on the [`chain.capnp`](../../src/ipc/capnp/chain.capnp)` file in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/).\n+\n+3. **Request Preparation and Dispatch**\n+   - The generated `Chain` subclass in `bitcoin-wallet` populates a Capân Proto request with the `height` parameter.\n+   - The request is sent to the `bitcoin-node` process.\n+\n+4. **Handling in bitcoin-node**\n+   - Upon receiving the request, the `bitcoin-node` process reads the `height` value from the request.\n+   - It then calls the `getBlockHash` method on its local `Chain` object with the provided `height`.\n+\n+5. **Response and Return**\n+   - The `bitcoin-node` process takes the `getBlockHash` return value, encapsulates it in a Capân Proto response, and sends it back to the `bitcoin-wallet` process.\n+   - The `bitcoin-wallet` process receives the response, extracts the block hash value, and returns it to the original caller.\n+\n+## Future Enhancements\n+\n+Further improvements are possible such as:\n+\n+- Separating indexes from `bitcoin-node`, and running indexing code in separate processes.\n+- Enabling wallet processes to listen for JSON-RPC requests on their own ports instead of needing the node process to listen and forward requests to them.\n+- Automatically generating `.capnp` files from C++ interface definitions (see [Interface Definition Maintenance](#interface-definition-maintenance))\n+- Simplifying and stabilizing interfaces (see [Interface Stability](#interface-stability))\n+- Adding sandbox features, restricting subprocess access to resources and data (see [https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin](https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin)).",

But internally (after [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102)), `bitcoin-gui` will spawn a `bitcoin-node` process to run P2P and RPC code, communicating with it across a socket pair, and `bitcoin-node` will spawn `bitcoin-wallet` to run wallet code, also communicating over a socket pair. This will let node, wallet, and GUI code run in separate address spaces for better isolation, and allow future improvements like being able to start and stop components independently on different machines and environments.\n-\n-## Next steps\n-\n-Specific next steps after [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) will be:\n-\n-- [ ] Adding `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options to `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables so they can listen and connect to TCP ports and unix socket paths. This will allow separate processes to be started and stopped any time and connect to each other.\n-- [ ] Adding `-server` and `-rpcbind` options to the `bitcoin-wallet` executable so wallet processes can handle RPC requests directly without going through the node.\n-- [ ] Supporting windows, not just unix systems. The existing socket code is already cross-platform, so the only windows-specific code that needs to be written is code spawning a process and passing a socket descriptor. This can be implemented with `CreateProcess` and `WSADuplicateSocket`. Example: https://memset.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/win32-api-passing-socket-with-ipc-method/.\n-- [ ] Adding sandbox features, restricting subprocess access to resources and data.

A simple way to get starting using it without installing these dependencies manually is to use the [depends system](../../depends) with the `MULTIPROCESS=1` [dependency option](../../depends#dependency-options) passed to make:\n-\n-```\n-cd <BITCOIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>\n-make -C depends NO_QT=1 MULTIPROCESS=1\n-CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/share/config.site ./configure\n-make\n-src/bitcoin-node -regtest -printtoconsole -debug=ipc\n-BITCOIND=bitcoin-node test/functional/test_runner.py\n-```\n-\n-The configure script will pick up settings and library locations from the depends directory, so there is no need to pass `--enable-multiprocess` as a separate flag when using the depends system (it's controlled by the `MULTIPROCESS=1` option).\n-\n-Alternately, you can install [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) and [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) packages on your system, and just run `./configure --enable-multiprocess` without using the depends system. The configure script will be able to locate the installed packages via [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/). See [Installation](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/master/doc/install.md) section of the libmultiprocess readme for install steps. See [build-unix.md](../build-unix.md) and [build-osx.md](../build-osx.md) for information about installing dependencies in general.\n-\n-## IPC implementation details\n-\n-Cross process Node, Wallet, and Chain interfaces are defined in\n-[`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/). These are C++ classes which follow\n-[conventions](../developer-notes.md#internal-interface-guidelines), like passing\n-serializable arguments so they can be called from different processes, and\n-making methods pure virtual so they can have proxy implementations that forward\n-calls between processes.\n-\n-When Wallet, Node, and Chain code is running in the same process, calling any\n-interface method invokes the implementation directly. When code is running in\n-different processes, calling an interface method invokes a proxy interface\n-implementation that communicates with a remote process and invokes the real\n-implementation in the remote process.

The existing design has integrated functionality like P2P network operations, wallet management, and a GUI into a single executable. While effective, it has limitations in flexibility, security, and scalability. This project introduces changes that transition Bitcoin Core to a more modular architecture. It aims to enhance security, improve usability, and facilitate maintenance and development of the software.\n+\n+## Current Architecture\n+\n+The current system features two primary executables: `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt`. `bitcoind` combines a Bitcoin P2P node with an integrated JSON-RPC server, wallet, and indexes. `bitcoin-qt` extends this by incorporating a Qt-based GUI. This monolithic structure, although robust, presents challenges such as limited operational flexibility and increased security risks due to the tight integration of components.\n+\n+## Proposed Architecture\n+\n+The new architecture divides the existing code into three specialized executables:\n+\n+- `bitcoin-node`: Manages the node, indexes, and JSON-RPC server.\n+- `bitcoin-wallet`: Handles all wallet functionality.\n+- `bitcoin-gui`: Provides a standalone Qt-based GUI.\n+\n+This modular approach is designed to enhance security through component isolation and improve usability by allowing independent operation of each module. This allows for new use-cases, such as running the node on a dedicated machine and operating wallets and GUIs on separate machines with the flexibility to start and stop them as needed.\n+\n+This subdivision could be extended in the future. For example, indexes could be removed from the `bitcoin-node` executable and run in separate executables. And JSON-RPC servers could be added to wallet and index executables, so they can listen and respond to RPC requests on their own ports, without needing to forward RPC requests through `bitcoin-node`.\n+\n+## Component Overview: Navigating the IPC Framework\n+\n+This section describes the major components of the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) framework covering the relevant source files, generated files, tools, and libraries.\n+\n+### Abstract C++ Classes in [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/)\n+- The foundation of the IPC implementation lies in the abstract C++ classes within the [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/) directory. These classes define pure virtual methods that code in [`src/node/`](../../src/node/), [`src/wallet/`](../../src/wallet/), and [`src/qt/`](../../src/qt/) directories call to interact with each other.\n+- Each abstract class in this directory represents a distinct interface that the different modules (node, wallet, GUI) implement and use for cross-process communication.\n+- The classes are written following conventions described in [Internal Interface\n+  Guidelines](../developer-notes.md#internal-interface-guidelines) to ensure\n+  compatibility with Cap'n Proto.\n+\n+### Capân Proto Files in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/)\n+- Corresponding to each abstract class, there are `.capnp` files within the [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/) directory. These files are used as input to the `mpgen` tool (described below) to generate C++ code.\n+- These Capân Proto files ([learn more about Cap'n Proto RPC](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html)) define the structure and format of messages that are exchanged over IPC. They serve as blueprints for generating C++ code that bridges the gap between high-level C++ interfaces and low-level socket communication.\n+\n+### The `mpgen` Code Generation Tool\n+- A central component of the IPC framework is the `mpgen` tool which is part the [`libmultiprocess` project](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess). This tool takes the `.capnp` files as input and generates C++ code.\n+- The generated code handles IPC communication, translating interface calls into socket reads and writes.\n+\n+### C++ Client Subclasses in Generated Code\n+- In the generated code, we have C++ client subclasses that inherit from the abstract classes in [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/). These subclasses are the workhorses of the IPC mechanism.\n+- They implement all the methods of the interface, marshalling arguments into a structured format, sending them as requests to the IPC server via a UNIX socket, and handling the responses.\n+- These subclasses effectively mask the complexity of IPC, presenting a familiar C++ interface to developers.\n+- Internally, the client subclasses generated by the `mpgen` tool wrap [client classes generated by Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#clients), and use them to send IPC requests.\n+\n+### C++ Server Classes in Generated Code\n+- On the server side, corresponding generated C++ classes receive IPC requests. These server classes are responsible for unmarshalling method arguments, invoking the corresponding methods in the local [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/) objects, and creating the IPC response.\n+- The server classes ensure that return values (including output argument values and thrown exceptions) are marshalled and sent back to the client, completing the communication cycle.\n+- Internally, the server subclasses generated by the `mpgen` tool inherit from [server classes generated by Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#servers), and use them to process IPC requests.\n+\n+### The `libmultiprocess` Runtime Library\n+- **Core Functionality**: The `libmultiprocess` runtime library's primary function is to instantiate the generated client and server classes as needed.\n+- **Bootstrapping IPC Connections**: It provides functions for starting new IPC connections, specifically binding generated client and server classes for an initial `interfaces::Init` interface (defined in [`src/interfaces/init.h`](../../src/interfaces/init.h)) to a UNIX socket. This initial interface has methods returning other interfaces that different Bitcoin-Core modules use to communicate after the bootstrapping phase.\n+- **Asynchronous I/O and Thread Management**: The library is also responsible for managing I/O and threading. Particularly, it ensures that IPC requests never block each other and that new threads on either side of a connection can always make client calls. It also manages worker threads on the server side of calls, ensuring that calls from the same client thread always execute on the same server thread (to avoid locking issues and support nested callbacks).\n+\n+### Type Hooks in [`src/ipc/capnp/*-types.h`](../../src/ipc/capnp/)\n+- **Custom Type Conversions**: In [`src/ipc/capnp/*-types.h`](../../src/ipc/capnp/), multiple function overloads of two `libmultiprocess` C++ functions, `mp::CustomReadField` and `mp::CustomBuildFields`, are defined. These functions are used for customizing the conversion of specific C++ types to and from Capân Proto types.\n+- **Handling Special Cases**: The `mpgen` tool and `libmultiprocess` library can convert most C++ types to and from Capân Proto types automatically, including interface types, primitive C++ types, standard C++ types like `std::vector`, `std::set`, `std::map`, `std::tuple`, and `std::function`, as well as simple C++ structs that consist of afforementioned types and whose fields correspond 1:1 with Capân Proto struct fields. For other types, `*-types.h` files provide custom code to convert between C++ and Capân Proto data representations.\n+\n+### Protocol-Agnostic IPC Code in [`src/ipc/`](../../src/ipc/)\n+- **Broad Applicability**: Unlike the Capân Proto-specific code in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/), the code in the [`src/ipc/`](../../src/ipc/) directory is protocol-agnostic. This enables potential support for other protocols, such as gRPC or a custom protocol in the future.\n+- **Process Management and Socket Operations**: The main purpose of this component is to provide functions for spawning new processes and creating and connecting to UNIX sockets.\n+- **ipc::Exception Class**: This code also defines an `ipc::Exception` class which is thrown from the generated C++ client class methods when there is an unexpected IPC error, such as a disconnection.\n+\n+## Design Considerations\n+\n+### Selection of Capân Proto\n+The choice to use [Capân Proto](https://capnproto.org/) for IPC was primarily influenced by its support for passing object references and managing object lifetimes, which would have to be implemented manually with a framework that only supported plain requests and responses like [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The support is especially helpful for passing callback objects like `std::function` and supporting bidirectional communication.\n+\n+The choice to use an RPC framework at all instead of a custom protocol was neccesitated by the size of Bitcoin Core internal interfaces which consist of around 150 methods that pass complex data structures and are called in complicated ways (in parallel, from callbacks that can be nested and stored). Writing a custom protocol to wrap these complicated interfaces would be too much work, akin to writing a new RPC framework.\n+\n+### Hiding IPC\n+\n+The IPC mechanism is deliberately isolated from the rest of the codebase so less code has to be concerned with IPC.\n+\n+Building Bitcoin Core with IPC support is optional, and the same code can be compiled to either run in the same process or separate processes. The build system also ensures Capân Proto library headers can only be used within the [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/) directory, not in other parts of the codebase.\n+\n+The libmultiprocess runtime is designed to place as few constraints as possible on IPC interfaces and make IPC calls act like normal function calls. Method arguments, return values, and exceptions are automatically serialized and sent between processes. Object references and `std::function` arguments are automatically tracked and mapped to allow invoked code to call back into invoking code at any time. And there is a 1:1 threading model where any every client thread has a corresponding server thread responsible for executing incoming calls from that thread (there can be multiple calls from the same thread due to callbacks), without blocking, and holding the same thread-local variables and locks so behavior is the same whether IPC is used or not.\n+\n+### Interface Definition Maintenance\n+\n+The choice to maintain interface definitions and C++ type mappings as `.capnp` files in the [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/) was mostly done for convenience, and probably something that could be improved in the future.\n+\n+In the current design, class names, method names, and parameter names are duplicated between C++ interfaces in [`src/interfaces/`](../../src/interfaces/) and Capân Proto files in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/). While this keeps C++ interface headers simple and free of references to IPC, it is a maintence burden because it means inconsistencies between C++ declarations and Capân Proto declarations will result in compile errors. (Static type checking ensures these are not runtime errors.)\n+\n+An alternate approach could use custom [C++ Attributes](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes) embedded in interface declarations to automatically generate `.capnp` files directly from C++ headers. This has not been pursued because parsing C++ headers is a more complicated than parsing Capân Proto interface definitions, especially portably on multiple platforms.\n+\n+### Interface Stability\n+\n+The currently defined IPC interfaces are unstable, and can change freely with no backwards compatibility. The decision to allow this stems from the recognition that our current interfaces are still evolving and not yet ideal for external use. As these interfaces mature and become more refined, there may be an opportunity to declare them stable and use Capân Proto's support for protocol evolution ([Cap'n Proto - Evolving Your Protocol](https://capnproto.org/language.html#evolving-your-protocol)) to allow them to be extended while remaining backwards compatible. This could allow different versions of node, GUI, and wallet binaries to interoperate, and potentially open doors for external tools to utilize these interfaces, such as creating custom indexes through a stable indexing interface. However, for now, the priority is to improve the interfaces internally. Given their current state and the advantages of using JSON-RPC for most common tasks, it's more practical to focus on internal development rather than external applicability.\n+\n+## Example Use Cases and Flows\n+\n+### Retrieving a Block Hash\n+\n+Letâs walk through an example where the `bitcoin-wallet` process requests the hash of a block at a specific height from the `bitcoin-node` process. This example demonstrates the practical application of the IPC mechanism, specifically the interplay between C++ method calls and Capân Proto-generated RPC calls.\n+\n+1. **Initiation in bitcoin-wallet**\n+   - The wallet process calls the `getBlockHash` method on a `Chain` object. This method is defined as a virtual function in [`src/interfaces/chain.h`](../../src/interfaces/chain.h).\n+\n+2. **Translation to Capân Proto RPC**\n+   - The call to `getBlockHash` is translated into a Capân Proto RPC call. This translation is handled by code automatically generated by the `mpgen` tool, based on the [`chain.capnp`](../../src/ipc/capnp/chain.capnp)` file in [`src/ipc/capnp/`](../../src/ipc/capnp/).\n+\n+3. **Request Preparation and Dispatch**\n+   - The generated `Chain` subclass in `bitcoin-wallet` populates a Capân Proto request with the `height` parameter.\n+   - The request is sent to the `bitcoin-node` process.\n+\n+4. **Handling in bitcoin-node**\n+   - Upon receiving the request, the `bitcoin-node` process reads the `height` value from the request.\n+   - It then calls the `getBlockHash` method on its local `Chain` object with the provided `height`.\n+\n+5. **Response and Return**\n+   - The `bitcoin-node` process takes the `getBlockHash` return value, encapsulates it in a Capân Proto response, and sends it back to the `bitcoin-wallet` process.\n+   - The `bitcoin-wallet` process receives the response, extracts the block hash value, and returns it to the original caller.\n+\n+## Future Enhancements\n+\n+Further improvements are possible such as:\n+\n+- Separating indexes from `bitcoin-node`, and running indexing code in separate processes.\n+- Enabling wallet processes to listen for JSON-RPC requests on their own ports instead of needing the node process to listen and forward requests to them.\n+- Automatically generating `.capnp` files from C++ interface definitions (see [Interface Definition Maintenance](#interface-definition-maintenance))\n+- Simplifying and stabilizing interfaces (see [Interface Stability](#interface-stability))\n+- Adding sandbox features, restricting subprocess access to resources and data (see [https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin](https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin)).",
