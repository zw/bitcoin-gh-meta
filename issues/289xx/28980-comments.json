      "body" : "> UPD: After thinking more, I understood it depends on how the users performs the back up. If they back up the whole wallet file - it's safe. But just backing up the new HD seed is not safe. So, it seems recommending replacing backup is still slightly dangerous.\r\n\r\nWell, core currently lacks a mechanism for retrieving the HD seed. It refrains from outputting the seed post wallet creation and advises the user to back up the entire wallet file instead.\r\nThe same procedure can be seen after encryption at the GUI level too: [link]( https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/160d23677ad799cf9b493eaa923b2ac080c3fb8e/src/qt/askpassphrasedialog.cpp#L131).\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, replacing the old wallet file with the new one is safe, as it retains old keys after encryption. The only change is the storage of the new master seed and its derived descriptors.",
