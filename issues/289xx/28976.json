   "body" : "Blank wallets (wallets without any keys are scripts) are being detected as already being descriptor wallets even though they are not. This is because the check for whether a wallet is already a descriptor wallet uses the presence of a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` which is only setup when keys or scripts are found. This PR resolves this issue by checking for the descriptor wallet flag instead and subsequently skipping the keys and scripts part of migration for blank wallets.\r\n\r\nFixes the issue mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28868#issuecomment-1809641110",
