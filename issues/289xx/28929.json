   "body" : "Currently it is only possible to attach one serialization parameter to a stream at a time. For example, it is not possible to set a parameter controlling the transaction format and a parameter controlling the address format at the same time because one parameter will override the other.\r\n\r\nThis limitation is inconvenient for multiprocess code since it is not possible to create just one type of stream and serialize any object to it. Instead it is necessary to create different streams for different object types, which requires extra boilerplate and makes using the new parameter fields a lot more awkward than the older version and type fields.\r\n\r\nFix this problem by allowing an unlimited number of serialization stream parameters to be set, and allowing them to be requested by type. Later parameters will still override earlier parameters, but only if they have the same type.\r\n\r\nThis change requires replacing the `stream.GetParams()` method with a `stream.GetParams<T>()` method in order for serialization code to retrieve the desired parameters. The change is more verbose, but probably a good thing for readability because previously it could be difficult to know what type the `GetParams()` method would return, and now it is more obvious.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",
