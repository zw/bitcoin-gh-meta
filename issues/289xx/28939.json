   "body" : "We recently (in #28906) had OOM problems due to incorrect memory usage estimation. When `PoolResource` is used the estimation can be brittle because when implementing memusage estimation for a container it is not obvious when the pool can be used.\r\n\r\nAs suggested here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28906#issuecomment-1817885270, to prevent these problems in future we can simply let the `PoolResource` do all the accounting. Then the memory usage estimation is always accurate, even when the pool's memory chunks cannot be used.",
