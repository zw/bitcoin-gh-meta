   "body" : "A curious property of the current client is that command-line help (`--help`) will be translated when doing `bitcoin-qt --help` but not for `bitcoind --help`. The reason for this is that bitcoind doesn't contain the translations.\r\n\r\nThis makes it a waste of translator time. It could be achieved by linking `gettext` and converting the translations (see issue #6092). However I'm not sure it's worth it.\r\n\r\nMany options are extremely technical, and refer internals, making it difficult to translate usefully. This came up in discussion of e.g. #10949. If a message is not understood by translators (which are typically end-users, not developers) they'll either translate it literally, making it harder to understand instead of easier, with the added drawback of the user no longer being able to google it.",
