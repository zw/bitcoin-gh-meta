   "body" : "Removes vchDefaultKey which was only used for first run detection. Improves wallet first run detection by checking to see if any keys were read from the database.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a (rather contrived) case where an encrypted non-HD wallet has corruption such that the default key is no longer valid and is loaded into a Core version that supports HD wallets. This causes a runtime exception since a new hd master key is generated as the software believes the wallet file is newly created but cannot add the generated key to the wallet since it is encrypted. I was only able to replicate this error by creating a non-hd wallet, encrypting it, then editing the wallet using `db_dump` and `db_load` before loading the wallet with hd enabled. This problem has been reported by [two](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1993244.0) [users](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1746976.msg17511261#msg17511261) so it is something that can happen, although that raises the question of \"what corrupted the default key\".\r\n\r\n~P.S. I don't know what's up with the whitespace changes. I think my text editor is doing something stupid but I don't think those are important enough to attempt undoing them.~ Undid those",
