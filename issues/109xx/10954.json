   "body" : "My proposal is a new feature for Bitcoin to support automatic payments without breaking any security\r\n\r\n# Use Case\r\nA user wants to use a service that needs a credit card. The service charges him every time he uses the service. \r\n\r\nExample: Apple iTunes. \r\nEvery time the user buys an app, Apple will charge the user's card.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nCreate a pay out address associated with my own account.\r\n## Rules\r\nThe payout address is linked to my own wallet - so it can only get coins from my own address \r\nThe payout can only be charged by only one merchant - only one address can receive transfers from this payout address. \r\nThere is a daily and monthly withdraw limit\r\nThere is a way to query if the payout address has enough funds to make the purchase - This will trigger a query to the wallet\r\nThe wallet address cannot be known using only the payout address\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\nI think this proposal would largely increase bitcoin adoption as it solves one of the major problems with automatic payments that current bitcoin doesn't not support.\r\n",
