   "body" : "This PR is the last in a chain of PRs (#14437, #14711, and #15288) that make the wallet code access node state through an abstract [`Chain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces/chain.h) class in [`src/interfaces/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces) instead of using global variables like `cs_main`, `chainActive`, and `g_connman`. After this PR, wallet code no longer accesses global variables declared outside the wallet directory, and no longer calls functions accessing those globals (as verified by the `hide-globals` script in #10244).\r\n\r\nThis PR and the previous PRs have been refactoring changes that do not affect behavior. Previous PRs have consisted of lots of mechanical changes like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    wtx.nTimeReceived = GetAdjustedTime();\r\n+    wtx.nTimeReceived = m_chain->getAdjustedTime();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller, but less mechanical. It replaces last few bits of wallet code that access node state directly (through `CValidationInterface`, `CRPCTable`, and `CCoinsViewMemPool` interfaces) with code that uses the `Chain` interface.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow followup PR #10102 (multiprocess gui & wallet PR) to work without any significant updates to wallet code. Additionally they:\r\n\r\n* Provide a single place to describe the interface between wallet and node code.\r\n* Can make better wallet testing possible, because the `Chain` object consists of virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking. (This could be used to test edge cases in the rescan code, for example).",
