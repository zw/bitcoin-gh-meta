Prior to this commit this was the only place where the return value of `GetKeyID(â¦)` was unchecked.\r\n\r\nClarify our assumption of `addr.GetKeyID(keyid)` being `true` in this context via an assertion.\r\n\r\n(**Note to reviewers:** Let me know if this assumption is not being made. If the assumption is not made then the case of `!addr.GetKeyID(keyid)` should obviously be handled more gracefully than with an `assert` :-))",
