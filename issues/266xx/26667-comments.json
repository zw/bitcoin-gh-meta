One way around that is to stop the node, delete `mempool.dat` and start again with `-connect=0 -walletbroadcast=0`.\r\n\r\nThe first argument makes it so your node doesn't connect to other peers that would echo the transaction back. The second ensures your wallet doesn't put the transaction in the mempool.",
