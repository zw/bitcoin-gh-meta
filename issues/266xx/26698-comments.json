We build `libbitcoinconsensus.so` with guix using `-static-libstdc++` (side-note, we should perhaps move this into the build-system rather than guix).\r\n\r\nSo the idea here is that the entire c++ implementation should be compiled into the shared lib with no unresolved c++ stdlib symbols, and exporting only C symbols. That way the end-user can use any c++ impl (if any) they want without fear of collisions. And because there's no cross-boundary c++ calls, there's no benefit to having the shared typeinfo/exception symbols.\r\n\r\nArguably this is different than the libstdc++ bug that was closed as WONTFIX because (at least as far as I can tell) we're trying to do something completely safe.\r\n\r\nIf it turns out that tight firewall idea doesn't work because libstdc++ is stubborn about exporting symbols, we may need to either:\r\n- revisit the idea of `-static-libstdc++` and\r\n- Use the `--exclude-libs ALL` @hebasto has suggested",

However, it's not clear to me if, in the present day, that thread is still relevant/the expected behaviour, and, it's also completely possible that other bugs/changes in (expected) behaviour have emerged in `ld`, or `libstdc++`, over the past 15 years, leaving the discussion there outdated.\r\n\r\nI will also mention, that we currently skip exports checks for RISC-V binaries, because of std lib related symbol exports (#28095), so whatever the issue is here, it's also not specific to, or limited to libraries.",

Requiring that a fix does not introduce any regressions is obvious.\r\nBy the way, there were no comments regarding any introduced break in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24994.\r\n\r\nI mean, what is the point to analyze the current behavior with all possible tool combinations:\r\n\r\n>    * What currently happens with `lld` + `libstdc++`?\r\n> \r\n>    * What currently happens with `lld` + `libc++`?\r\n> \r\n>    * Maybe even, what happens with [`mold`](https://github.com/rui314/mold) and either standard library?\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\nIf any of those combinations works, I doubt we will modify the release build system to use this working toolchain.",
