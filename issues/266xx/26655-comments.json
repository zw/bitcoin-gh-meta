      "body" : "The provided wallet lacks a `bestblock` record which is used to inform Bitcoin Core of the chain that was last scanned with this wallet. Without this record, we assume the worst case which is that a rescan from genesis is required. As pruned nodes are unable to perform a rescan from genesis, such wallets will result in the error shown. However archival nodes may not observe a full rescan as after checking the `bestblock` record, we will check the key birthdays to determine the scope of the rescan.\r\n\r\nWallets lacking a `bestblock` record can be created using wallet tool `bitcoin-wallet`. This is because the wallet tool is a contextless tool - it does not have access to the blockchain. Thus it is unable to insert a correct `bestblock` record into newly created wallets. Given that your reproduction steps include the usage of the wallet tool, I suspect that the reason for this error is that the user is creating wallets with the wallet tool and then trying to load them into a pruned node.\r\n\r\nIf the user only needs to create new wallets, they can do so with the `createwallet` RPC. This should avoid this problem. If the issue is that they need to load a particular wallet that was creating using the wallet tool, then a workaround would be to load the wallet into an archival node to get the `bestblock` record written, then load the wallet into the pruned node. Alternatively, they could modify the database directly and insert a `bestblock` record borrowed from a different wallet that could be loaded.",
