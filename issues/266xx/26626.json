   "body" : "There are some cases where several individual keys are being used in the same descriptor functions. It can be inefficient to treat them all as separate descriptors. This PR adds a new syntax where multiple keys are provided in an array. This list of keys is a ranged KEY expression (like xpubs) with position in the range being explicitly provided. As the list of descriptors is a range, only non-ranged key expressions are allowed. This is to avoid issues with expanding nested ranges. xpubs can be used as key expressions so long as they do not specify a `*`.\r\n\r\nThe descriptors will be of the form `func({KEY, KEY, KEY,...})`.",
