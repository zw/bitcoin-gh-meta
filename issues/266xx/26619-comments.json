It makes sense to me do to this in advance, and I think we're close enough to the limit to go ahead? Could probably wait for another category to be added first too, but... since it's already implemented and we'll need it soon anyway, I think it's best to not waste more review/dev time by letting this go stale.\r\n\r\n> Maybe there should be a typedef?\r\n\r\nThat seems sensible. I don't think we'll need to replace the `uint64_t` anytime soon, but we're changing all the types now so might as well include that.",
