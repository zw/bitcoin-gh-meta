Rather than tagging a 24.1, which would give the false impression of a more stable point release, containing a number of bug fixes after months of 24.0 running in production, it's more appropritate to incorporate these additional fixes into 24.x, essentially consider 24.0 DOA, and tag a 24.0.1.\r\n\r\n> Or is the wallet bug less severe than thought?\r\n\r\nEverything I've seen, and been told, is that the wallet issue is significant enough to warrant a 24.0.1.",

      "body" : "> > Why 24.0.1 instead of 24.1?\r\n> \r\n> It is based on the assumption that 24.0 will be nuked from the bin folder, because of the wallet bug. Or is the wallet bug less severe than thought?\r\n\r\nit's pretty severe in that it affects users doing manual input selection, either in the GUI via coin control or via the RPC, which I think warrants nuking v24.0. \r\n\r\n> I don't see why that would involve going back to X.Y.Z versions. The way things stand, this should be v24.1, while v24.0 gets deleted (or not; irrelevant to the next version number).\r\n\r\nI'm not super familiar with semantic versioning, but v24.0.1 feels more appropriate as this isn't really a major update and more just replacing v24.0 with a bugfix",
