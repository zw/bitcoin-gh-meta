What we do need is an alternative to data and hashes in unspendable outputs so we can nudge the users using Bitcoin for timestamping and similar things towards methods that are less harmful.\r\n\r\nI'm still of the opinion that using OP_RETURN should always be as easy and cheap as creating an unspendable txout. That would mean allowing as many OP_RETURN outputs in a transaction as you want, and allowing up to 192 bytes of data per one. (OP_CHECKMULTISIG equivalent, either bare or with P2SH) There should never be an excuse to use an unspendable UTXO rather than OP_RETURN and pressuring people into not doing it via social means isn't working.\r\n\r\nStill, if a compromise is what it takes, it's a good step forward.\r\n\r\nOnce implemented widely, something @gmaxwell suggested was to change the UI so that creating a zero-value out transaction actually creates an OP_RETURN with the digest as the data. I think we should also see if we can convince blockchain.info to implement this on their API in some way. All the timestamping sites and phone apps that have popped up recently seem to use blockchain.info so it'd be great to use that as a way of pushing people onto OP_RETURN. In particular it'd be great if blockchain.info could make 20-byte out OP_RETURN txouts be indexed in their database as though they were addresses to give users a way to look up their timestamps, thus making the overall experience of doing the better thing strictly easier than harming the network.\r\n\r\nI'll review/test code later.",

Given that each 20-byte-hash output has a cost in terms of Bitcoins burned (due to the dust rule) it'd be enough to make the data allowed in an OP_RETURN be equal to 20 bytes, and either require the rest to destroy Bitcoins, or just make all OP_RETURN's not subject to the dust rule to make it clear that implementing OP_RETURN in your shitty app is worth the trouble. (note how in this case relative to the data storage required by legit financial transactions you're paying a large premium per-byte because you can't make use of the 8-byte txout value while they can, and eventually we can even mandate it's actually a hash a-la P2SH^2)\r\n\r\nAnyway my point is that you don't shape behavior by just telling people, you have to actually force them through incentives and limitations.",
