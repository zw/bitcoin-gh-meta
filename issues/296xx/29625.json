   "body" : "This PR contains a number of vaguely-related improvements to the random module.\r\n\r\nThe specific changes and more detailed rationale is in the commit messages, but the highlights are:\r\n\r\n* `XoRoShiRo128PlusPlus` (previously a test-only RNG) moves to random.h and becomes `InsecureRandomContext`, which is even faster than `FastRandomContext` but non-cryptographic. It also gets all helper randomness functions (`randrange`, `fillrand`, ...), making it a lot more succinct to use.\r\n* During tests, **all** randomness is made deterministic (except for `GetStrongRandBytes`) but non-repeating (like `GetRand()` used to be when `g_mock_deterministic_tests` was used), either fixed, or from a random seed (overridden by env var).\r\n* Several infrequently used top-level functions (`GetRandMillis`, `GetRandMicros`, `GetExponentialRand`) are converted into member functions of `FastRandomContext` (and `InsecureRandomContext`).\r\n* `GetRand<T>()` (without argument) can now return the maximum value of the type (previously e.g. `GetRand<uint32_t>()` would never return 0xffffffff).",
