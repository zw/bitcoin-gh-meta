In the addresses database of my node there are 2778 addresses that have advertised v2 out of 72821 total.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to respond and consider my feature request.\r\n\r\nI understand your concern about potential network partitioning, but I believe that similar risks exist with other features in Bitcoin as well. While I acknowledge that relying solely on V2 protocol connections may limit the available nodes, I believe it's crucial for those who rely on V2 for verifying the authenticity of connections.\r\n\r\n> For ensuring you really connect to the intended node (avoid MITM) using Tor or I2P may be easier or better alternative. In those networks the address represents the peer's public key and naturally when you establish a connection you know you are talking to the one who possesses the private key which corresponds to the address / public key.\r\n\r\nRegarding your suggestion about using Tor or I2P connections, I appreciate the alternative, but it's important to note that some corporate networks restrict or outright disallow connections over these networks. Additionally, in certain regions, Tor and I2P connections may be filtered out, making it essential to have the option to connect over regular IPV4 and IPV6. In such cases, being able to identify V2 connections can be instrumental.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while it's true that V2 protocol usage alone does not guarantee protection against MITM attacks, it does provide an additional layer of security, especially for those who require confirmation of a \"bonafide\" node.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I still believe that having the ability to specify V2 protocol connections would be beneficial, particularly in scenarios where other options are restricted or unavailable.\r\n\r\n",

When picking up automatic outbound peers, we take care to have at least one peer from each of the reachable networks. Should we then insist on having at least one clearnet-v2 connection? In other words, treat ipv4-v1 and ipv4-v2 as separate networks for the purpose of choosing outbound peers?",

However, it's worth noting that until I explicitly set the flag, my nodes weren't utilizing V2 connections by default. I understand that this behavior may change to be on by default in version 27 if I am reading everything correctly.\r\n\r\n> 2. Opening v2-only connections for all outbound connections to clearnet peers (for Tor, I2P and CJDNS v1 is as fine because they do encryption anyway).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be preferable if the connection couldn't be established when using addnode in certain situations. For instance, if you're in an environment where the default fallback could potentially expose you to security risks, having this control would be invaluable.
