   "body" : "The function `GetFirstStoredBlock()` helps us find the first block for which we have data. So far this function only looked for a block with `BLOCK_HAVE_DATA`. However, this doesn't mean that we also have the undo data of that block, and undo data might be required for what a user would like to do with those blocks. One example of how this might happen is if some blocks were fetched using the `getblockfrompeer` RPC. Blocks fetched from a peer will have data but no undo data.\r\n\r\nThe first commit here allows `GetFirstStoredBlock()` to check for undo data as well by passing a parameter. This alone is useful for #29553 and I would use it there.\r\n\r\nIn the second commit I am applying the undo check to the RPCs that report `pruneheight` to the user. I find this much more intuitive because I think the user expects to be able to do all operations on blocks up until the `pruneheight` but that is not the case if undo data is missing. I personally ran into this once before and now again when testing for assumeutxo when I had used `getblockfrompeer`. The following commit adds test coverage for this.\r\n\r\nThe last commit adds a note in the docs of `getblockfrompeer` that undo data will not be available.\r\n",
