Not a strong opinion, but I think just mechanically replacing s/LogPrint/LogDebug/ and s/LogPrintf/LogInfo/ everywhere would not provide a major benefit, and while it may be true that \"this will have to be done at some point\" I think the point where it'd be nicest to do this would be after #29256 when we are able to define log sources to make `LogDebug` calls less verbose, and add missing category information to `LogInfo` calls.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't object to this PR if other reviewers think it's a worthwhile improvement and are ok with the long list of conflicts. I just think there are other improvements we should make to log prints besides this one, and it would be better to change each individual log print once instead of changing it multiple times.",
