It seems to me that we would probably want at least one if not two magnitudes lower, _especially_ if we are looking at a complete package and therefore already consider children bumping parents in the appropriate context?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @murchandamus in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28950_\r\n\r\nReviewing #28950 I was reminded that our default `maxfeerate` is 100,000â¯sat/vB. We have only seen blocks with minimum feerates of over 1000â¯sat/vB once in a brief time-frame around Christmas 2017. \r\n\r\n100,000â¯sat/vB seems too high to appropriately fulfill its function as a safeguard against accidental fee overpayment. I would suggest to reduce it to 5000â¯sat/vB in the GUI, and perhaps even to 1000 when building a transaction from the command line where it is easy to override the maxfeerate when such a high feerate is actually warranted (e.g. when creating a small child transaction bumping a large parent).\r\n\r\n",
