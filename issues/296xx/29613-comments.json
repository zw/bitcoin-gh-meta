I've just upgraded and tested Bitcoin Core against Sparrow 1.8.4 and RPC connection is working OK. \r\n\r\nI see you have an Issue open in Sparrow already: https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/issues/1311 and I agree this is probably the best place for it.\r\n\r\nEnsure you've checked your path(s) are correct in Sparrow, and whether you should be using cookie (\"default\") or username and password to connect. You can test most of these settings with `bitcoin-cli` (`-rpcuser=xxx -rpcpassword=xxx` and optionally `-rpcport=nnn`, or `-rpccookiefile=/path/`) to narrow down what might be setup incorrectly for you.",
