   "body" : "This picks up the work from #29331 and closes #29258.\r\n\r\nHere I simply change the type and address (hopefully) all the comments from #29331 by changing the type in all relevant places and removing unnecessary casts. I have also added an extremely simple unit test.\r\n\r\nIn some [draft by sjors from 5 years ago](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4485700f93fb609ee292964fa70e89af88ecdd55) I saw that he took the chance to rename the variable to `m_chain_num_tx`. I didnât do this now because `nChainTx` isnât terrible IMO, just outdated, but happy to do this if people think itâs valuable.\r\n\r\nThere was also talk about a memory-optimized solution for this by combining nChainTx and nTx: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29258#issuecomment-1929388354 I tried out an approach to this here: https://github.com/fjahr/bitcoin/commit/b9382041e541569a2b8ec7ed1f7fb10aa602277f (patch is on top of the changes here), still rough and requires cleanup of docs but it works (tests pass) and I am happy to take this route if itâs preferred.",
