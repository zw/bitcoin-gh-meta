      "body" : "> My understanding is that Ledger (cc @bigspider) creates a nonce, stores it, and then deletes it from storage as soon as it's loaded (before signing). We could similarly store the nonce in our wallet and then delete the field at the start of the new round. For safety we could disable backups and dump RPC's while a round is in progress (e.g. with a `NO_BACKUP` flag).\r\n\r\nNot yet implemented, but that's the plan: store nonces in flash memory (persistent memory) after generation; remove them from flash memory _before_ signing starts (therefore, they're gone even if there is a later failure, and signing must restart from nonce generation).\r\n\r\nNote that there is no backup possibility for the persistent memory.",
