   "body" : "This PR implements the [proposed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1540) MuSig2 descriptors, derivation, and PSBT fields so that the wallet can receive and spend from taproot addresses that have keys involving a MuSig2 aggregate key.\r\n\r\nThis pulls in (an older version of) the musig module in libsecp (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1479) in order to do all of the necessary MuSig2 computation.\r\n\r\nAn open question is whether the approach for handling the secnonces is ideal and safe. Since nonces must not be reused, this PR holds them exclusively in memory, so a restart of the software will require a restart of the MuSig2 signing process. Additionally, the current MuSig API in libsecp basically involves us holding onto and passing around an opaque libsecp object. There may be some additional work there to make the code more ergonomic.",
