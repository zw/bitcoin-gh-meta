      "body" : "Thanks @Sjors , I added some thoughts inline, then deleted most of it again because it was way too convoluted :) I think the tldr for me is: You ask if including the params in the code open up any new attack vectors. And in my mind the answer is no, because if an attacker can influence the code that users are actually running, then they have unlimited options to profit from that. For the alternative, configurable params, I am not so sure that it doesn't introduce new attack vectors and I think this hasn't been thought through enough because there was consensus to add the code with chainparams.\r\n\r\n> I think \"Make params configurable/not hardcoded params\" should be under \"critical conceptual discussion\". Not the part about flexibility, which I agree is low priority.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that we can have that discussion afterwards when the feature sees some adoption and there is interest in not relying on the params. In my mind it would only be critical if hardcoding for now would prevent us from moving away from it in the future. But this isn't consensus, so there is no issue with doing this :) I am happy to have such discussion now but I don't think we need a resolution before anyone can use au on mainnet. If there is consensus for moving away from hardcoded params before we are done with the \"critical\" section here, then there will be PR that is added to the critical list that implements that functionality and the mainnet params PR will be removed from the list. If we merge the params first and then agree on not hardcoding them anymore, the params will simply be removed with that PR later.\r\n\r\nCan you say what you mean with \"the part about flexibility\" that is different from configurable params? I am not sure we are thinking of the same thing there.\r\n\r\n> What's more fundamental is the question of whether these parameters should be \"blessed\" by the Bitcoin Core project.\r\n> \r\n> One could argue that there is no \"blessing\", because these snapshots can be objectively assessed. A snapshot hash is valid if and only if background validation yields the same result. Any other snapshot, if it somehow makes into the code, is either a bug or an exploit.\r\n\r\nI would call it a \"temporary blessing\" if anything because it's really all about the time window before the background sync finishes. If users could wait for the background validation to complete, they would just be doing IBD.\r\nIt should be kept in mind that this was always the fundamental assumption (pun intended) of the project: the parameters in the code are a blessing just like the code itself is a blessing. If you trust the developers with a bitcoin core release and the code in it you can also trust them with the included chain params.\r\n\r\n> This makes this feature different from checkpoints in a fundamental way. A checkpoint can be abused to override the most-work valid chain.

Creating coins out of thin air should still be easily detectable if some check the snapshot against their own node at a specific height, even if nobody has the full chain anymore. So I don't think assumeutxo itself adds a new attack vector here.\r\n\r\n> In this particular scenario I don't think it matters at all if the hash is part of chainparams or if it's flexible.

After removing the requirement for the chainparams old snapshots that were previously committed in the codebase will still work and the RPCs don't have to change either.\r\n\r\nBut maybe you rather mean that contributors of bitcoin core will want to add the chainparams \"because that's what we have always done\"? I think we are already a bit stuck in in that regard because \"the proposal has been like this for 5 years\" ;) And I believe that it can actually become an easier conversation after the feature is in use in its initial form because when this is regularly used I am pretty sure that we will get requests about not having to wait for a new release every time to be able to use a new snapshot. Such requests could be much more motivating than any theoretical discussion.\r\n\r\n> I don't think there was much discussion on the trade-offs between these two approaches.\r\n\r\nYeah, from what I remember discussions were more focussed on whether this is a good idea/secure even with the chainparams, which is why it would actually surprise me if we would get a swing of opinion on this now.
