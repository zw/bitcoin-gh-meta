(That is 3.80 USD for 300 bytes).\r\n**As fee is more than 10% of the sent amount, Bitcoin Core should choose a lower fee for this single transaction.**\r\nBitcoin Core chooses the 11 block fee, that is 0.6mBTC/kB to be confirmed in the next 11 blocks (That is 0.93 USD for 300 bytes).\r\nBitcoin Core displays a warning to Bob explaining the situation.\r\n\r\n**Bob pays lower transaction fee** (9% fee Vs 38% fee). Bob is happy.\r\n\r\nThis should be the default behaviour, the user can later change the fee if he wants to.\r\n\r\n### TL;DR: Make Bitcoin Core aware of the amount sent and lower the fees if it is more than 10% of sent amount. \r\n",
