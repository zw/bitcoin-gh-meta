I think in general checking for the specific error we expect makes it less likely that we inadvertently introduce a bug in the tests; certainly this kind of thing has cropped up in the functional test suite, where bugs introduced into a test harness cause the test to not actually be testing anything, or to be testing the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nIMO the downside (in general) to additional specificity is that it adds overhead when making changes to the consensus code rejection reasons, because now all the tests that were hardcoded for a particular reason need updating.  This patch seems pretty small though, and I don't think that should be much of a concern here.  In fact I think we largely already do similar reject-reason-pattern-matching in the functional tests as well.",

I did actually run into it while trying an extremely high value for MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS_COST (250x) in an [experiment](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/1). In attempt to make the test pass, I increased the transaction generation loops from 1001 to 250001, which obviously(?) took forever to run. I then tried fewer loops to get a sense of performance. To my surprise the test passed for some seemingly random intermediate value. Once I found the actual error message I realized it was an error in the modified test; it just ran out of coins somewhere in the loop. Lowering the coinbase reward in the test was an easier way to reproduce that specific error.",

That should make later refactoring easier and also prevent typos.\r\n\r\nSo now each test looks like this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nBOOST_CHECK_EXCEPTION(\r\n    functionThatThrows(),\r\n    std::runtime_error,\r\n    CheckRejectInvalid(REJECT_INVALID_BAD_CB_MULTIPLE)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as a result of this change, when a test throws a different exception, it no longer shows what that exception was.
