      "body" : "But probably the most convincing reason this is a good idea is the giant attack vector it closes. Currently if you know someone's bitcoin address you can send them spam at incredibly cheap prices. An output is ~34 bytes so using a low fee rate (since you don't care it confirms) that's about 34 satoshis in fees and say you burn another 650 satoshis if you want to make your transaction standard (which you don't even necessarily have to do). Let's round up and call it 700 satoshis per output.\r\n\r\nRight now there's not much fee pressure, so you can send relatively cheaply at 136 satoshi per byte. Sourcing one of these unspent is around 148 bytes so that's going to run you 20128 satoshis to spend! \r\n\r\nSo deducting the 650 satoshis they sent you, this attack costs the bitcoin-core-user about 28x what it costs the attacker! And the situation can (and often is) worse with fee rates double that.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not even theoretical. I'm aware of at least one case of one service that was using core and spammed in this manner, and ended up burning through >1 bitcoin in transaction fees before they realized what was wrong.",
