   "body" : "When partially signing a transaction using `signrawtransaction`, if the wallet doesn't have access to a key, it will output a scary error message `\"error\": \"Operation not valid with the current stack size\"`, yet it will partially sign the transaction anyway. This puts a lot of users off, because they don't realise the signing actually succeeded for some inputs. This catches that specific error when signing, and outputs a friendlier message which says `Unable to sign input, invalid stack size (possibly missing key)`. \r\n\r\nThis is the best way I could think of to fix the issue, but please let me know if you come up with a better way to do it :)\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9988",
