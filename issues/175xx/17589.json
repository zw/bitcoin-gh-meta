Configure Bisq to use a certain node running v 0.19 (I used my own node)\r\n2. Starting Bisq results in not getting connected.\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\nVersions used:\r\nBisq 1.2.3\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core 0.19.0.1\r\nfrom bitcoin core website\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nLink to change log describing new default settings for BIP111 and BIP37 (see \"P2P changes\"):\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.19.0.1.md\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Use a node which has \"peerbloomfilters=1\" set. Whitelisting did not work for me.",
