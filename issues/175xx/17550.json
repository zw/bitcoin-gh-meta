As long as we're supporting macOS < 10.12 we would not be able to bump Qt in depends to 5.12 for the `v0.20.0` release.\r\n\r\nOnce we drop support for 10.12 and start using the 10.15 SDK there are some other follow ups:\r\n* Enabling support for [`thread_local`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/configure.ac#L901).\r\n* Removing some of the macOS notification code\r\n* Removing macOS [startup item code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/qt/guiutil.cpp#L695).\r\n\r\nThere was also some related discussion in the `#bitcoin-builds` channel yesterday arvo.\r\n\r\n",
