This PR fixes that by instead linking to the official docs about running a node. \r\n \r\nAlso, changed the download link to point to the download page instead of the releases page.\r\n\r\nThis is a near-duplicate of [PR14755](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14755) that was closed (maybe prematurely).  Please see that PR for some discussion.",
