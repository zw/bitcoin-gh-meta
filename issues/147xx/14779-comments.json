This means it is not in plaintext in the bitcoin.conf file like it was for `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword`. There is no way for `bitcoin-cli` to know what the password is when `rpcauth` is used, so cookie authentication is needed in order for `bitcoin-cli` to be able to get a password that works.",

      "body" : "Yeah that's definitely something to think about. It's the age-old trade-off between security and convenience. It seems to me that if I'm concerned enough about security to use rpcauth instead of rpcuser+rpcpassword, I won't be happy that my efforts to avoid writing the password to disk in plain text have been nullified by the fact that bitcoind writes the cookie file. For my two cents, the fact that bitcoin-cli won't \"just work\" if I've specified rpcauth is a feature (the closing of a security gap) not a bug. Perhaps if rpcauth is present, cookie-based auth is off unless rpccookiefile (or a separate dedicated flag) is also present.",
