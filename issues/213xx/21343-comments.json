I don't think it would be 'better' to point to dependencies.md and have the user figure out how that dependency correlates to their system.\n\n> I think the same can be said for all of the \"configuration\" blocks. These seem to get repeated (across lots of docs) in varying combinations and levels of verbosity, and I'd think a lot of the time they might just be downright confusing to a first time builder.\n\nJust trying to improve that situation across the build docs so that it's informative in the right ways to get someone up and running with a couple of examples that are relevant.\n\n> This also includes the parts where configure output is basically pasted verbatim into documentation. i.e upnp or libnatpmp options. Can't we just tell users to look at `configure --help`? This means they'll always be getting accurate information; rather than something pasted into a build doc that now may have drifted from what actually happens.\n\nWell I was thinking that the build docs can be a one-stop place on how to get up and running. I think it would be way more confusing for a first time builder to have to hop through 3 different files and try to piece together the right information. \n\nThe information doesn't need to drift away from what's happening if it's maintained.\n\n\n\n",
