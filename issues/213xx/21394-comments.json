However, I don't think the code comment on `ChainSyncTimeoutState` should be there at all:\r\n\r\n- it's rephrasing in English what the code is already saying in C++ (incorrectly, prior to this PR). Comments should explain *why* the code is doing something, not *what* it's doing, since the code already documents *what* the code does, and 100% accurately.\r\n- it's documenting logic that is hundreds of lines away from the comment. Distant comments inevitably become outdated as the logic changes.",
