Maybe give it an absurd timeout, or verify that the numTasksInQueue are decreasing?\r\n\r\nIf the queue never drains (for example if every task keeps adding new taks), it will keep going on for ever.\r\nIf the join takes longer than say, 60 seconds this could be flagged as an error as well. Ironically this was easier to accomplish with the loop of #6145.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there are plenty of Python unit tests that have 'wait forever' failure scenarios as well, so I don't think this is a big problem. \r\nThis fixes the immediate issue so utACK.\r\n",
