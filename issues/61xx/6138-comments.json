Changing the payment screen makes only sense if it's a real improvement. Otherwise it might confuse users.\r\n\r\nBut i agree that there are some uncommon ways of handling the sendcoinsdialog. The \"Choose...\" (expand) button is uncommon and the position of the maximize/minimize button (\"Choose...\" and \"Hide\") should keep the position. It should more follow the ways of how users handle maximize/minimize screen types (like on the web with +/- patterns). The \"fee details\" (\"Choose...\" button) could also open a new dialog or at least the maximize/minimize toggle should be animated.",
