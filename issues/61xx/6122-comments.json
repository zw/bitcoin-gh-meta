Note how if you start a node with -listen=0 you'll never have anyone connect to you, yet we still relay blocks. The same logic should apply here.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't get is why make this dependent on the peer's advertised starting height? Why should their height (which may be out of date) have any relevance to whether or not we relay a block? Instead I think this should be based only on our height, with an appropriate window to prevent stalls.\r\n\r\nAs for the size of that window... isn't this code only triggered when *we* get a new block? You'd have to get a burst of >288 blocks in a row in non-initial-download mode to run into that problem - seems rather unlikely. I'm not sure it's really worth having extra code for such an unlikely case.",

If we know, that the other has at least what we have (minus 288), nothing can go wrong. \r\nThe code already is executed for (!fInitialDownload), which is based on our height.

      "body" : "I made a couple code comments, but in reviewing this I noticed another issue.\r\n\r\nI think pruning nodes should respond to a \"getblocks\" message differently than non-pruning nodes, so that they don't ever generate an inv for a block they don't have on disk.  I haven't generated this scenario in a test yet, but I believe it's possible to be in a situation where an 0.9 (or earlier) node could send a getblocks message to a pruning node, and if the 0.9 node is far enough behind, that could result in a pruning node serving up inv's for blocks it doesn't have (which the 0.9 node would then request, but not be able to receive, and then eventually disconnect).\r\n\r\nAssuming we agree that behavior should change, then I think perhaps this pull could be much simpler, where we don't need to bother with the special case here in the event that we're pruning (ie we just remove the ```if (nLocalServices & NODE_NETWORK)```) on line 2286.  My reasoning:\r\n\r\n- 0.10 and later nodes will not download non-inv'ed blocks except from NODE_NETWORK peers (there's a guard around the call to ```FindNextBlocksToDownload```)\r\n- 0.9 and 0.8 nodes rely on inv's, including those generated in response to a getblocks, to determine what to ask for from a peer\r\n\r\n(I'm not all that familiar with the p2p behavior of 0.9 and 0.8 nodes though, hopefully someone more familiar can confirm that the above is correct.)\r\n\r\nI guess one thing I am not sure how to consider is the p2p behavior of even older bitcoin core clients (which I haven't looked at) and non-bitcoin-core clients.  But my first thought is that if we're advertising ourselves as not being NODE_NETWORK and we're only generating inv's for blocks that we have (and are likely to still have for some reasonable time window), that this ought to be acceptable network behavior.",

Perhaps we should consider #5307 with some small cap on the number of blocks to inv, so that small reorgs would be successfully relayed from a pruning node to an 0.10 node (though with the n^2 overhead mentioned in that pull)?",
