I ask since it seems you had your hands in the travis yml last, I can look at the bitcoinj side to see what it would take, seems it might just need an update to handle 0.10?\r\n\r\nfailing build: https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/61800593\r\n\r\npassing build (throws exceptions all over - Ctrl-F \"Exception\" ):https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/61800595 \r\n\r\n*tool hasn't seen a commit since december, and likely needs 0.10 updates: https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/bitcoinj/core/BitcoindComparisonTool.java\r\n\r\nedit: link to erroneous build command https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/Makefile.am#L195-L197",
