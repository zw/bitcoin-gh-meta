      "body" : "@laanwj I don't see a case where deleting or hiding a still-valid transaction is a good idea. And the only way it can become invalid is if a conflicting one is confirmed; even in that case, I don't think we want erase semantics. IMO the signal should go. The wallet may conceivably want to erase a transaction it is respending itself, especially once the respend has confirmed, so I agree the CWallet method should stay for now.",
