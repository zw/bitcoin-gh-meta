At least in the non-exception case, the logs are\ninitialized as soon as the parameter interaction checking begins in\nAppInit2 and nothing really needs to hit the logs before that.  It looks\nlike this may be as simple as just moving the cut and the version string to\nthe start of the parameter interaction checks...\n\nThis might change the ordering of the messages, but it does have the\ndesirable property of keeping locality between messages and related code.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nOn Wed, May 13, 2015 at 12:06 PM, Jeff Garzik <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> hmmmm.
