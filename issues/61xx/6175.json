   "body" : "This is proposal in reaction to current Bitfinex hack. It has similar pattern as previous BitStamp hack. The most damages are made by other parties sending their bitcoins to the compromised addresses after hack has been discovered and confirmed. This proposal introduces new message being broadcast through the network with list of addresses to put on a blacklist\r\n\r\nBlacklist means:\r\n- any client refuses to public transaction containing blacklisted address\r\n- miners reject a transaction containing blacklisted address\r\n\r\nTo put address on the blacklist requires to have the private key. Every address on the list must contain correct signature and expiration of the blocking.\r\n\r\n(sorry for english)",
