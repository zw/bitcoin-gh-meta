While it is not possible to\r\nhit this consensus bug on mainnet or testnet3 due to the higher\r\ncurrent difficulties, it is easily hit on regtest after generating\r\n2016 blocks, forcing the retarget.\r\n\r\n~~Note: to convert between the arith_uint256 and arith_uint512 classes, I created a new static function in the base_uint base class that copies the data from one to the other.  However, to do this, I had to make the protected members `WIDTH` and `pn` public, so they could be accessed.  Not too happy with this, and I think that I need to use `friend` to allow access, but I'm not sure exactly how to do that.  Suggestions welcome.~~",
