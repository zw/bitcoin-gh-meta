   "body" : "This takes the rather obvious step of keeping a circular buffer of CTransactionRefs which is populated with orphan transactions, transactions replaced out of mempool, and rejected transactions and uses them to populate compact blocks.\r\n\r\nIt defaults to 100 transactions in size, the same as the orphan map, which, in the worst case, would be about 40MB+memory overhead (this would be 100 400K-weight witness-only-ish transactions replaced, same as the orphan map).\r\n\r\nIt limits rejected transactions to 100KB in memory usage before storing.\r\n\r\nIn previous tests, @gmaxwell had indicated that if we had an infinite-sized buffer here we could save a ton of compact-block-round-trips, so in non-adversarial conditions even a small buffer should help at least sometimes.
