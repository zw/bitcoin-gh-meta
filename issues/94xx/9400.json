Currently a peer can just share a header, withhold the full block, and be selected as a HB peer, denying other less-malicious peers their slot. The attacker could possibly get 3 connections with the node, then block all useful CB propagation gains.\r\n\r\nAfter this fix the worst that can happen is malicious peers are first to give you valid full blocks to stay in the HB slots.\r\n",
