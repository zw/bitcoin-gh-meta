   "body" : "This is a re-submission of PR #9453 with the TravisCI integration and language removed based on feedback.\r\n\r\nThe changes are a significant iteration to `contrib/devtools/copyright_header.py`. Like the preceding version, this script is able to parse through the source files and report on the state of the copyright headers as well as update the year.\r\n\r\nThe first major improvement is that it now has a ruleset specific for each subtree to detect the local proper header style (the subtrees being secp256k1, leveldb, univalue and ctaes).\r\n\r\nThe second major improvement is that it now makes more elegant use of Python's regular expressions to detect and manipulate the header text. This approach should be maintainable and extensible while keeping the script's execution time quick.\r\n\r\nThe third major improvement is the addition of a `check` command which gives a positive or negative acceptance for the state of the repository according to the rules of the script. When issues are found, it also gives more direct suggestions for how to resolve. The purpose is to better assist periodic maintenance of the state of the copyright headers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, some minor tweaks are done to make the set of copyright headers more consistent. The addition of the MIT license header to `contrib/dev/tools/gen-manpages.sh` was previously ACKed by @nomnombtc in #9453.",
