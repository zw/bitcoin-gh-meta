   "body" : "This disentangles the script validation skipping from checkpoints.\r\n\r\nA new option is introduced \"assumevalid\" which specifies a block whos\r\n ancestors we assume all have valid scriptsigs and so we do not check\r\n them when they are also burried under the best header by a weeks\r\n worth of work.\r\n\r\nUnlike checkpoints this has no influence on consensus unless you set\r\n it to a block with an invalid history.  Because of this it can be\r\n easily be updated without risk of influencing the network consensus.\r\n\r\nThis results in a massive IBD speedup.\r\n\r\nThis approach was independently recommended by Peter Todd and Luke-Jr\r\n since POW based signature skipping (see PR#9180) does not have the\r\n verifiable properties of a specific hash and may create bad incentives.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that, like checkpoints, the defaults bitrot and older\r\n releases will sync slower.  On the plus side users can provide their\r\n own value here, and if they set it to something crazy all that will\r\n happen is more time will be spend validating signatures.\r\n\r\nCheckblocks and checklevel are also moved to the hidden debug options:\r\n Especially now that checkblocks has a low default there is little need\r\n to change these settings, and users frequently misunderstand them as\r\n influencing security or IBD speed.  By hiding them we offset the\r\n space added by this new option.",
