   "body" : "The code was previously using boost::signals2 for communication between\r\n net and net_processing.  Because there are no other participants and\r\n the relationship was completely static, this was providing no value.\r\n\r\nBoost signals are rather complex and expensive compared to a direct\r\n function call:  They involve locking and roughly a screen full of\r\n backtrace, an they make the control flow less clear. In places\r\n where there are multiple participants or wiring that changes,\r\n they can be worth their cost-- but none of that is being used in this\r\n case and I can't foresee it being used here.\r\n\r\nI also found that removing this indirection resulted in a ~4% IBD\r\n speedup on top of #9415.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone has a reason we should be using this? I asked sipa before opening this PR but didn't seem to know.",
