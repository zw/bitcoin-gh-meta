We can also always tell if rate limiting is taking place since we log when it starts/stops and in those cases a partial log is better then no log.\r\n\r\n(This is obviously mostly an opinion and I am totally willing to be convinced of global log-schedding if enough reviewers favor it)",

I'm not certain I got it right though - @jnewbery, feel free to chime in :)\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to do it as separate PR since it deviates in important ways from the original suggestion. By having two separate PRs we would see which of the two approaches to address this type of attack that have consensus support.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think I could live with both approaches: as long as we kill the disk-fill-via-logging bug class sooner rather than later I'm happy :)",

      "body" : "@practicalswift Rebased :)\r\n\r\nFor anyone reviewing this: I made a rpc [here](https://github.com/dergoegge/bitcoin/commit/8e6d15d6be06834d1f634f4a54ea646be8bc3491) that can log excessive amounts of \"a\"s from different locations which might be useful for testing.\r\n`bitcoin-cli excessivelog <location (1-5)> <num_bytes>`\r\n\r\nâ ï¸One thing to note with that rpc is that the rate limiting logic still prints the last message that triggered the limiting to disk, so something like `bitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 536870912` would still log ~512MiB to disk. Logging to console is also never suppressed (unless -printtoconsole=0)  â ï¸\r\n\r\nA simple example to use the rpc:\r\n```bash\r\nbitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 1048500 # log just under 1MiB\r\nbitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 100 # this should get the total amount logged above 1MiB and the rate limiting logic should kick in\r\n```",
