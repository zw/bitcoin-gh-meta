   "body" : "This is an alternative to #25354 (by my benchmarking, somewhat faster), subsumes #25712, and adds additional test vectors.\r\n\r\nIt separates the multiple-of-64-bytes-only \"core\" logic (which becomes simpler) from a layer around which performs caching/slicing to support arbitrary byte amounts. Both have their uses (in particular, the MuHash3072 code can benefit from multiple-of-64-bytes assumptions), plus the separation results in more readable code. Also, since FastRandomContext effectively had its own (more naive) caching on top of ChaCha20, that can be dropped in favor of ChaCha20's new built-in caching.\r\n\r\nI thought about rebasing #25712 on top of this, but the changes before are fairly extensive, so redid it instead.",
