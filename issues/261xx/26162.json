This also makes sense given that `bip34` was listed even though it's  older than `bip16`.\r\n\r\n_TODO_: the current version partly reverts #11739, which seems like going in the wrong direction. So rather than stuffing BIP16 and Taproot activation height into the consensus critical `ChainParams`, I plan to move them to `deploymentinfo.h`. This paves the way to dropping the other buried BIPs from `ChainParams` too later.",
