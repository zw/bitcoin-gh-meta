After fixing them, no more errors were reported.\n\nFurthermore, I let bitcoind run with that tool, along with another one which detects memory corruption problems (even more kinds of memory corruption than valgrind is able to detect), while confirming the latest ~150 blocks of the main net. It successfully confirmed them without any apparent problems.\n",
