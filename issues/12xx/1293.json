Class CDBInit() existed to provide a\nguaranteed-via-C++-destructor cleanup of the db environment.\n\nA formal CDBEnv class provides all of this inside a single wrapper.\n\nNOTES:\n1) Other db.cpp-related operations might be candidates for CDBEnv inclusion.  This current commit was chosen as a good starting point, only encapsulating clearly-dbenv-related items.\n2) Further wrappers may easily encapsulate remaining direct bitdb.dbenv accesses, though it hardly seems worth it.\n3) CDBEnv is a starting point for easy cross-database transactions.  BDB supports this, but bitcoin codebase hardcodes txn<->database association into CDB.\n",
