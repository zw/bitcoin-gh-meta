Window clearly specifies it is about window behavior, whereas \"Display\" is about displaying things *within* the client window. \r\n\r\nThe \"Main\" page is for the leftovers, that would be on a page of their own if properly categorized (fee should be under \"Sending\" or \"Transaction\", detach database settings should be under \"Database\" etc...). Start at startup would be about \"System\".  So maybe moving it back to main makes sense. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, window system integration is a kindof window behavior, and the point was moving things OUT of \"Main\". I'm a bit divided about this, and don't really want to spend too much time thinking about it, as it is only a very minor issue.\r\n",
