Testing double-spend detection is good, but currently the test's success depends on syncing accounting data to true double-spends (not good).\r\n\r\nWe could reinstate the specific malleability test txnmall.sh for as long as accounting behavior matters and mutants are possible.\r\n\r\n@gavinandresen wrote this new test, so I'm hoping he can weigh in on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
