This results in the crawler having to reconnect after a full snapshot of the network is taken. This makes the crawler appear abusive in nature to some users.\r\n\r\n@sipa I have monitored the transferred bytes closely between the crawler and each node but didn't realize the undesirable RAM/CPU usage coming from it just to maintain the connection.\r\n\r\nI am going to revisit my approach again in the next couple of days and at the very least revert the crawler back to its previous behaviour, i.e. connect and disconnect from each node to take snapshot of the network.\r\n",

In each case there was some discussion and at least I left with the impression that the behaviour would be fixed. Then later we find it doing something substantially similar, not changed, or even worse.\r\n\r\nClearly there are some consistent problems with communication and/or understanding.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the dnsseed itself, much of its behaviour is even more difficult to monitor or audit than the crawler. Plus, we have no great and urgent need for more dnsseeds, in fact our reliance on them is lower than it was in the past.  With that in mind, I'd rather not waste my cycles trying to figure out ways to determine if this seed is behaving correctly, and I suspect that Ayeowch would probably rather not spend time defending the seed service which is nothing but costs to him, especially with us being demanding and seemingly unappreciative.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on tools that will help protect the users/network from abusive or intrusive behaviour like we've seen from this crawler software, regardless of well things are or aren't communicated or what people's intentions are, so I do not consider the behaviour of those particular hosts gating here (though it should also be improved), but a rather just as a sign that there is some kind of persistent serious misunderstanding and miscommunication and that I'd rather not have a DNS seed operating under that.\r\n\r\nCheers. \r\n",

English is not my first language so that could be another reason? I'm still working on the crawler right now to avoid keeping connection. The only immediate gating issue for me is on the node alert feature on the Bitnodes site. The feature currently sends an alert to subscribed node owner as soon as it is disconnected from the crawler, so I will have to think of another way to do this. If you have thoughts about this or any issues regarding the crawler, please feel free to let me know (ayeowch@gmail.com).\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I am now less than comfortable having my DNS seeder in the reference implementation so let's proceed to ACK the removal for now.\r\n",

Rather than just targeting Addy's service specifically if this is really the highest priority it'd be better to come up with a specific policy and provide notice to seed operators, time for transition etc.\r\n\r\n3) Even if we accept the rationale that removing seeds as 'punishment' is a good way to effect change, Addy has now modified his crawler but the commit was merged anyway.
