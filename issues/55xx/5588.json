The block 336371 is not in the database, but I think it is still putting new blocks beyond that into the database.\r\n\r\nI have the bitcoind still running if someone has suggestions how to debug this, further.  I don't depend on it and haven't tried yet if restarting solves the problem.\r\n\r\nI have the relay node client from Matt Corallo running, which feeds the local bitcoind with blocks and transactions from the relay network.\r\n\r\n*Update*: I noticed that the block 336370 that was accepted is the orphaned block 000000000000000000929bbefb29a690c8913b3c066946d998bfd7c5426fb5e7.",
