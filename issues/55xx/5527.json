Once we're using vboxmanage anyway, replace the multi-step process of\r\nadding the port forwarding rule (and 2 images) with the one-line command\r\nto do the same thing.\r\n\r\nNote that this guide may not work in other ways, for other reasons -- for\r\nexample, with the new depends system, stuff may need to change. I haven't\r\ngotten around to looking at the changes to gitian building in depth, so I\r\ndon't know how much needs to be fixed/rewritten.",
