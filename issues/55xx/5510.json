After the initial build change, they are independent.\r\n\r\nMost extensive changes are in **'src/serialize.h: base serialization level endianness neutrality'**. I had to replace READDATA and WRITEDATA with functions that take sized integer types to make use of the proper `endian.h` functions. I'm confident that the end result is the same, although this may require more tests.\r\n\r\nI've tested this on mipsbe32. \r\n\r\n- All tests pass\r\n- Testnet syncs correctly\r\n- Node can successfully function on P2P mainnet\r\n- Checked that data directory can be copied between endians with no adverse results (only peers.dat required special attention here)\r\n\r\nKnown issues (to be fixed before merge):\r\n\r\n- ~~DNS seeding always comes with 0 results on BE~~ (confirmed as working by @paveljanik on real hardware, must have been issue with my qemu-user setup)\r\n",
