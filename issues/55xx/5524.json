When this fails, an includeWatching attempt is made.\r\n\r\nWhen an includeWatching attempt at coin selection is performed (in CreateTransaction), and all watchonlys are consumed leaving no funds available for a fee, then CreateTransaction will not include a fee in the transaction.\r\n\r\nAlso, includeWatching tests (for fundrawtransaction) added here are passing.\r\n\r\nReviewers! Here are some things I would especially appreciate eyelooking for: suggestions for more edge cases for the tests, other RPC commands that should be tested, other tests for other features that I should double check for whether or not this makes any impacts, locations or existence of any sort of documentation I should be updating, unintended side effects introduced in CreateTransaction like by multiple parameters that may eventually be used simultaneously in ways that I am failing to anticipate....\r\n\r\nI received a few suggestions from others that SignSignature should be replaced with an estimator in CreateTransaction. However, this estimator apparently does not seem to be necessary for implementing watchonly-support here, so this suggestion may go into another ticket instead.\r\n\r\nThis requires #5503 to be merged (I wouldn't mind this getting merged into #5503).\r\n",
