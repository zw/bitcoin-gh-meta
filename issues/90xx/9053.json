   "body" : "This introduces a 'minimum chain work' chainparam which is intended\r\n to be the known amount of work in the chain for the network at the\r\n time of software release.  If you don't have this much work, you're\r\n not yet caught up.\r\n    \r\nThis is used instead of the count of blocks test from checkpoints.\r\n\r\nThis criteria is trivial to keep updated as there is no element of\r\n subjectivity, trust, or position dependence to it. It is also a more\r\n reliable metric of sync status than a block count.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step in a larger change to eliminate checkpoints\r\n completely, but it's independently a good idea.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes IsInitialBlockDownload no longer use header-only timestamps.\r\n\r\nThis avoids a corner case (mostly visible on testnet) where bogus\r\n headers can keep nodes in IsInitialBlockDownload.",
