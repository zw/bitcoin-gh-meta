There were no test cases that caused crashes, but there was:\r\n\r\n* A test case that showed UniValue improperly accepting a non-minimal utf8 sequence (`C0 AF`)\r\n* A test case that showed UniValue returning a partial parsing of a json input with an embedded nul byte (`'\\0'`)\r\n* Some test cases that failed because of missing features in UniValue: utf16 decoding, support for reading plain number and string values not embedded in objects or arrays.\r\n\r\nI created a PR at https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/pull/1 with a few commits fixing the various issues. Not sending the PR upstream for now, because it's not clear which of the changes might be desirable to keep permanently.\r\n\r\n",

We actually have workarounds in place to do \"lonely\" JSON value parsing: `ParseNonRFCJSONValue` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/client.h#L12 . Would be great if upstream just supported it.",
