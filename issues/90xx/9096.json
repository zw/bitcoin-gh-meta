   "body" : "Hello. I noticed that there are a lot of repeated warnings when compiling Core under macOS (formerly OS X) 10.12. Here are a couple of examples.\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn file included from leveldb/util/cache.cc:10:\r\nIn file included from ./leveldb/port/port.h:14:\r\nIn file included from ./leveldb/port/port_posix.h:47:\r\n./leveldb/port/atomic_pointer.h:55:3: warning: 'OSMemoryBarrier' is deprecated: first deprecated in macOS 10.12 - Use\r\n      std::atomic_thread_fence() from <atomic> instead [-Wdeprecated-declarations]\r\n  OSMemoryBarrier();\r\n  ^\r\n/usr/include/libkern/OSAtomicDeprecated.h:749:9: note: 'OSMemoryBarrier' has been explicitly marked deprecated here\r\nvoid    OSMemoryBarrier( void );\r\n        ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nleveldb/util/logging.cc:58:40: warning: comparison of integers of different signs: 'const int' and 'unsigned long long' [-Wsign-compare]\r\n          (v == kMaxUint64/10 && delta > kMaxUint64%10)) {\r\n                                 ~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second warning seems relatively harmless. The first worries me a little bit, though. Does anybody know offhand if this has been fixed upstream, and if it should be pulled down? I suppose the problem is that I don't know what the policy is towards warnings in Core. At an old company, warnings in our code were treated like errors, while third-party code was left alone whenever possible. (Removing all the warnings from millions of lines of code just isn't feasible.)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Latest version still has the problem. [Looks like somebody has pointed this out to the team](https://github.com/google/leveldb/issues/415). I'll see if I can get a PR filed and get things sped up a bit.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2**: I [filed a patch](https://github.com/google/leveldb/pull/422).",
