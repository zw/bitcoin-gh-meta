   "body" : "> This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening, and a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the -listenonion, -torcontrol and -torpassword settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass -debug=tor.\r\n\r\nBut it is correct to say that the feature is enabled *regardless* of whether a connection to Tor can be made.\r\n\r\nI propose to clarify that so that users can eliminate these in their logs (when `listen=1` and no Tor).\r\nAnd I think it's okay to clarify about the `listen` option, because on several occasions when I read this before I always assumed `listening` meant `server=1` which cost me a lot of time in troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-10-24 06:19:22.551029 tor: Error connecting to Tor control socket\r\n2016-10-24 06:19:22.551700 tor: Not connected to Tor control port 127.0.0.1:9051, trying to reconnect\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.12.1",
