Im running on 0.13.1 for three days now and after every reconnect it stucks with 8 connections and on bitnodes the node is showed open on check but on activation reported as down.\r\nRestarting core solves the problem until the next reconnect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Bananian\r\nBanana PI M1\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nI can provide the debug.log for help after working day is done\r\n",
