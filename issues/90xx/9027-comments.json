      "body" : "This was partially addressed in #9208. However, the issue of keeping around all blocks connected in the ConnectTrace still exists. Note that, of course, this does not present an issue during normal connect since a ConnectTrace should only ever contain one block (as ABCS will return if it made progress).\r\n\r\n#10286 will present yet another issue here. Because wallet callbacks will not force the ABC thread to pause, callbacks could pile up and even if blocks get freed from the ConnectTrace, they could still sit around in memory waiting for the callback to finish. Luckily since wallet also takes cs_main there is some ability to block the main thread from making progress, assuming locks will switch between threads and not always get taken on the same thread if there is contention, but hopefully eventually wallet can lose much of its cs_main-taking, which means wallet needs a way to pause validation if it is super, super huge and gets far behind.",
