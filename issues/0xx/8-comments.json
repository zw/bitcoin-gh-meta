Rather than sign an arbitrary message (which is generally frowned on by those smarter than me at cryptography; as I recall, a carefully-crafted message can make it easier to perform certain types of known-plaintext attacks)... um, where was I? Oh, yeah, what about adding specific RPC commands to issue a specific message? For example, if you want to prove you own(ed) a particular coin, you could issue a command something like \"getproofofownership <address>\". Of course, under the hood that would be implemented using a routine that signs a message string, but the contents of the message string would be under the program's control.\r\n\r\nThat would also force us to think through the specific use-cases for which this feature is needed.",
