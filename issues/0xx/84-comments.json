For the user, it should feel like moving value between wallets (like a transaction, but without the need for it to enter the block chain and possibly incur fees).  The wallets should be both presumed to be active, hence you would only want a given key to exist in one active wallet at a time.  This feature should not be viewed as a backup mechanism.",

We'd need an input field to paste in the transaction (which is really just a key pair).  It's really just export/import with the official client by default deleting the private key on export (possibly with a huge warning to make sure you copied the text somewhere safe).  It makes sense to work on this feature after a mechanism for controlling which coins get included in a transaction, since the user will want to know how many coins are at a specific address before sending off the private key (to another wallet or another person).\n\nAppropriate new API calls should be created too.",
