   "body" : "I'm opening this for a blind bitcoin user:\r\n\r\nThere are a couple concerns I have with the accessibility of the GUI in Bitcoin. The \"Send Coins\" and \"Addressbook\" buttons are not in the tabstop list, so a blind person with a screen reader cannot tab to and activate these buttons. Also, the current address and balance are also not accessible via pressing tab. When arrowing through the list of transactions, the screen reader, rather than starting out with the status (number of confirmations), reads a long number, usually starting out with 00. If you wait long enough, the rest of the table is read, but unfortunately that is a while to wait.\r\n\r\nAlso, when bringing up transaction details, there is an html window displayed, but absolutely no feedback is given from the screen reader. Last, in the addressbook, tabbing from control to control works fine, but when shift-tabbing, only the list and tab control are tabbed to.\r\n\r\nOf course, most of these concerns, excluding the HTML window which isn't read at all, are not a big deal for myself, as I'm a power user and can use my screen reader's review cursor to read most of the controls. However, there are many blind people who find this method of exploring windows confusing (many will ask \"how did you know that was there?\"), and these fixes will make it easier for them to explore the Bitcoin interface on their own and use it successfully.\r\n\r\nThe screen reader I'm using is NVDA, a free and open source screen reader, which can be found at http://www.nvda-project.org.\r\n",
