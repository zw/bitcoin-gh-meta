And building the actual message communication into core bitcoin may not be the right approach.\r\n\r\nUse cases to design for:\r\n\r\n+ Store wants to send anonymous customer information on status of an order they paid for a while ago. (example: \"free upgrade for the software you bought last week is available\" or \"warning: the file you downloaded yesterday has been reported to contain malware\")\r\n  -- what about possiblity of spam?\r\n\r\n+ Customer wants to send authenticated message about a payment they sent (example: \"I messed up the shipping address, please send to '123 main street' instead of '213 main street'\" or \"the file I just got from you contains a virus\")\r\n\r\n\r\nBitcoin knows how to sign transactions with the public key corresponding to a bitcoin address; the key feature needed is, Gavin thinks, authentication: are you *really* communicating with the sender/receiver of *bitcoin address*?   Perhaps bitcoin could support a function \"please sign this arbitrary stuff with *bitcoin address for which you have the private key* and return the digital signature\"; that might be sufficient to integrate with existing secure messaging infrastructure (like PGP email).\r\n",
