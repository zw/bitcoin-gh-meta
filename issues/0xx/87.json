I envision a time when I will retire or loose or otherwise want to move a receiving address from one bitcoin client to another.  It would be nice to have an easy way to export a public/private keypair from one client and import it in another.  Perhaps there'd even be a way to email them or send them between two client's RPC channels.  \r\n\r\nA followup to this is to also be able to share my bitcoin address book for outgoing payments that I send to others.
