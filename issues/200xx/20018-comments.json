      "body" : "Great question, @robot-dreams!\r\n\r\nWith `-connect=X -dnsseed=1`, `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` uses some domains owned by contributors (see `CMainParams`) to expand the peers in `addrman`. If `-proxy` is set, or if a seed domain does not support `x9.domain` (which tests for `NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS`), `getaddr` calls are made to a peer dns seed resolves to. i.e. `ADDR_FETCH` connections to an address that a dees like `dnsseed.emzy.de` resolves to. Otherwise (and this is mostly the case), DNS _resolved_ addresses are used as peer candidates in `addrman`. So, sometimes, DNS seeds act as seednodes (eg. in `-proxy` mode) requiring a further `getaddr` call (this case is affected by removing the `ProcessAddrFetch()` call), but mostly, they directly dns resolve to peers which support `NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS` (this case is unaffected).\r\n\r\n> if someone manually sets -dnsseed, so that the SoftSetBoolArg doesn't do anything, is it also worth printing a warning in that case?\r\n\r\nYes, I think it's worth adding a warning for the case: `-connect=X -dnsseed=1 -proxy=Y`. I've added it.\r\n\r\nRebased with master.",

The underlying issue is how can the assert know that something did _not_ happen for sure? It either has to wait until the timeout, or until something that we are sure will happen after the unexpected thing _might_. \r\n\r\nAm I missing something?",

Instead, we connect to the peer that the DNS seed currently resolves to - which is basically just a random node on the network not under the control of the DNS seed operator, and it changes every once in a while (~30minutes?) for a given DNS seed.\r\nSince this is a common misconception, I think it would be good to describe it not just here in the test code, but also in `net` (If you'd prefer not to do it here, I could open a PR).",

Thoughts?\r\n\r\nOops, missed this. I agree, fingerprinting is another good reason. I think in practice we'd often trust the node we `-connect` to more than a random peer, and if this is our only connection to the network, the peer could guess this anyway by the lack of transactions / blocks /addresses we advertise to them.\r\nIn general, it is probably not worth optimizing `-connect` mode too much by adding conditionals at various spots in `net_processing` just to save a few bytes of bandwidth or memory here and there, because it's a rather special-purpose way of running a node used only in rare occasions.\r\n\r\n",
