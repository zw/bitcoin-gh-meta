Extra block access is really NOT an issue.\r\n\r\nRE: not being able to prune to less than 100+plausible-re-org-depth: I'm OK with 120 being the minimum number of blocks a pruning node needs to keep. If we REALLY want to support pruning down lower, then storing the hash of the coinbase transactions in the block indices would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nRE: easier to allow immature in mempool: I really don't like the idea of relaxing the invariant of \"every transaction in the mempool is ready to be mined.\" Certainly this code is simpler than that alternative. I also think we'll have to optimize CreateBlock fairly soon, which will probably mean a mempool rewrite to maintain a priority queue of transactions-- so creating a block is just \"pop off queue until block full.\"\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt : including more thorough CheckInputs is a good idea, but I don't think I'll have time to do that until Monday (out for Thanksgiving).\r\n\r\nRE: run check() after reorgs are complete comment:  theoretically, you can reorg onto a more-work chain that has a lower height. That will never happen on the main network, but I hate to say never and I think we should be as robust as possible at all the edge cases we can think up.\r\n",

My point is more that I see #5267 as more obviously robust (instead of removing just the transactions we know we need to with a scalpel, we use a hammer and scan through the whole mempool to find the ones we need to remove) and performance isnt really a reason to chose this over that.",
