As far as I could find the only change is in rpcsignrawtransaction and preventing signing of double spends (now also when the inputs are in the chain) and maybe that's ok?   You can see this by switching the order of the `tx2 = ...` and `spend_id = ...` lines in the included rpc test.  Switching them will work prior to this change, but not with it.",
