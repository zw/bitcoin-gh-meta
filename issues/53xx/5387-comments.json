Could the script be parameterized to just clang-format the files of a specific commit?\r\n\r\nYes, that would be interesting as an option. However, I think we want to get into a state where most of the code, most of the time, is mostly according to clang-format standards already, and re-applying the script (it takes 1.2s here) to the whole tree should be mostly a no-op anyway.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the resulting state is that there are always a few commits merged in that broke coding style, you don't want to independent pull requests to go clean those up automatically. Your suggestion is one way to avoid that. Another is to just periodically (and perhaps automatically) have a pull request created that applies coding style fixes.",
