      "body" : "Apparently doing `codesign_allocate` before the actual code signing causes `codesign` to fail. This is because the tool detects that there is supposed to be a signature there. It then attempts to parse the signature and verify it. However because it is just 0's, it fails to do this and errors. To work around this issue, after doing `codesign_allocate`, we can apply a bogus signature. Since we pass the `-f`/`--force` option to `codesign` already, this bogus signature will be overwritten with the correct signature during actual signing. But because a validly formatted signature is present, `codesign` does not error when it encounters the bogus signature. For the bogus signature, I am just using the rc3 signature. This bogus signature is only attached to the binary that the codesigner signs, not the unsigned binary that we upload.\r\n\r\nI was able to test the entire process using a self-signed certificate. The initial gitian build works, I was able to sign create the detached signature, the Gitian signer build works, and the resulting binary validates. I also did a sign of the unmodified unsigned binary. This had a different `vmsize` than the final result`, indicating that this trick will work.\r\n\r\nGitian build results:\r\n```\r\nc587da1413ef8f942b4fb90bd077c93b883cfdcaf86c1965ba63ba83eabd0601  bitcoin-7f9d623e0210-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n3fcfd6cf91018a0afeefec43bc226eb61eed5d2cd41aa7880be3700abf8555cd  bitcoin-7f9d623e0210-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n2b01414c875ac85e79dbb5df4eff863db29e99be8a0eec43fb1e9940298b4d3f  bitcoin-7f9d623e0210-osx64.tar.gz\r\na017e7c291f81dd16b24368dc513303b65deb71d5d144f3726facee03605eb08  src/bitcoin-7f9d623e0210.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the signature tarball if anyone wants to test the attaching: [signature-osx.tar.gz](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/5685822/signature-osx.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nSigned binary result:\r\n```\r\n28c5fe82d1a93d096059e7a35a57286c28f57b21b7688dc523df39d211c17ae1  bitcoin-osx-signed.dmg\r\n```",
