Every new glibc version that build OSes ship with means more work to add workarounds and wrappers. This is not a sustainable situation, and it is highly unconventional too: apparently the expected behavior is that when building against a certain glibc, you get a build that is compatible with the version you built with, and later, but not earlier.\n\nYou have two options:\n* Build using your own environment, and get a build compatible with your environment.\n* Build using the release build system (now guix based), which constructs a controlled environment designed to be compatible with all major distros.\n\nNothing is taken away, and nothing requires a dozen chroots.",

Use X it is better than JAVA everyone can have Linux - Bill does a great job but the market competition can press up...), and I can think of the reasons even then why a build system for release might be private as long as it could be trusted. I will try GUIX and see if I can at least get up to portable. I have GitLab now privately so I can clone on the Fedora 28 system and try and build at lease self-contained there probably.
