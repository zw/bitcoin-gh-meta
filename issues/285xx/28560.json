   "body" : "## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this PR is to enable `FundTransaction` to take a vector of `CRecipient` objects to allow passing BIP352 silent payment addresses to RPCs that use `FundTransaction` (e.g. `send`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`). To do that, SFFO logic needs to be moved out of `FundTransaction` so the `CRecipient` objects with the correct SFFO information can be created and then passed to `FundTransaction`.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary motivation, this PR moves the SFFO stuff closer to the caller, making the code cleaner and easier to understand. This is done by having a single function which parses RPC inputs for SFFO and consistently using the `set<int>` method for communicating SFFO.\r\n\r\nI'm also not convinced we need to pass a full `CMutableTx` object to `FundTransaction`, but I'm leaving that for a follow-up PR/discussion, as its not a blocker for silent payments.",
