   "body" : "Originally, this PR fixed a wallet migration bug that could cause the watchonly wallet created by legacy wallet migration to have incorrect transaction height values. A different fix for the bug was implemented in #28609, but that PR did not add any test coverage that would have caught the bug, and didn't include other changes from this PR intended to prevent problems from invalid transaction heights.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new asserts to catch invalid transaction heights, which would trigger test failures without bugfix in #28609. This PR also refactors code and adds comments to clarify assumptions and make it less likely a bug from invalid transaction height values would be introduced.",
