      "body" : "This seems promising, but it isn't exactly implementing what's described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16220#issuecomment-1429962692 or the PR description so it has a different set of advantages and disadvantages. \r\n\r\nThe difference between code and PR description is that code is not implementing: _\"If list is empty wallet should create `<datadir>/wallets` as a directory, otherwise it should create it as a symlink pointing to `.`\"_. Because of this, the PR can't simplify the [`GetWalletDir` ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/04265ba9378efbd4c35b33390b1e5cf246d420a9/src/wallet/walletutil.cpp#L11-L31) function so it still needs to check existence `<datadir>/wallets` and can't just return it unconditionally.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is ok, and the PR is still worthwhile, because it at least it simplifies the node code, even if it doesn't simplify the wallet code, and it makes the separation cleaner because node code no longer explicitly needs to create the \"wallets\" directory and can avoid creating it if the wallet is disabled.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of not creating ` \"wallets\" -> \".\"` symlink is that startup might be a little slower in a data directory that has wallets in the top level, since `ListDatabases().empty()` will be checked every time on startup, instead of just one time when symlink doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nOther notes about the PR:\r\n\r\n- It is suspicious why wallet functional tests need to be changed. This change should be backwards compatible so it is surprising that tests should have to change in order to pass. It would be good to have an explanation for that.\r\n- I'm not sure if we currently have a test explicitly written to cover loading a datadir with no `wallets/` subdirectory and wallets in the top-level directory. If there is not an existing test, probably one should be written to make sure code in this PR doesn't break and wallets can still be loaded there.\r\n- This PR isn't removing qt code that creates the \"wallets\" directory: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bf32ae3969833c767b2c88d4c7f609a569c7effe/src/qt/intro.cpp#L245, which should no longer be necessary, after the other changes.\r\n- I think it would be better if this PR did not add a `g_wallet_init_interface.InitWalletDir` function, and instead just changed existing `VerifyWallets` function which is already determining the wallet directory. Getting rid of it would be nicer just to have fewer init functions, but also this code doesn't belong in WalletInit class because with #10102 WalletInit wallet/init.cpp functions are run in the node process, not the wallet process.\r\n\r\n",
