To manually test this, I ran `-reindex-chainstate` on Ubuntu, and watched memory usage by printing `/proc/pid/statm` and watching the `data` (6th) field. On master, the value settled to 315140 (units are 4k pages); with this PR it was 315606, which indicates that the new version produces slightly smaller results, but they're close.",
