It also encapsulates the global minRelayTxFee behind the CPolicy interface.\r\nSince this may be too disruptive for one PR, I was very careful to separate things in smaller commits.\r\nThe first commit, for example, may be useful for @jonasschnelli 's work encapsulating the wallet.\r\n\r\nThis is also intended to replace @morcos' #7557, #6068 and #5114.",
