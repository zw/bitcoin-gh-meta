   "body" : "With concerns about OpenSSL's RNG increasing, we should just always require OS randomness in addition to our normal randomness source when generating keys. This is an infrequent operation (especially since signing was switched to using deterministic nonces), so this should not hurt performance at all.\r\n\r\nIn addition, get rid of the random calls to RandAddPerfMonData, which were generally correlated with places where keys or signatures were generated. Better just do it whenever we actually need that kind of assurance.\r\n\r\nThis does add a dependency from random on crypto, which makes bitcoin-cli now link in crypto. That's unfortunate, and the randomness utilities should probably moved to a different lib, but I'm not doing that now.",
