It was inspired by noticing that mapBlockSource\r\nis redundant with mapBlocksInFlight -- mapBlocksInFlight already\r\ncontains a mapping from blockhash to peer id.\r\n\r\nmapBlockSource was used to DoS-ban peers that send us bad blocks,\r\nbut the banning logic was sometimes broken-- InvalidBlockFound\r\ncould DoS ban, and then another ban for the same bad block would\r\nbe applied in ProcessMessages. Just removing mapBlockSource is\r\nthe simplest fix.\r\n\r\nThere is a corner case where a peer might have been banned before,\r\nbut will not get banned now: if we get an out-of-order block\r\nfrom a peer that double-spends an output spent in a previous block\r\nthat we don't yet have. The requirement that the block have valid\r\nproof-of-work prevents this from being a practical DoS attack.\r\n\r\nProcessNewBlock loses it's *pfrom argument, which is nice--\r\nProcessNewBlock shouldn't care about networking stuff.",
