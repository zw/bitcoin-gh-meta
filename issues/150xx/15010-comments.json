And that you be able to adjust the threshold for confirmed and turn the trusted-in-mempool-zeroconf on and off. And if you make the confirmed=0, it should still only count in-mempool\r\n\r\nIt seems like this PR is addressing the problem in a different way. Instead of treating not fully confirmed spends from the wallet as trusted (and therefore including change in the balance), it is treating not fully confirmed spends as actually unspent (and therefore including the whole output value in the balance)?\r\n\r\nIt's possible I'm confused, but it would help if there was an explanation of how this fix relates to previous discussion (or doesn't relate, if it is just a tangential bugfix).",

From that PR:\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, CWallet::GetBalance (the trusted-only implementation) did not support setting a min_conf parameter. This was added in #13566, but only checked min_conf for UTXO creation, not UTXO spending.\r\n\r\nI don't understand Luke's assertion that the getbalance value should be 9.99 and -10.01. Displaying negative balance doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour should now be that when calling `getbalance` with a minconf value:\r\n- coins that have received but have fewer than minconf confirmations are excluded\r\n- coins that have been spent but have fewer than minconf confirmations are included\r\n\r\nEffectively, this gives the balance at (TIP - minconf) height.\r\n\r\nThat behaviour makes sense to me, and I think best reflects the description in the RPC help for minconf: \"Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.\" It was what I understood commit 1ac717f8d836b16d5cb808c07f0578a309f4e9d0 in #14602 was attempting.\r\n\r\nIf people disagree that this is the desired behaviour, then I can amend or close this PR.

E.g. if I received 5 BTC at depth 3 and spent 4 BTC at depth 2, would getbalance(minconf=3) would show a balance of 1 before this PR and 5 after?\r\n\r\nYou need to consider the UTXO model here, rather than just balances. Here's your scenario:\r\n\r\ndepth 3: receive a 5 BTC UTXO (a)\r\ndepth 2: spend the 5 BTC UTXO (a)\r\n                    - create a 4 BTC payment UTXO (b)\r\n                    - receive a 1 BTC change UTXO (c)\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `getbalance(minconf=3)` would show a balance of **0**: (a) is not included because it has been spent, and (c) is not included because it does not have the necessary number of confirmations. After this PR, `getbalance(minconf=3)` would show a balance of 5, because (a) has the necessary number of confirmations and (b) and (c) don't.\r\n\r\n@sipa:\r\n\r\n> I think we've always counted balance as the sum of incoming UTXOs with sufficient confirmations, but which haven't been spent afterwards (even with lower confirmations).\r\n\r\nIn the scenario above, would you include the change output (c) in your balance? ie amend your definition to be: (sum of incoming UTXOs with sufficient confirmations which haven't been spent afterwards) + (sum of change UTXOs). In that case, should I count change transactions where the input UTXO has fewer confirmations than `minconf`?\r\n\r\nTo me, a balance in Bitcoin can only make sense at a given block (ie given the UTXO set associated with this block, what is the total amount of UTXOs that I can sign for?) Any alternative definition (eg the amount of UTXOs that I can sign for less those UTXOs where I have evidence they can be spent, etc) leads to confusing inconsistencies like the example above.",
