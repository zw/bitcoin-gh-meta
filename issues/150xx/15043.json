   "body" : "Currently our fuzzer is a single binary that decides on the first few bits of the buffer what target to pick. This is ineffective as the fuzzer needs to \"learn\" how the fuzz targets are organized and could get easily confused. Not to mention that the (seed) corpus can not be categorized by target, since targets might \"leak\" into each other. Also the corpus would potentially become invalid if we ever wanted to remove a target...\r\n\r\nSolve that by building each fuzz target into their own executable.",
