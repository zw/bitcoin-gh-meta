   "body" : "Multi-wallet support is a very nice feature.  However, it makes using `bitcoin-cli`manually a bit cumbersome, as one always has to type `-rpcwallet=foo` for each command.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of allowing to choose the wallet through an environment variable, e.g. `BITCOINCLI_WALLET`?  In other words, if `-rpcwallet` is not specified but this variable is set, use the wallet specified in the variable.  That way, the wallet could be chosen once e.g. in a shell session and then shorter commands could be used in the follow-up.\r\n\r\nOf course, this only applies to explicit manual usage of `bitcoin-cli`.  Programmatic users (either using the RPC interface directly or calling `bitcoin-cli`) do not really have any benefit from such a change.  Also, as an alternative, one can use a shell `alias` instead.  But I think it might still be nice to have this (from my own experience).  If others agree, I'm happy to implement this.",
