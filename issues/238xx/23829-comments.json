I think this is fine to do because:\r\n* C++11 braced init is safer, since it has more compile time checks\r\n* This patch has no conflicts as of now\r\n* `bitcoind` is not changed by this patch. I checked `clang++ -O2` and `g++ -O2` on my system.\r\n\r\nInstead of linking to a pull request for context, I think OP can be improved to give a clear motivation. I think this patch is by itself worthwhile and should be considered independent of the other pull request.\r\n\r\nreview ACK 9db89e1efa4332109eb1cb53e153844797a60350\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I can also see a point about not changing existing code for style reasons, unless it is touched.",
