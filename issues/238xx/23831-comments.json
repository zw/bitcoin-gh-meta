As the skillset required for the project `Remove Automatic Creation of Legacy Descriptors` matches mine, I am very much eager to participate in the Summer of Bitcoin working on this project.\r\n\r\nAs per the competency test, I shall build the project and let you know soon. It will really help me a lot if you could let me know of any prerequisites or any other instructions important for the project. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to a great summer ahead.",

This is what I don't like and care about the issues so I am commenting. And there is nothing wrong with allowing users to create wallets with all types of descriptors. I do not agree with the opinion that this will help in efficient block usage.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is not an efficient financial network, its censorship resistant network where users should be allowed to do what they want. They could still import descriptors but default matters and affects the way people use core right now.",
