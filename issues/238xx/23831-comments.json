As the skillset required for the project `Remove Automatic Creation of Legacy Descriptors` matches mine, I am very much eager to participate in the Summer of Bitcoin working on this project.\r\n\r\nAs per the competency test, I shall build the project and let you know soon. It will really help me a lot if you could let me know of any prerequisites or any other instructions important for the project. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to a great summer ahead.",
