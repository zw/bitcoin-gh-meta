It's just a cleanup PR and should be no change in functionality.\r\n\r\nPreviously the minReasonableRelayFee which was passed through CTxMempool to CBlockPolicyEstimator was just getting its statically initialized value of DEFAULT_MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE so this PR shortcuts passing it through for no reason.\r\n\r\nIt's perfectly fine to have a smaller min bucket feerate in fee estimation, it is just slightly less space efficient.  However changing this number invalidates old fee estimate files..  So we change the hardcoded minimum rate to be the same rate that was being passed in previously (1000 from DEFAULT_MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE) and we can worry about changing it in the future if that ever becomes not small enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n@theuni ",
