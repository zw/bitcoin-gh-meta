But this simple change in defaults really makes it \"Opt-out\" and will end up causing huge impacts to people who are currently relying on 0-conf transactions, as suddenly everyone is going to be accidentally sending \"opt-in\" RBF.\n\nBitcoin Core is a relatively small wallet when it comes to consumer transactions. I think this is far from a large concern. On the flip side, if we ship a \"bumpfee\" option in 0.14, it'd be super confusing to users if it by default doesn't work. There are way more user complaints about a transaction not confirming than there are about a payment not happening instantly (because users have seen \"confirmations\" since they started using bitcoin, and the vast majority of consumer Bitcoin use requires confirmations).\n\n> For what it's worth, I've tried using bip125 for \"fee bumping\" but is pretty much sucks for most normal cases. For anti-dos reasons, you generally have to 2x the fees, which is often a huge waste of money.\n\nThis seems strange. The min relay fee you should have to pay is relatively small. Are you looking at relay or are you looking at mining-time? (Many pools currently lose a few tens or hundreds of dollars by still not mining Opt-in RBF).\n\n> And it doesn't work to prioritize incoming transactions. On the other hand CPFP gives much finer grain control, doesn't break transaction chains, works on incoming transactions and has the nice property of not screwing anyone (although it has a caveat that it requires you always use a change address).\n\nCPFP, on the other hand, always does require something like 2x fees :(. Obviously there are use cases for both depending on which party of the transaction you are, but the massive increase in user fee and network cost to CPFP doesn't seem to merit the cost to very uncommon use-cases (which are free to require non-opt-in RBF transactions at their own risk).\n\n> Anyway, this change won't actually impact me as I don't accept 0-confs -- but the whole thing strikes me as needlessly antagonistic.\n\nI'd look at it a different way - given the lack of community cohesion, full blocks aren't going away, and random spikes resulting in user complaints are easily solved by this and simple bumpfee utility (and much cheaper and more flexibly than CPFP).\n\nObviously I'd agree we shouldn't do this unless bumpfee goes in.\n\nOn January 12, 2017 9:51:07 PM PST, Luke Dashjr <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>@RHavar has a point too.

I listed reasons earlier why CPFP has been strictly better, more flexible and _significantly_ cheaper (when I do a CPFP, I use a transaction I was going to make anyway so there's almost no extra fee overhead). The only edge case I've found so far is just when sending a transaction it doesn't have a change address (which is actually exceedingly rare, due to a bug in the coin selection)",

      "body" : "@RHavar  The reading may be more clear to some due to understanding the motivation: The reason it works the way it does is so that RBF doesn't allow an attacker to use any more relay bandwidth than they could use without RBF (e.g. creating additional transactions at the minrelayfee rate). So that means that every bump just needs to increase by the minimum rate that would have caused relay-- the rate already used so far isn't relevant.  RBFing should be unconditionally less expensive than CPFP, usually considerably so-- especially if you use it to combine what would have been a chain of several transactions, it can easily be three or more times cheaper (and less network resource hungry) to use replacement. \r\n\r\nAs far as your zero-conf comments, that is why my comment here and on the bumpfee PR talk about being able to after-the-fact turn it off.  Though in the last couple months of helping people with slow transactions I've never had a double spend of a non-RBF transaction take more than three blocks to confirm, and usually they're confirmed in the next block; so I'm dubious that it makes any real difference for zero-conf safety, but just in case I think it's also important to have an instant option to flip it off on a txn the user has already sent.

      "body" : "@instagibbs because this feature comes with significant negative repercussions. At the moment merchants can (and do) accept 0-conf transaction if they take adequate precautions, such as making sure the transaction fully propagates and has a decent mining fee. (It's even used in risky businesses like casinos, where a double-spend success rate of 1% would be enough to be profitable).\r\n\r\nUsing bip125 transactions generally require merchants to wait for an +1 confirmation, which results in a worse user experience. So if we're going to do that, it only makes sense that users get the benefit of bip125 (being able to fee bump).\r\n\r\nLikewise it would also make sense to have \"reverttransaction\" as a prerequisite too. It would help people fully realize how revertible bip125 transactions are, while providing actual utility (e.g. about a week ago through a mishap with ctrl+r'ing through my bash history, I accidentally resent someone 1 bitcoin. The ability to revert that would've been extremely useful).\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I find it a bit tasteful that bip125 was heavily advertising and promoting the controversial feature as \"opt-in\" (which is even in the name of the BIP) and now quietly being changing it to \"opt-out\".  But as I mentioned, I think it could be justified if users get enough utility from it  (which imo would mean reliable fee bumping, and reliable transaction reverting)",

Obviously that's a rather horrible experience, but it's been extremely rare (and the fee estimation in 0.15 is set to be a lot more responsive, making that even less of a problem) with me estimating there's only ever really been two ~15-30m windows like that before. \r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen the bulk of users affected from being stuck in the perpetual backlog have been blockchain.info and coins.ph users. A change in core's defaults isn't going to help them.\r\n\r\nSo at least in my personal opinion, it's premature to bring all the negative effects of default bip125 to the entire bitcoin ecosystem without even at first even giving the users who are creating the transactions all the benefits (reliable fee bumps, and undos).",
