(Using `GetTimeMicros()` for `nLastRecv` is newly introduced in the commit above.)\r\n\r\nReally, it's sort of remarkable/lucky that we didn't have test failures relating to how mocktime interacts with the networking code before.  I'm not sure what the right way to fix this is -- I started by trying to narrowly just fix this issue by changing `nTimeConnected`, `nLastSend`, and the starting `nTime` used in the inactivity check to all be based off system clock (eg `GetTimeMicros()/1000000`), but then that broke some of our other tests that I think must have been relying on mocktime having an effect on some of these things (`maxuploadtarget.py`, `receivedby.py`, and `listtransactions.py` all failed -- I didn't investigate exactly what happened so it's possible my fix just had a simple mistake).\r\n\r\nAnyway I think we need a thoughtful approach to how to use `GetTime()` vs. `GetTimeMicros()` for the various times we have, especially in `net.cpp`/`net_processing.cpp`, and this is a bug that I think we need to fix for 0.14 so we're not shipping broken tests.\r\n",
