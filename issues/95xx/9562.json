   "body" : "### Issue\r\nI was running node version 0.13.2 (official binary package Linux 64 bit) that had banned a IPv4 address, e.g. 1.2.3.4\r\nI wanted to whitelist that address, so I added the option \r\n`whitelist=1.2.3.4`\r\nto bitcoin.conf and restarted the node. But the whitelisted address still showed up as banned in the GUI debug connections tab.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nI expected the now whitelisted address not to be banned after startup.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nAddress matching the new whitelist option pattern is still banned, showing up in the GUI debug window tab \"remote peers\" in a banned nodes section, with a button \"Unban node\".\r\nSo I clicked that button to manually unban the address.\r\nIt was lucky that I watched the connections debug tab in the GUI as a routine after startup. I was really surprised about seeing the just whitelisted address there as banned.",
