I guess it is because the file was deleted automatically after the `bitcoin-cli` process exited.\r\n\r\nMy `bitcoind` daemon was launched through `https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/init/bitcoind.service`. The owner of `bitcoind` process was `bitcoin` user, which does have writing permission for most directories.\r\n\r\nAm I always supposed to save the dump file into `datadir`?",
