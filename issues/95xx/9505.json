   "body" : "This is a minor performance optimization of prevector. If the stored type is trivially destructible (such as unsigned char which is the main use of prevector), there is no need to call clear on the entries before freeing.\r\n\r\nThe call to clear seems to not get optimized out completely (likely because of the `--_size;` side-effect) with `-O3`.\r\n\r\n`std::is_trivially_copyable` seems to enjoy full cross platform support.\r\n\r\nOn the included benchmark, I see about a 3% performance improvement.",
