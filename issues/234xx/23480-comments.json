The two drawbacks that I can think of.\r\n\r\n1) This one is listed in the BIP 341: If people directly use output keys in aggregation using proofs of knowledge.(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_ref-22-0)\r\n2) In future protocol constructions, it might be desirable to prove that there is no script path given TxOut/ScriptPubKey/Address. This is not possible when using rawtr(), but is possible with tr() by revealing the internal key.\r\n\r\nSome more points for discussion:\r\n\r\n- Can we separate descriptors into two types in the spec itself? So, we can have `addr`, `raw`, `rawtr` into the infer-only category. The rest into another category that we can sign. In the infer only category, we can restrict the KEY expression to be a concrete public key without any BIP32 derivations or wildcards.\r\n\r\n- Correct me if I am wrong if the only use of inferred descriptors is that I can give it another party for watching a particular txout for me without revealing/knowing how the txout was constructed. So, assuming we disallow signing `rawtr()` (to encourage the usage of `tr` ) is there is any use of `rawtr()` over `raw()`?  ",

Note that this protocol is not reviewed(and might be insecure), but I am starting to think we don't want to preclude people from using new ways to create output keys. In this protocol, it is still possible to prove that there is no script spend using a different way than revealing the internal key. Such proof is not required for the correctness above protocol, but it highlights that there might be other ways to prove the non-existence of script spend than revealing the internal key. \r\n\r\nAlthough as I mentioned later in response [comment]( https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/0ddb3a9cdec33342b97431e438252c0a#gistcomment-4013170), this can also be made compatible with `tr` descriptor. But doing so would be inefficient and it offers no benefit because we can already prove that there is no script spend. \r\n\r\nOverall, I am leaning towards a concept ACK for this.",
