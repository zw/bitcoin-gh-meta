Since #5981 it's even more mixed up. It's hard to get a overview of all possible test we have (thats why i extended `rpc-test.sh`).\r\n\r\nBasically: it's a mess.\r\n\r\nIMO messy qa/test setups end up in messy tests and bad test coverage. Therefore it should be clean at the root.\r\nThis simplifies the test setup and allow upcoming contributors to reduce the learn-curve of how a test should be written.",

      "body" : "Concept ACK.  I agree that the rpc-tests directory is a bit messy, and I have found it difficult in the past to just find all the tests that I can run.  Making ```rpc-tests.sh``` be a canonical place to put new scripts so others know to run them seems like a helpful thing which I plan to use.\r\n\r\nI don't have much opinion about how to best organize python code, but what you have done with the test_framework directory looks okay to me.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed -- I think ```script_test.py``` should probably be commented out of the extended test scripts.  Because it's just comparing behavior, it really doesn't make sense to run except with two different bitcoind binaries, which we don't have a way of doing in an automated way right now.  If the test were to give an error, it would almost certainly mean that the test is itself broken, and it's extremely slow to run.",
