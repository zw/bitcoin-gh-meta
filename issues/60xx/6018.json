Bitcoin can no longer continue safely and will quit.\nEXCEPTION: N5boost12interprocess22interprocess_exceptionE  \nNo such file or directory  \nbitcoin in Runaway exception\"\n\nI already tried \"./bitcoin-qt -debug\" and \"./bitcoin-qt --help-debug\" to no avail as the window with the error message pops up and there isn't anything else I can do.\n\nRegards.\n",
