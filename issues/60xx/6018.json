Bitcoin can no longer continue safely and will quit.\r\nEXCEPTION: N5boost12interprocess22interprocess_exceptionE       \r\nNo such file or directory       \r\nbitcoin in Runaway exception\"\r\n\r\nI already tried \"./bitcoin-qt -debug\" and \"./bitcoin-qt --help-debug\" to no avail as the window with the error message pops up and there isn't anything else I can do.\r\n\r\nRegards.",
