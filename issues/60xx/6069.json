Then I can have the advantages of the GUI, without having to worry about running it all the time, just to catch up with the blockchain.\n\nOn Windows, you could still have the unified Bitcoin Core installer, but you'd be able to point it to a remote instance of the daemon. Ideally, you'd be able to run the daemon as a service on Windows, or headless on Linux. (I think the latter is already happening with bitcoind, but IDK which clients can connect to it.)\n\nSorry I'm not totally clear yet on which aspects of this are already implemented, but it isn't all yet.\n",
