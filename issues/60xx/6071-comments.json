I would think any peer running on a mobile device has an accurate time.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I agree with @laanwj, network-recommended adjustment should be used only to warn the user to check his clock.\r\n\r\nThe original code said NTP was planned as the \"3rd chronometer\" but it would be a bad idea to turn bitcoind into an NTP client.  Leave it to the system operator to decide how to set his clock well.\r\n\r\nThe network will still \"vote\" on the correct time particularly with respect to blockTime validation -- but a remote attack vector against our clock is eliminated.",
