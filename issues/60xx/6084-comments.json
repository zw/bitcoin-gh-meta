Unclear if this is a bug though ...\r\n\r\nYes, same problem. And I agree with the reporter of that ticket- it's a bug if it's resulting in wallnetnotify script to be called for every transaction in the wallet, and not just the transactions belonging to the new key/address.\r\n\r\nEven if this bug and #6095 are resolved to only trigger notifications corresponding only to the specified key/address, running `bitcoind -rescan` will result in too many simultaneous processes. A thread pool would solve that, right?",
