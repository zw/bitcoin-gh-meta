This can be improved in the future. For example, the python script can exit after some time (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20752#discussion_r549248791). Alternatively, it can measure if coverage progress was made and run for less time if no progress has been made recently anyway, so that more time can be spent on targets that are new or still make progress.\r\n\r\n",
