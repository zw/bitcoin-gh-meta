I don't think this full-encryption you're proposing has a real use case.\r\n> \r\n> (What might make sense is to support fully encrypting backups.)\r\n\r\nI requested this because I have a real use case.. I run a full node that is on an unencrypted external drive. Bitcoin data is public data, it shouldn't be encrypted. I want to use the wallet for a watch-only wallet though. Unfortunately the wallet files live alongside the public blockchain data so I would have to store the wallet on an unencrypted drive (that I occasionally want to borrow out to friends for them to copy the blockchain in order not to have to download it). That would reveal my entire wallet to anyone that gets hold of this drive.\r\n\r\nSame would hold for a laptop. The blockchain is public data, encrypting it entirely is just a pointless performance loss. So it should always be stored on an unencrypted disk for performance reasons. But then you can't use the wallet. Even an encrypted wallet (currently only encrypting the private keys) leaks your entire wallet's history.",
