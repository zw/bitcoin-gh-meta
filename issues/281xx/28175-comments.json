Content the AI obtained somewhere else without permission (i.e. claims from the original author)\r\n\r\n2. Content the AI generated itself. Potentially owned by some corporation who didn't give permission to the person making the pull request to MIT license it.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to (1) I'm more worried about snippets of fresh code than e.g. suggested refactorings. I don't see how one can claim copyright over e.g. the use of `std::map` over `std::vector`.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to (2) in a way it's not a new risk. A contributor could already have a consultant standing next to them telling them what to write. It could then turn out the code belongs to that consultant (who didn't license it MIT) and not contributor (who at least implicitly did). But these AI companies have a lot more budget to actually legally harass the project over such claims.",
