   "body" : "This PR adds unit test coverage for the script compression functions `{Compress,Decompress}Script` in the special case of uncompressed P2PK outputs (scriptPubKey: OP_PUSH65 <0x04 ....> OP_CHECKSIG) with [pubkeys that are not fully valid](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/pubkey.cpp#L297-L302), i.e. where the encoded point is not on the secp256k1 curve. For those outputs, script compression is not possible, as the y coordinate of the pubkey can't be recovered (see also call-site of `IsToPubKey`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L49-L50\r\n\r\nLikewise, for a compressed script of an uncompressed P2PK script (i.e. compression ids 4 and 5) where the x coordinate is not on the curve, decompression fails:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L122-L129\r\n\r\nNote that the term \"compression\" is used here in two different meanings (though they are related), which might be a little confusing. The encoding of a pubkey can either be compressed (33-bytes with 0x02/0x03 prefixes) or uncompressed (65-bytes with 0x04 prefix). On the other hand there is also compression for whole output scripts, which is used for storing scriptPubKeys in the UTXO set in a compact way (and also for the `dumptxoutset` result, accordingly). P2PK output scripts with uncompressed pubkeys get compressed by storing only the x-coordinate and the sign as a prefix (0x04 = even, 0x05 = odd). Was diving deeper into the subject while working on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432, where the script decompression of uncompressed P2PK needed special handling (see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108798536).\r\n\r\nTrivia: as of now (block 801066), there are 13 uncompressed P2PK outputs in the UTXO set with a pubkey not on the curve (which obviously means they are unspendable).",
