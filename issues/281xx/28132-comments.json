When would full-rbf be \"by default\"?\r\n\r\nThis pull-req has nothing to do with Initial Block Download (IBD).\r\n\r\nIt simply changes the default for the `-mempoolfullrbf` option to true/enabled. Previously the default was false/disabled. Users who update Bitcoin Core to a version containing this change would by default propagate and mine full-rbf replacements unless they had chosen to disable full-rbf.\r\n\r\nA significant fraction of the P2P network has already chosen to enable full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements propagate reasonably well. Almost half of pools by hash power has enabled full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements that reach those miners are readily mined, as seen on https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf and https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/",

      "body" : "On the first line of arguments, I think zero-conf business acceptance have the option to deploy additional full-nodes with good transaction-relay peering to obtain a reasonable view of network mempools, and therefore increase their odds of seeing a double-spend of a confirmation of interest. In practice, zero-conf applications have risk threshold, once those thresholds are reached they will deactivate zero-conf acceptance.\r\n\r\nOn the second line or arguments, mempool consistency with miners is becoming a practical concern in my opinion with the appereance of so-called âtransaction acceleratorsâ, as now LSPs can use those out-of-band transaction-relay service to fee-bump their stuck multi-party transactions, and therefore provoke a divergence with the rest of the network. I raised this risk of [âmining income asymmetries due to unequal access in to transaction flows bypassing policiesâ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26438#issuecomment-1299522242) in Suhas proposal to remove the mempoolfullrbf option months ago.\r\n\r\nOn the third line of arguments about the enhancement of multi-party funded transactions flows, the original motivation is explained in this [post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html) on the lightning dev mailing list. RBF opt-out allows a counterparty contributing an input to block the confirmation of a multi-party transaction at minimal cost, therefore enabling a liquidity griefing at low-cost (size of the pinning tx * mempool min fee).\r\n\r\nSince then, early Lightning Service Providers deploying dual-funding have raised again the [concern](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html) on the mailing list during May of this year, and how sustained RBF signaling flag opt-out can be an annoying vector of pinning attack. While from my understanding the issue might be solved on the Lightning-side by upcoming deployment of nversion=3 (where full-rbf is implied by the policy regime), this wonât solve the pinning issue for coinjoin multi-party transactions which are concerned too (and this is not sure that weâre deploying nversion=3 for the dual-funding/splicing flows due to package limits size). With that context in mind, full-rbf by default is a welcome deployment for second-layers and multi-party applications.\r\n\r\nOn the deployment schedule, weâre still mid-26.0 schedule, so I think itâs reasonable to land it now (feature freeze scheduled for 2023-10-01 as of today July 24th). This still gives a period of roughly 5 months to zero-conf business and other software that would need to tweak their software.\r\n\r\n37% of the hash power sounds a reasonable demonstration of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem selecting the transaction-relay policy favoring maximization of their mining income strategy.\r\n\r\nSo Iâm Concept ACK on this change, I still think this change deserves announcement on the mailing list and usual technical communication channels to warn ecosystem stakeholders impacted by the proposed change.",

Max also at the time was open to do a call, I can check again now and see if this is still the case and connect you.\r\nThat on its own is enough of a sample to validate our statistics.\r\nI haveÂ also spokenÂ to Changelly earlier today and they offered to email pro @ changelly.com and they will be able to confirm GAP600 as a service provider. Also please send me the 1 trx hash you tested and I can see if it was queried to our system and if so offer some info as to why it wasnt approved. Also if you can elaborateÂ how you integrated with Changelly - I can check with them if that area is not integrated with GAP600.Â \r\nAs the architect of such a major change to the status of 0-conf transactionsÂ I would think you would welcome the opportunityÂ to speak to business and users who actual activities will be impacted by full RBF becoming dominant.\r\nAre you able to provide the same i.e emails and contacts of people at theÂ miningÂ pools who can confirm they have adopted FULL RBF ?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Reposting my reply to this identical message on the mailing list:\r\n> On Mon, Jul 31, 2023 at 03:13:19AM -0700, Daniel Lipshitz wrote: This would unnecessarily and extremely negatively impact merchants and users who choose to accept 0-conf while using mitigation tools like GAP600. This negative impact could be avoided by simply adding first seen safe rule - ie a trx can be replaced but needs to include the original outputs. At GAP600 we continue to see strong use of our service for BTC we have seen circa 350k unique trx hash per month (over the last 3 months) requested to our platform. Our clients include - Coinpayments, Coinspaid and Changelly.\r\n> I checked, and Coinpayments and Coinspaid are both merchant processors. I could not find any example of actual merchants using their platform accepting unconfirmed payments. I also could not find any documentation on their websites indicating unconfirmed transaction acceptance. As for Changelly, their website says right on the front that \"With an average transaction speed of 5â40 minutes, we ensure you can swiftly take advantage of market opportunities.\" Obivously, 5 minutes is not an unconfirmed payment. Additionally, I verified myself by doing test transactions with BIP125 disabled and an adequate fee: unconfirmed payments are not accepted by Changelly. As their exchange flow clearly says \"Once BTC is confirmed in the blockchain, weâll start exchanging it to <coin>.\" You need to provide an genuine example of an actual merchant who accepts unconfirmed transactions as payment, and actually relies on first-seen behavior.\r\n> We have not seen any impact of full RBF on double spend rates for our trxs\r\n> Based on the above findings, this appears to be because you don't actually have any clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.\r\n\r\n",
