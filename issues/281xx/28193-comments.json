      "body" : "nit: Looks like the approach employed is to pick a random X value until one is found that is not on the curve.  What is the rationale for using randomness, rather than choosing a fixed X value that is not on the curve (e.g. `fd0473a380ddf239accbc31770fcc6e64096930eaa8bc57c10f5868f3596fe1e`)?  Seems like the other tests in the test file use randomness as well (e.g. `GenerateRandomKey()`), so maybe I'm missing something.  Selecting a known invalid X value would technically increase test repeatability and consistency of test execution performance (although all of the 10 runs executed locally resulted in no more than a handful of X-picking attempts before finding an invalid X value, so performance is hardly a concern here).\r\n\r\nIf I'm not overlooking something, slightly less than half of the 32-byte space is valid X coordinates on the curve, so random selection would seem to have a negligible risk of starvation in finding an off-curve X value.\r\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/55196/is-there-a-point-on-the-secp256k1-curve-for-any-given-x-coordinate",
