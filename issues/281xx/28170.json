Allowing the node\r\nto recover from the following post-IBD scenario:\r\nSuppose the node has successfully synced the chain, but later experienced\r\ndropped connections and remained inactive for a duration longer than the limited\r\npeers threshold (the timeframe within which limited peers can provide blocks). In\r\nsuch cases, upon reconnecting to the network, the node might only establish\r\nconnections with limited peers, filling up all available outbound slots. Resulting\r\nin an inability to synchronize the chain (because limited peers will not provide\r\nblocks older than the `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_MIN_BLOCKS` threshold).",
