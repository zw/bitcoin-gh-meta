      "body" : "> It's probably much easier suggested than done, but did you attempt to implement parallelization in a more general way so that other indices could benefit from it as well?\r\n\r\nYeah, that is part of the plan. I started with the block filter index because it requires an special treatment that `txindex` parallelization does not require (block/undo data reading and block filters creation can be parallelized but writing must be done sequentially due the need to link filter headers to their predecessors to create the filters-chain on disk).\r\n\r\nMy idea was to start reviewing this one, so the process gets as clean as possible, and then move forward with the generalization step. It's usually more natural to abstract processes when the specific cases are well-defined.",
