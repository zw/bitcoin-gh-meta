I started with the block filter index because it requires an special treatment that `txindex` parallelization does not require (block/undo data reading and block filters creation can be parallelized but writing must be done sequentially due the need to link filter headers to their predecessors to create the filters-chain on disk).\r\n\r\nMy idea was to start reviewing this one, so the process gets as clean as possible, and then move forward with the generalization step. It's usually more natural to abstract processes when the specific cases are well-defined.",

      "body" : "PR updated, most of it implementation has changed.\r\n\r\nThe news are:\r\n1) Decreased ThreadSync `cs_main` lock contention.\r\n2) Removed `CBlockIndex` access from the child indexes internals.\r\n3) Implemented generic workers pool.\r\n4) Introduced a last header cache for the Block Filter index. Avoiding disk reads on every new processed block.\r\n5) Enabled parallel sync on the tx index.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nThe introduced workers pool spawned by the `-indexworkers` init arg is shared among all the enabled indexes that support parallel sync.\r\n\r\nThe implementation uses `std::any` mainly to simplify the patch-set, the base class template form of it requires a larger set of changes.\r\n\r\nSide note: in a first glance and without going too far over the coinstats index implementation, I would say that it could also be parallelized. But will leave it for a follow-up to not continue expanding the PR size.\r\n\r\nFuture (doesn't need to be included here, just mentioning so the path is clear):\r\nI'm working on decoupling the initial sync logic into a separate structure, so indexes subscribe to events instead of reading blocks from disk by themselves.",

I don't see any (obvious) thread locking happening in `CAutoFile`. Since I keep block files on a spinning disk (`-blocksdir`), I wonder if that potentially slows things down - compared to fetching one file in a single uninterrupted operation.\r\n\r\nSo far (block 200K) my spinning disk is making a ton of noise and CPU activity is negligible.",

The thread pool can be destructed once all indexes initial sync finish (once the index is synced, it starts receiving blocks through the validation signals and does not use the initial sync workers anymore). \r\nI'm currently tackling theCharlatan's feedback, and thinking about some improvements. Will add this change too on the next push.",
