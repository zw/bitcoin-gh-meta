The inbound connection logic already prioritizes connections from diverse networks (evicting connections from groups with many networks if a new incoming connection appears from a different one).\r\n\r\nStill, it doesn't seem unreasonable to have a way to just ban for just inbound connections, but I feel like that applies equally to other IP ranges, so perhaps it is better to add that as an orthogonal feature to banman?",
