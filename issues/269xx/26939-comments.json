The context there also indicates that outside of advising that you symlink old .dat block files to the smb drive (via custom script) there is not much that we can do about it in Core due to levelDB limitations.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd re-iterate what was said in that thread: you really don't want your chainstate database (`$DATADIR/chainstate`) or block index (`$DATADIR/blocks/index`) on a slow networked disk as fast access is needed for these, but raw block (`blk*.dat`) and maybe their undo files (`rev*.dat`), which comprise the bulk of a node's storage requriements, are probably ok on a networked drive.",
