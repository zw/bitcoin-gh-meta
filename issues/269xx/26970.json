   "body" : "In the functional test wallet_groups.py we whitelist peers on all nodes (`-whitelist=noban@127.0.0.1`) to enable immediate tx relay for fast mempool synchronization. However, considering that this setting only applies to inbound peers and the default test topology looks like this:\r\n```\r\n    node0 <--- node1 <---- node2 <--- ... <-- nodeN\r\n```\r\n\r\ntxs propagate fast only from lower- to higher-numbered nodes (i.e. \"left to right\" in the above diagram) and take long from higher- to lower-numbered nodes (\"right to left\") since in the latter direction we only have outbound peers, where the trickle relay is still active. As a consequence, if a tx is submitted from any node other than node0, the mempool synchronization can take quite long.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by simply adding another connection from node0 to the last node, leading to a ~2-3x speedup (5 runs measured via `time ./test/functional/wallet_groups.py` are shown):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster:\r\n    0m53.31s real     0m08.22s user     0m05.60s system\r\n    0m32.85s real     0m07.44s user     0m04.08s system\r\n    0m46.40s real     0m09.18s user     0m04.23s system\r\n    0m46.96s real     0m11.10s user     0m05.74s system\r\n    0m57.23s real     0m10.53s user     0m05.59s system\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n    0m19.64s real     0m09.58s user     0m05.50s system\r\n    0m18.05s real     0m07.77s user     0m04.03s system\r\n    0m18.99s real     0m07.90s user     0m04.25s system\r\n    0m17.49s real     0m07.56s user     0m03.92s system\r\n    0m18.11s real     0m07.74s user     0m03.88s system\r\n```\r\nNote that in most tests this is not a problem since txs very often originate from node0.\r\n",
