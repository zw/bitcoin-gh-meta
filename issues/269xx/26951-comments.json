There's a few issues (at least one of which is my fault).\r\n\r\nThe BlockFilter and BlockFilterIndex interfaces assume that the GCSFilter::Params can be generated just from the filter type and the block_hash.  I previously tried changing these interfaces so that they didn't make this assumption, but I found that to involve a lot of changes that were frankly just confusing.\r\n\r\nThe BlockFilter serialization matches the BIP157/158 serialization, but isn't the serialization that I want for the wallet rescan index.  Specifically the index ends up writing the block_hash twice and the filter_type to the flat file, both of which are implied when looking up the filter in the first place. (They waste disk space and decode time).\r\n\r\nLastly the BlockFilterIndex appends a sha256 hash to the end to check for disk corruption, this would be a significant cost (indeed the siphash that I'm using now is 10% of the total runtime, I'm going to replace it with a crc32c).",
