      "body" : "The `No rpcpassword set - using random cookie authentication` line is a little misleading, because even though bitcoind is generating a cookie file, it should still be picking up and using your `rpcauth=` option.\r\n\r\nWhile `-rpcpassword` and cookie auth are mutually exclusive, `-rpcauth` and cookie auth are not, and `-rpcpassword` and `-rpcauth` are also not exclusive. This is pretty confusing, but might be clearer if the `-rpcpassword` server option is ever removed.\r\n\r\nSo it's unclear what your problem could be. You might want to search for `Using config file` in your debug.log to make sure your configured `rpcauth=` value is being picked up. And when you are passing `-rpcauth=` on the command line, you should make sure the dollar sign in the middle of the string is properly escaped, because the shell might be stripping it out, and bitcoin doesn't print any diagnostic if the dollar sign is missing. You can escape rpcauth in a unix shell either by wrapping it in single quotes `'-rpcauth=...'` or by putting a backslash before dollar sign `\\$`.",

I know my node is reading from the config file as other changes in the config file are reflected in my node, such as switching from cookie authentication to rpcuser authentication. I couldn't find anything in my logs mentioning rpcauth but I will double check and see when I can get back to my node. I will try running some more tests with bitcoin-cli and the rpcauth authentication (outside of the Lightning node) as well and get back to you.",
