   "body" : "Recently I was discussing how to lock down access on a Bitcoin node with @jlin816 and we came up with 2 features that would be useful.\r\n\r\nProposing 2 features:\r\n\r\n1. rpc.conf file, which contains a list of enabled RPCs. No other RPCs should be callable. rpc.conf should be loaded at startup. The default file is all of them. Can also be passed in as command line args perhaps.\r\n1. a compile time flag file whitelist. The default file is all of them. This eases the production of custom builds where it would be impossible for the RPC to be called even if rpc.conf is not correctly set.\r\n\r\nIt's not high priority, but having this would make it easier to produce bitcoin node binaries for high security environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or reservations on the above design before @jlin816 takes a crack at it (for her first contribution). Is this functionality already possible without external proxy?",
