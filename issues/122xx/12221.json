Directory can contain more than one wallet so plural makes sense\r\n3. This makes it harder to confuse `-walletdir` option with `-wallet` option if we store wallets in their own directories as proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11466#issuecomment-335827526 and implemented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12216",
