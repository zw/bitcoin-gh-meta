So, as a work around, I ended up setting up a rpcuser and rpcpassword. Looking at my debug.log, I saw the line saying that those options have been superseded by rpcauth since 2015. I looked up how to do this and found and downloaded the rpcuser.py script and ran it and I got a line to put into my config file. It looked like this.\r\n\r\n`rpcauth=linrono:8512a641e39573384c5c321d5d1527a$ab5536ee2244c70ad2efe8d68bd50e3495a7a48656794a094f5b1a2a5a874a4d`\r\n\r\nThis is not what I am using, but what I have was generated the same way. After saving this to my config file and restarting my client, I checked my debug log file and found this line. \r\n\r\n`No rpcpassword set - using random cookie authentication`\r\n\r\nI double checked and there was, indeed, a cookie file generated. \r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\nI thought the rpcauth was replacing the rpcuser and rpcpassword authentication.\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nNo matter what I do, I cannot seem to get the node to accept the rpcauth line in my config file. I did try to run the client with the rpcauth as a command line option. This also did not work.\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nI am using the v0.15.1.0-g7b57bc998f33 client. It is the most up to date version provided by the ArchLinux repositories.\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nI am running ArchLinux and am using a Corei7.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if this is a known issue or I'm doing something wrong. I did try to search for more information and found comments on this bitcoin Stack Exchange question with the same issue but no resolution. \r\n\r\n`https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/46782/rpc-cookie-authentication`\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
