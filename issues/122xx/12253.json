I believe that's a shortcoming we should address before release.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be for P2WPKH (P2SH and native) to be supported without any extra arguments. This means that a P2WPKH address/script with corresponding private or public key should work. For P2SH it means checking if the supplied P2SH address perhaps matches the supplied public key or private key when converted to P2WPKH first.\r\n\r\nTo support P2WSH, I think we need an extra field \"witnessScript\". When supplied, it would either be required to match a P2WSH address/script directly, or if the address is P2SH, indirectly.",
