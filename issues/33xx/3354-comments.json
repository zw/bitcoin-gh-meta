Of course, that leads to the next step of \"why don't we just provide the signature and prove two signatures were signed for the same scriptPubKey\" which then makes address re-use of any kind ever rather problematic, to say the least. Conveniently SHA256 midstates are no use here either, as the important bits - the COutPoints - are at the very start of a transaction.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, if you're ever in a situation where transactions have to be re-issued false positives are a problem, e.g. bumping fees because your transaction won't mine and expired out of the mempool. Or for that matter if you ever participate in a ANYONECANPAY crowd-fund thing that fails. And then of course there's CoinJoin...\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell Another good one is how do you handle floating fees? Do you relay the double-spend even though you wouldn't relay the transaction? Because if you don't, then it acts like a IsStandard() rule split and you can do things like relay a particularly low-fee tx first, let it propagate so some of the network, then relay the high-fee version and let it propagate to your target. Of course, then there's the issue that every time we change IsStandard() the double-spend relay stops working reliably. (to the extent it ever worked at all) It interacts badly with out-of-band miner payments too: suppose I have a zero-fee tx and get some miner OOB to mine it. The rest of the network won't see my tx, which lets me broadcast the fee-paying version. Meanwhile even if the miner is \"honest\" the best they can do is tell their peers about the double-spend, and those peers will just ignore it because it has no fee attached and they wouldn't accept it to their mempool.",
