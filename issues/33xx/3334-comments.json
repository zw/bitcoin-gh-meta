Perhaps it is to others.\r\n\r\nI was already sending out somewhere in the vicinity of 6-8TB a month just from people downloading the blockchain... I dare say I wouldn't want to contribute to that bloat by allowing all these low fee transactions.\r\n\r\nre: Increasing \"full nodes\".  Most full nodes aren't very useful, since they have very limited upstream.  Maybe you can convince some people to buy some kimsufis when they're available again.  After all, any 'full node' that isn't related to a pool is a charity, I've wasted roughly $500 or so",

This could be made transparent to the user by shipping a daemon (I think armory already does this) that runs optionally in the background. \r\n\r\nThis would be pretty straightforward to do, in comparison with hacking the current wallet code.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion of the future of the GUI of Bitcoin-Qt is as a GUI for power users and developers. Primarily a full node with a neat RPC console and statistics, and optional (albeit limited compared to other projects) wallet. There are some nice user friendly wallet projects out there and I don't see the point of competing with them for beginning users.\r\n",
