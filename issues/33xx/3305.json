The new fee after this patch is 0.5 cents.\r\n\r\nMiners who prefer the higher fees are obviously still able to\r\nuse the command line flags to override this setting. Miners who\r\nchoose to create smaller blocks will select the highest-fee paying\r\ntransactions anyway.\r\n\r\nThis would hopefully be the last manual adjustment ever required\r\nbefore floating fees become normal.",
