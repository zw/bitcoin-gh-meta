Hell, we barely consider that for backporting things for our own older releases. In fact, in the past, we have done large breaking refactors specifically right after the branching of a release even though doing so makes it explicitly harder to make backports.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes a whole lot of sense for us to try to maintain compatibility with upstream UniValue. It doesn't appear to be maintained at all, and we have had it as a subtree for years already.",

If we decide to support forked repos that want to support system univalue it should be done properly with something like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25153#issuecomment-1132618613 . If we decide against that, then it shouldn't be reverted obviously.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't care if 25153 is reverted or not, but I think this whole discussion might be a bit exaggerated. 25153 is a scripted-diff that will run in a few milliseconds. It should take less than 2 minutes for any forked repos to write an inverse scripted-diff which can be executed in the same few milliseconds on any branch they wish to execute it on.",
