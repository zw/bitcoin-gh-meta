   "body" : "This changes `AssertLockNotHeld` so that it is annotated with the negative capability for the mutex it refers to. clang applies negative capabilities recursively, so this helps avoid forgetting to annotate functions.\r\n\r\nNote that this can't reasonably be used for globals, because clang would require every function to be annotated with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!g_mutex)` for each global mutex. At present, the only global mutexes that use `AssertLockNotHeld` are `RecursiveMutex` so we treat that as an exception in order to avoid having to add an excessive number of negative annotations.",
