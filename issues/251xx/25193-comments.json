I think it's unnecessarily fragile how the value starts off false, then switches to true, then switches back to false again, and think a one way latch would be better. I think it's bad the the variable doesn't have any straightforward meaning but is some combination \"was reindexing requested?\" and \"is reindexing in progress?\". Also in this commit, `fReindexChainState` is different local variables subtly replaced by a global so you can't tell just looking at a diff whether all the existing `fReindexChainState` references were updated correctly.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest leaving `fReindexChainState` alone, and adding a simpler `atomic_bool g_indexes_ready_to_sync = false` global variable, and setting it to true here, and in the normal code path. I think this would make the diff and the overall initialization sequence simpler and easier to understand.",

This way, the pruning check will continue to be executed regardless of pruning status (unless -reindex is specified).\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like is that this would throw a confusing InitError message if it somehow failed on a non-pruning node (\"block of the index goes beyond pruned data\").

The [`FindForkInGlobalIndex`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2111f32f2a6998531871e7792b5208992868ba7f/src/validation.cpp#L131-L149) behavior is much different than the [`FindFork`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2111f32f2a6998531871e7792b5208992868ba7f/src/chain.cpp#L54-L63) behavior. I assumed `FindForkInGlobalIndex` would try to find the last common ancestor between the locator block and the chain like `FindFork` does, but it doesn't even try to do this. Instead it will literally only return the exact locator block, or the chain tip, or the genesis block. It doesn't make any sense to me why the function would be implemented this way, but I guess it's good that this PR removes one usage of it...",
