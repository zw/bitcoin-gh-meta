Maybe rawtoaddress and rawmany\r\n\r\nThey both have problems and would need major refactoring.  sendmany, for example, kicks off a chain of function calls with nearly all of the work happening at or near the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy (but ugly) to add a flag to most of the calls, and a reference for letting the raw transaction percolate back up.\r\n\r\nA better solution, in my opinion, would be to refactor those calls.  sendtoaddress would first call a stack that returns an unsigned transaction, then call a second stack that signs it and commits (wallet, memporypool, relay, etc).  The raw version would instead return the hex to the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nhttp://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2013/12/13#l1386951924",
