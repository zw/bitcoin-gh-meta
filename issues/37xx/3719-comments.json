But thats hideously complicated to implement. After headers-first it may be possible to implement advantage-over-next-best-chain without the doesn't-include constraint without much work. I dunno, the whole subject of risk analysis is a horrible rat-hole and I'm afraid solid advice will have poor patient-concordance.\r\n\r\nAttacks are rare and the cost of being immune to attacks hits you with every transaction.

      "body" : "Hi all. You've got me a little worried with all of this - I'm building a merchant terminal which is going to be used mainly for small transactions (few dollars max, like coffees etc.) Are you saying I can't let my customers walk out of the door for 10-60 minutes after purchasing? Or is it still safe to accept 0-conf transactions for small amounts? If so, what checking do I need to implement to rule out obvious double-spends and other cheats? Any links to detailed discussions would be very welcome.",

      "body" : "@NanoAkron coffee is not generally representative of all uses of Bitcoin. Do your merchants also wait months for credit card transactions to settle?  Do they pay telechex fees to accept checks? Do they even obtain signatures on their credit card transactions?\r\n\r\nYou cannot rule out double-spends if you are accepting transactions without confirmation. Beyond making sure that you've heard the transaction from a full node you either operate or trust implicitly there isn't really a ton of checking that can be done.\r\n\r\nFor small amounts the risk is probably acceptableÃ¢ÂÂ and if its concerning getting ID makes sure you can blacklist the customer. But that isn't the same as saying that there is no risk by any means.",
