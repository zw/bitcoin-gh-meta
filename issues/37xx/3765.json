This shouldn't happen, but it can and does sometimes, so this code caters for that.\r\n\r\nThis code also becomes more important as the block download algorithm is changed in future,\r\nsuch as concurrent block downloads from multiple peers, and retries are sent to other peers\r\nwhen peers seem unresponsive, only to become responsive again later, by which time\r\nthey are sending duplicate blocks.\r\n\r\nThis was pull requested previously, but NACKed with the argument that we shouldn't punish peers for doing what was asked of them. However, although we may fix that in future, I still maintain this is for the overall health of the network, and may become redundant in future as the block download algorithm improves. Even if the algorithm is later improved, it would still be beneficial to have this code, although perhaps instead of simply disconnecting the nodes, it would be better to mark them as misbehaving (e.g. if they send blocks which were never requested).",
