You could also decide to replace an old transaction in the superblock if a new transaction has the same inputs, but higher priority. At first glance, this will mitigate the problem of transactions getting stuck in the mempool.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would also be a really good way to have dynamic fees, as planned, work even better.",

One danger is that the relaying/mempool rules are no longer predictable, and will very per node as well as over time. But on the other hand I think that's unavoidable. Even currently there are differences between nodes due to the version. \r\n\r\nIt means that clients have to adapt and cope with non-relaying and non-confirming transactions better.\r\n",
