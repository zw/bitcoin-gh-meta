You already need regular backups of non-HD wallets anyway, needing a one-time new backup after migration to HD doesn't seem too big of a deal to me. As said above, I do prefer a few more years before forcing people to migrate, but if one accepts that a migration is going to happen, I don't see the problem with restricting it to use HD key derivation. If one is concerned about the specifics of BIP32's unhardened derivation, it should be possible to choose hardened derivation descriptors instead, or by then some other deterministic key derivation mechanism may be supported by descriptors.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "#26596 (draft) allows users to migrate a legacy wallet without the need for BDB. There are some (corruption) scenario's it can't handle. For that users would have to download an old version of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nRecent versions contain a separate `bitcoin-wallet` binary, which means they don't have to run a potentially outdated Bitcoin Core node just to migrate their wallet. We'd have to make sure that standalone tool is feature complete enough. I don't have much experience with fixing corrupt wallets. See #13044 for things that might be missing (e.g. only available as an bitcoind RPC call or startup argument).\r\n\r\nIn addition we'd need a way to migrate a non-hd legacy wallet (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20160#issuecomment-1244759508). IIUC in particular we need it to _not_ generate a fresh HD seed in that case. And maybe benchmark the performance to see if the use of individual SKPM's is acceptable, and if not, design a new one that can have multiple keys. Such ancient wallets may be a very small number of users, but probably not very small amounts of BTC. It makes sense to make any migration for them as limited as possible (they can create a fresh wallet and move coins over when they feel comfortable). In particular this deprecation should not be a barrier to upgrade their node.\r\n\r\nHaving a read-only BDB wallet (which #26596 enables) could be useful for such users too. It lets them see the coins are still there.\r\n\r\nThat removes any objections I have about dropping BDB from the codebase and dependencies entirely. However, not too soon. We can probably wait until the ancient 2010 code becomes a problem for (using) modern compilers. As long as building from source and running (most of) the test suite doesn't require BDB, it's not a huge burden to keep it around a while longer.",
