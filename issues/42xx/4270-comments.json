      "body" : "I've managed to reproduce @gavinandresen 's gitian build by adding the `libqt4-dev` package to the `gitian-linux.yml`. Seemingly the gitian linux build picks the globally installed qt4 headers  (Qt 4.8.x) before the locally compiled ones (4.6.x).\r\n\r\nThis sucks a lot because we make it compile against the Qt 4.6.x headers to be compatible with older linux distros, and they get ignored here.\r\n\r\nWe define both\r\n- ` --with-qt-bindir=$STAGING/bin`\r\n- `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"$STAGING/lib/pkgconfig\"`\r\n\r\nIn theory this should be enough to make it pick our headers.\r\n\r\n@theuni any idea how to force the build to use *our* Qt headers even harder?\r\n",
