This PR fixes both.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing a specific output using the index given in the tx, check that it is actually a possible output before trying to access the output.\r\n\r\nWhen summing and checking amounts for `decodepsbt` and `analyzepsbt`, make sure that the values are actually valid money values.. Otherwise, stop summing and don't show the fee. For `analyzepsbt`, return that the next role is the Creator since the Creator needs to remake the transaction to be valid.",
