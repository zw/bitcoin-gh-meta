   "body" : "Even if a test chain doesn't MineBlocksOnDemand (aka consensus.fPowNoRetargeting = false), it may make sense to allow the rpc call setmocktime for that chain.\r\n\r\nFor example, it could be allowed by default for testnet3 (aka \"test\" on bip70).\r\nOr at least this is what I think @MarcoFalke wants from our last conversation on IRC.\r\nFor more context see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16770#issuecomment-537711517\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, unlike consensus.fPowNoRetargeting, the new field m_allow_set_mocktime gets fully out of consensus code in the sense that people \"greping\" from consensus/params.h don't need to necessarily look at rpc call setmocktime in rpc/misc.cpp if that's not what they're looking for.\r\nOne less read to Consensus::Params.\r\nNot sure if that last part makes sense to anyone else but me as reasons to get this merged. \r\n\r\n",
