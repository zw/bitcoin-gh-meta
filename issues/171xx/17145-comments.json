Would it not be best to just jump straight to developing with QML and fixing the blocking issues there? \r\n\r\nquestion2 is regarding the [Process-Separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Process-Separation), separating out QT from the core into its own process and communicated via IPC, really fundamentally changes the look feel responsiveness and overall proper design of the QT/GUI. if this process separation is something that we are committed to doing, maybe best to start there? and maybe even merge the two efforts into 1? separate the GUI into new QML in a new process? \r\n\r\nas a side note, from my experience trying it both ways, ( my previous project started as a separate process, [communicating via ipc to QT-Widgets](https://github.com/protoblock/fantasybit-2014/tree/windows/cute-fantasy), and a [single process with QML](https://github.com/protoblock/protoblock/tree/master/src/gui/qml)) , the single process was the way to go. in fact we started with ipc/widgets and refactored to single process/qml. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
