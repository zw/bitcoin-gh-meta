I see logic errors and asserts as semantically equivalent, both indicating the presence of bugs, but logic_errors working better with unit tests. I think the suggested macro could be a good idea, because `if (cond) throw std::logic_error(strprintf(...))` is pretty verbose, and I think that discourages use. (Grepping for logic_error` I think every existing logic_error throw actually comes from me and no one other bitcoin developer has written one.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think it would be a good idea to ever catch `std::logic_error` outside of unit tests. I think that defeats the major advantage of logic_errors as logical assertions compatible with having good test coverage.\r\n\r\nIf the goal here is better isolation from nonfatal bugs in RPCs, I think I'd suggest instead defining a new `NonfatalError` class inheriting from `std::exception`, a `CHECK_NONFATAL` or similar macro throwing nonfatal error exceptions, and code to catch and handle those exceptions somewhere in the RPC framework.",

If I found a bug and don't want the program to crash, I would use a different exception like `std::runtime_error` or a custom exception like the suggested `CHECK_NONFATAL` / `NonFatalCheckError`. Again, I think the nice thing about `logic_error` is that it can provide the same semantics as `assert` without getting in the way of unit test coverage. If we start catching `logic_error` exceptions then it loses those advantages because I no longer know what to expect when I throw it.\r\n\r\n> We already do that right now.\r\n\r\nlogic_error doesn't inherit from runtime_error, so I hope this isn't the case\r\n\r\n> There shouldn't be any fatal error in rpc code that would warrant a crash\r\n\r\nThis is subjective and is something reasonable people can disagree about. But I think it would be best for authors who add checks to clearly distinguish cases where they do and don't want crashes by using `assert` or `logic_error` in fatal cases, and `CHECK_NONFATAL` or `std::runtime_error` or similar in nonfatal cases.\r\n\r\nI'm fully onboard with your original suggestion to get rid of asserts in RPC code. All I'm suggesting is that instead of replacing them with `logic_error` throws, you replace them with something like `NonFatalCheckError` throws. You already proposed defining a custom `THROW_LOGIC_ERROR_IF_ASSERT_FAILS` macro, so I don't see what objection you would have to a shorter, clearer `CHECK_NONFATAL` macro instead.",
