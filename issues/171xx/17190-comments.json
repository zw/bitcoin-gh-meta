Specifically for Electrum's current HD wallets it would be a `m/0/i` (receive), `m/1/j` (change) hierarchy. To do this you however currently need two `KEY` expressions.\r\nI think basically all light wallets use this hierarchy atm (m/0/i, m/1/j), this is also what BIP44 uses.\r\n\r\nAs detailed in first link above, currently in Electrum when constructing a multisig wallet, cosigners share xpubs with each other; other contextual information such as number of required signers are selected in the GUI. To be able to construct an output script descriptor that describes a multisig where cosigners have key origin information for example, instead of xpubs, we could show `KEY` expressions to cosigners that they would share each other. The issue is HOW the cosigners are supposed to create the script descriptor.\r\n\r\nFor now, we would want to support at least the above described receive/change hierarchy, but with the current `KEY` expression syntax cosigners would need to be shown and then expected to share two of these. \r\n\r\nI know there are some undesirable properties of sharing these instead of the xpubs as now not the whole thing is checksummed, but the script descriptor needs to be constructed **somehow**. When looking at the output descriptors doc, I feel like this point has been considered completely out of scope so far, but it is a real UX issue.",

If these decisions aren't tracked well, this \"contextual information\" becomes hidden state which frustrates users and developers alike.\r\n\r\nDescriptors are *almost* the perfect way to encode these decisions into a concise, robust, portable format.  The ability to specify multiple \"families\" of addresses for (say) receiving vs. change addresses would be extremely useful.\r\n\r\nOne can argue that multiple descriptors are just as good but practically they lack a shared checksum and aesthetically using to almost identical long strings to represent two related families seems wrong.  Related descriptors are extremely similar and differ merely in one derivation path segment.  It would be more natural for the descriptor definition to allow multiple wildcards `.../*/*` or constructs such as `.../{0,1}/*` to enable this use case.",

Change and receive addresses (scripts) are simply assumed to be at ./1/* and ./0/*, as derived from the xpubs given in the multisig descriptor.\r\n\r\nWe also register the multisig setup in the device. Having one descriptor correspond to one multisig account makes things easier than to register multiple descriptors (one for receive, one for change), as the user has to verify less data. Backup is also simplified - one descriptor is easier to backup and restore than two.\r\n\r\nSince pretty much every wallet deals with changes and receive addresses in this way, I don't see it as very useful track two separate descriptors, or even to put two separate derivation paths into one descriptor. Sounds easiest to stick to the convention of ./1/* and ./0/* for change and receive addresses.",

      "body" : "Another question that was posed to me recently was why do we even have split derivation paths in the first place? It seems to me that there isn't really an advantage to having receiving and change addresses be separated. If anything, it is creating more of a problem because it makes backups harder. Unless there is a strong reason to continue to use separate receiving and change descriptors, I think the entire ecosystem should move away from this separation. That would make this entire issue moot.\r\n\r\nFrom reading BIP 32, it seems like the primary reason for recommending split key chains is to allow for an xpub to be given out to people (for some reason) but still maintain some privacy about funds that were sent to change. I don't think xpubs are shared publicly, and there are known issues with unhardened derivation, so I don't think this is a valid use case anymore.",

So something like\r\n\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../{0-10}/{0-1}/*\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../1/0/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../1/1/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../2/0/*)\r\n    wpkh(xpub.../2/1/*)\r\n    ... etc.\r\n\r\nBut if there are multiple keys, such as in multisigs, it gets a bit more complicated. For example\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../{0-1}/*, xpub.../{0-1}/*)\r\n\r\nTo fit with the expectation of change and not change, this would become\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../0/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../1/*)\r\n\r\nrather than\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../0/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../1/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../0/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../1/*)\r\n\r\nBut maintaining this pattern for change and not change doesn't quite work if there are multiple of these multipath expressions as BIP 88 allows. For example, how would\r\n\r\n    multi(2,xpub.../48h/0h/{0,1}/*,xpub.../48h/{0-10}/{0,1})`\r\n\r\nbe expanded?\r\n\r\nSo I think perhaps this is not a tenable solution, or it may result in expansions that contain unexpected descriptors. I suppose one method is to just limit this syntax to single key descriptors, but then it isn't quite as useful, and I would prefer to have Key expressions which don't have special syntaxes that only work for certain descriptors.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nInstead of a generic solution like BIP 88, we could implement a specific solution for just the receive and change issue. Perhaps a special path index `{r,c}` that is allowed to appear once per path. `r` is the path to use for receiving addresses, and `c` is the path to use for change addresses. This works for descriptors with multiple keys as this would become two descriptors, one with only the `r` indexes, and one with only the `c` indexes. Since only one is allowed per path specifier, there is no issue with multiple path specifiers as BIP 88 would have. In the common case, it would still be written as `{0,1}`, but other derivation paths could be used for `r` and `c` if desired.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../{0,1}/*, xpub.../{2,3}/*)\r\n\r\nwould become\r\n\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../0/*, xpub.../2/*)\r\n    multi(2, xpub.../1/*, xpub.../3/*)",

So it's not like we're gaining extra functionality with this change.\r\n\r\nFrom my view, in its current form, multipath descriptors would add more complexity to make the UX feel nice/\"correct\", but is really putting makeup on some (weird?) underlying design decisions: why do we need this convention of derivation paths at `{xpub}/0/*` and `{xpub}/1/*` to differentiate between receiving and change (`internal`) addresses? Since pretty much every wallet deals with changes and receive addresses in this way, couldn't we just always consider even paths `range_index % 2 == 0` (ie `{xpub}/0/0`, `{xpub}/0/2`, ...) receiving,  and odd indexes (`{xpub}/0/1`, `{xpub}/0/3`, ...) change/`internal`?  I don't see how this imposes any limitations or additional complexity, and seems to fit better with the boolean nature of `internal == true/false`. At that point we have one **simple** descriptor, and I think this aligns more with what users would actually expect to see (why would they need to do anything extra to handle change? Even a multipath `<0;1>` in the descriptor is extra, and seems like unnecessary details for pretty much everyone but those working on the implementation of descriptor wallets).\r\n\r\nReading through the descriptor/wallet code, I don't understand why we need both:\r\n```c++\r\nstd::map<OutputType, ScriptPubKeyMan*> m_external_spk_managers;\r\nstd::map<OutputType, ScriptPubKeyMan*> m_internal_spk_managers;\r\n```\r\nThe differentiation between the two doesn't make much sense to me, as it seems to just come down to \"when we receive to this address do we show it as an incoming transaction, or is this just change from a send we did?\" So I'm also wondering if there's an opportunity to simplify/refactor code instead of make it more complicated.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how entrenched these conventions are, or maybe I'm missing some implementation details that make my idea impractical.

The name of the game is flexibility.\r\n\r\n> From my view, in its current form, multipath descriptors would add more complexity to make the UX feel nice/\"correct\", but is really putting makeup on some (weird?) underlying design decisions: why do we need this convention of derivation paths at `{xpub}/0/*` and `{xpub}/1/*` to differentiate between receiving and change (`internal`) addresses? Since pretty much every wallet deals with changes and receive addresses in this way, couldn't we just always consider even paths `range_index % 2 == 0` (ie `{xpub}/0/0`, `{xpub}/0/2`, ...) receiving, and odd indexes (`{xpub}/0/1`, `{xpub}/0/3`, ...) change/`internal`? I don't see how this imposes any limitations or additional complexity, and seems to fit better with the boolean nature of `internal == true/false`.\r\n\r\nThat is a possible solution, but it really limits flexibility. It would make it more difficult to have a completely different descriptor for change as well as a different derivation path. Again, this is not a problem for the automatically generated descriptor but rather if a user were to import something non-standard.\r\n\r\n> Reading through the descriptor/wallet code, I don't understand why we need both:\r\n> \r\n> ```c++\r\n> std::map<OutputType, ScriptPubKeyMan*> m_external_spk_managers;\r\n> std::map<OutputType, ScriptPubKeyMan*> m_internal_spk_managers;\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The differentiation between the two doesn't make much sense to me, as it seems to just come down to \"when we receive to this address do we show it as an incoming transaction, or is this just change from a send we did?\" So I'm also wondering if there's an opportunity to simplify/refactor code instead of make it more complicated.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this particular split is to be able to retrieve receiving and change addresses for the correct type. It facilitates having completely unrelated and wildly different descriptors for receiving and change. The user is not locked into a particular pattern if they don't want to be.\r\n\r\n> Reading through the discussion here, @benma seemed to have somewhat similar thoughts as me, and took an approach that wouldn't require any changes to core (although my idea would involve a deprecation process and refactor):\r\n> \r\n> > Since pretty much every wallet deals with changes and receive addresses in this way, I don't see it as very useful track two separate descriptors, or even to put two separate derivation paths into one descriptor. Sounds easiest to stick to the convention of ./1/* and ./0/* for change and receive addresses.\r\n\r\nI don't like this particular idea because it is an implicit conversion which goes against the entire ethos of descriptors - everything is explicitly stated. Furthermore, such an implicit conversion assumes that derivation paths follow a particular pattern and it will tend to break down when someone does something different.",

      "body" : "Thanks for the explanation, makes sense and gets me close to a Concept/Approach ack. One last thought, hopefully this either crosses the idea out or lets me know if it's worth looking into more:\r\n\r\nIf we were to implement the \"rule\":\r\n- even derivation paths `range_index % 2 == 0` (ie `{xpub}/*/0`, `{xpub}/*/2`, ...) are **always** receiving\r\n- odd paths (ie `{xpub}/*/1`, `{xpub}/*/3`, ...) are **always** change/internal\r\n\r\nI would think there's a way to do this that doesn't limit flexibility or have significant downsides. Let's say we add an RPC option: `include_change`\r\n\r\nThen, going with the multisig example from #22067:\r\n```python\r\nmultisig = node.get_wallet_rpc(f\"{self.name}_{i}\")\r\nexternal = multisig.getdescriptorinfo(f\"wsh(sortedmulti({self.M},{f'/0/*,'.join(xpubs)}/0/*))\")\r\ninternal = multisig.getdescriptorinfo(f\"wsh(sortedmulti({self.M},{f'/1/*,'.join(xpubs)}/1m/*))\").  # hardened\r\nresult = multisig.importdescriptors([\r\n  {  # receiving addresses (internal: False)\r\n      \"desc\": external[\"descriptor\"],\r\n      \"internal\": False,\r\n      \"include_change\": False,\r\n  }\r\n  { # change addresses (internal: True)\r\n      \"desc\": internal[\"descriptor\"],\r\n      \"internal\": True,\r\n      \"include_change\": False,\r\n   },\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this shows that since `include_change` is `False` we can still accomplish this with two descriptors, same as before. This highlights that it's still simple to have a completely different descriptor for change as well as a different derivation path.\r\n\r\nBut, we could also now do:\r\n```python\r\nmultisig = node.get_wallet_rpc(f\"{self.name}_{i}\")\r\ndescriptor = multisig.getdescriptorinfo(f\"wsh(sortedmulti({self.M},{f'/0/*,'.join(xpubs)}/0/*))\")\r\nresult = multisig.importdescriptors([\r\n  {  # both change and receiving addresses\r\n      \"desc\": descriptor[\"descriptor\"],\r\n      \"include_change\": True,  # maybe this defaults to `True` to make it even more intuitive for the average user?\r\n  },\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems this is a win in terms of UX (even when compared to multipath descriptors in many cases). And may allow us to simplify some of the wallet / signer / descriptor code. It also may be a solid convention in general to build on for the wallet ecosystem?\r\n\r\nImportant to note, that even when `include_change` is `False`, receiving addresses will only ever use even paths and change/internal will only use odd paths. So the derivation paths actually used in the `range` is only ever half utilized as (even/odd paths are skipped over depending on receiving/change). But I don't see a practical reason that would be a problem.\r\n\r\nEither way I'll definitely be finishing my review of #22838 and have some ideas how I want to test it. But it's a pretty heavy change so I want to push back and make it's the best way forward",

      "body" : "I tend to agree with @craigraw that receive/change is a common and old enough pattern to warrant a special case. And having paper backups of the full string is useful, and a big reason why we bothered with a checksum in the first place. This could be done implicitly though, by only communicating the receive descriptor. But it seems much safer to slightly complicate the descriptor standard to add support for `n` derivation paths.\r\n\r\nThe `<NUM;NUM>` format used in #22838, or the `{NUM,NUM}` format above, can trivially be expanded to arbitrary length later. If constraining it to 2 items for now makes implementations easier, that's fine by me.\r\n\r\nOne thing to consider is the question of whether we should leave unused characters alone for future use. Any descriptor parser already needs to be significantly smarter than just looking for the presence of a specific character, so it probably doesn't matter what we pick here. That said, I don't find the argument for the current choice in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22838#issuecomment-930374136 particularly strong. And it seems several wallets have already jumped the gun on `<NUM;NUM>`.\r\n\r\nAs for multiple accounts: I think it's OK for users and wallet software to treat those as separate wallets. You probably wouldn't want to import multiple accounts into a single Bitcoin Core wallet, since it won't segregate the funds. So I can live with not having a nested version of this. But again it seems possible to add that later, without making the syntax too atrocious. That may actually be an argument in favor of `< ;` over `{ ,`, since it won't be ambiguous with `multi()`.",

BIP88 doesn't seem to cover that.\r\n\r\nA descriptor like this could be imported into watch-only wallets and other tools, solving the same problems listed throughout this issue that exist for the receive/change chains. \r\n\r\nMaybe a new top-level descriptor function could work for this, like `combined(wpkh(...),tr(...))`. The existing `combo()` function doesn't fit the bill as it covers too much (e.g. legacy P2PK) and too little (no P2TR?) and its specification can change over time, while descriptors should remain static.",
