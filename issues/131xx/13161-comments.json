Adding more initialization steps and  resetting fDbEnvInit and fMockDb members would seem to make the retry code a little more convoluted than it needs to be. It also doesn't seem good that the `close` return value isn't checked and nothing is logged if it failed (also true before this PR).\r\n\r\nI also wonder if we could add a unit test or functional test to exercise this code. One way could be to create a dummy `pathIn / \"database\"` file and checking to make sure it gets renamed to `database.{time}.bak` and the wallet still gets loaded successfully.",
