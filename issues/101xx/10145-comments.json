I agree that having preconditions closer to the code can be good; but it's also good to have a non-exposed function which only takes sanitized inputs, and do the sanitizing elsewhere. I agree with the state machine comment, but that was the existing state of the code: there is currently an implicit state machine on what order messages were allowed to come in. This PR makes it more explicit; if you want to make it even more explicit (e.g., ProtocolStateMachine class I think that would be great :)). This at least makes it really easy to do whatever you want with the actual dispatch as it is state independent.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's more maintainable to have repeated preconditions throughout the code, because then it is easier to forget to check a precondition in a handler and you repeat precondition checking code, leading to more opportunity for error. It's a trade off.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to re-check these preconditions if critical, which would maybe be \"the best/worst\" of both worlds.",

Different concerns (e.g. initial negotiation, handling pings, handling transactions, handling blocks, handling filters) could be separate state machines that handle groups of messages (this was @sipa's idea). Creating a separate handler class for every message type would be typical OOP overkill, but for separate concerns I think it'd make sense and would help untangle the current labyrinth.",

      "body" : "I only looked fast at the changes and read the rest of the comments, but this does way more than #9608 , even if #9608 would rebase on top of https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/f1e4e281e3f1eb884f8010ac941c82752174bdbe (which at a glance look like something good to do before #9608, but I haven't reviewed it deeply because I'm not that familiar with the network code).\r\n\r\n#9608 is very easy to review and trivial to rebase (or re-write) and personally I think it makes the network code easier to read for people like me (perhaps combined with https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/f1e4e281e3f1eb884f8010ac941c82752174bdbe even more, I haven't tried combining them). In contrast, it seems like this PR would make harder for me to read at a glance (or maybe not, or maybe it is still worth it, I honestly don't know). Although I've written #9608 (which as said is trivial to write IMO, just a little bit painful [could have been lesss painful if I still used eclipse http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2FgettingStarted%2Fqs-ExtractMethod.htm ]), I don't feel very capacitated to review this PR or even https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/f1e4e281e3f1eb884f8010ac941c82752174bdbe which looks much simpler.\r\n",

I think verifying correctness of changes to the processing logic is more complicated under #9608. I'd love to understand what other future considerations you're making though.\r\n\r\nBecause of all of the pesky interactions with our own state, we can only go so far in laying out the rules up-front.\r\n\r\nFor example, someone could be forgiven for assuming (based on the whitelist here) that INVs are processed while importing/reindexing, though in reality, there's only a tiny wallet interaction.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, IsInitialBlockDownload() isn't handled by the dispatcher, leaving it up to individual messages to decide. And that's as it should be, because each message will have their own criteria for that.\r\n\r\nSo if the rules can't be completely enumerated, we're only spreading them out and adding more places to check (or miss). The current behavior (and that of #9608) is to only check for proper handshake behavior outside of individual message parsing. That basically boils down to:\r\n```c++\r\nif (!node->nVersion && strCommand != NetMsgType::VERSION) return;\r\nelse if (!node->fSuccessfullyConnected && strCommand != NetMsgType::VERACK) return;\r\nDispatch(strCommand);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI might be convinced that a slimmed-down version of this that only performed ^^ checks before dispatching would be reasonable.",
