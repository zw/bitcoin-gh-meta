   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\n\r\nThe UI frequently hangs for me, either requiring me to wait a very long time for it to become responsive again, or killing bitcoin-qt and restarting it. \r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n1. Start Bitcoin Core\r\n2. Wait a few minutes\r\n3. Minimize to the taskbar\r\n4. Open the main window by clicking the icon in the taskbar and clicking \"Show / Hide\"\r\n5. Attempt to do anything with the UI. I have found that opening the debug window and attempting to change tabs will usually cause it to hang.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't hang, and I shouldn't need to kill it.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nIt hangs, and usually requires force killing in order make the node come back online (it seems to go offline when it hangs). I am unable to do anything with the GUI.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n\r\nv0.14.99.0-f34cdcb\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- CPU: i7-6800k\r\n- RAM: 32 GB",
