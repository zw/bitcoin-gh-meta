   "body" : "This commit starts the NetworkThread automatically in the test\r\nframework, which means that the individual test cases don't need to\r\nstart the thread after they've added the p2p connections.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the NodeConnCB.add_connection() method to wait for\r\nverack by default. This means the test writer only needs to call\r\nadd_connection() in order to have a p2p connection ready for use.\r\n\r\nThis builds on #10109 . Only the 'Remove NetworkThread from individual test cases' commit needs to be reviewed\r\n\r\nAs discussed @sdaftuar - should be another easy review.",
