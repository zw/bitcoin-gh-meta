      "body" : "Capping transactions to maxtxfee is all well and good, but the unexpected part was the transaction being broadcast with a very low (capped) fee despite the \"setting this too low may abort large transactions\" wording. I believe the transaction in question was in the ~60 KB range and hit the 0.01 limit configured for that wallet, leaving the fee at ~15 sat/byte.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that it would make sense if a transaction is aborted (i.e. not broadcast) if maxtxfee ends up capping the fee to less than paytxfee, as that could indicate a problem. I assume a setting like this is intended as a safeguard against fat-fingered or erroneously calculated fees, but right now with the default setting, it would just limit the fee to ~$120 at today's rate.",
