It is also currently at 1.19.\r\n- [ ] - Write release notes portion outlining LevelDB performance improvements.\r\n\r\n#### LevelDB 1.20 release notes\r\n\r\nConvert documentation to markdown.\r\nImplement support for Intel crc32 instruction (SSE 4.2). Based on [#309](https://github.com/google/leveldb/pull/309).\r\nLimit the number of read-only files the POSIX Env will have open.\r\nAdd option for maximum file size.\r\n\r\n#### related IRC chat\r\n```\r\n15:46:11 sipa: wumpus: btw, LevelDB .20 adds hw accelerated crc for intel\r\n15:46:30 gmaxwell: \\O/\r\n15:48:13 wumpus: sipa: good to know\r\n15:49:12 wumpus: yep https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/master/port/port_posix_sse.cc\r\n15:49:27 wumpus: that will really help our performance (on supported hw0\r\n15:50:35 gmaxwell: should probably do that upgrade sooner rather than later in 0.15 to give time to find any compatiblity issues.\r\n15:50:35 sipa: we may want to add arm code to do the same ourselves\r\n15:51:20 wumpus: indeed\r\n15:57:32 wumpus: yes would make sense to bump our leveldb in master to that soon\r\n15:58:30 sipa: we'll need some build process integration to detect and pass down the SSE defines\r\n15:58:37 sipa: as we bypass their build system\r\n15:58:44 wumpus: would also get https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb/pull/17\r\n15:59:05 wumpus: isn't the SSE stuff at runtime?\r\n15:59:12 wumpus: I'd hope so Ã¯Â¿Â¼\r\n15:59:39 gmaxwell: at least on intel runtime autodetection is simple-- and as I've mentioned before, recent g++ has a sensible looking function overrides based way of doing the substitution.\r\n15:59:56 gmaxwell: but leveldb didn't implement runtime? lameo. \r\n16:00:06 sipa: yes, they detect at runtime\r\n16:00:08 wumpus: they for fact have runtime detection, I saw HaveSSE42 in the file I linked\r\n16:00:20 wumpus: dunno if they use it\r\n16:00:26 sipa: but you still need a compiler that has support for it\r\n16:01:28 wumpus: \"In a separate source file to allow this accelerated CRC32C function to be compiled with the appropriate compiler flags to enable x86 SSE 4.2instructions.\"\r\n16:01:31 wumpus: indeed\r\n16:01:42 wumpus: that specific file needs special compiler flags\r\n16:02:28 sipa: they use intel instrinsics in gcc, not native assembly\r\n16:03:30 gmaxwell: yea thats a pretty normal approach, you have one file compiled with -msse4.2 and dispatch elsewhere calls into it only on the right hardware.\r\n16:04:22 gmaxwell: I think some of the examples for the function overriding stuff used pragmas to push the compiler flags just for that function, so if I'm not misremembering apparently that works.\r\n16:47:07 wumpus: cfields: do you have time to look at integrating the leveldb sse42 stuff into our build system? if not, no problem I'll take a look at it, it doesn't seem particularly difficult though I wouldn't know the autoconf/automake incantation for compiling a file with different flags\r\n16:47:41 sipa: i think i can do it\r\n16:48:06 sipa: ah, nvm, you only want that single file to have -msse4\r\n16:48:25 wumpus: yep, that's the challenge Ã¯Â¿Â¼\r\n16:48:27 sipa: that i fon't know\r\n16:48:30 sipa: *don't\r\n16:50:55 sipa: probably needs a separate .a file?\r\n16:51:01 wumpus: sse4.2 isn't yet widely available enough to compile everything with it, unlike sse2 for example which every 64-bit processor has\r\n16:51:28 wumpus: every 64-bit *x86* processor sorry Ã¯Â¿Â¼\r\n16:51:50 wumpus: sipa: not sure, maybe the attributes can be added per .o file too\r\n17:00:23 sipa: wumpus: as leveldb upstream does not look like they'll pick up my barrier patch anytime soon, i'll submit it to our leveldb repo instead?\r\n17:02:07 wumpus: sipa: sounds good to me\r\n```\r\n",
