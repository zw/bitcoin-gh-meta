It's also useful in testing to be able to control the topology of the test nodes.\r\n\r\n@theuni - I agree that whitelisting is a mess and should be broken out into bits for controlling individual behaviours. Hence my original comment: \"I have a feeling we may want to make the whitelisting behaviour more granular and I don't want to commit us to a public API that we can't then change.\" I was thinking of your comment in #10051 but couldn't find the reference.\r\n\r\n> the idea of adding a command that changes the implied state of a peer via its attributes, rather than performing actions explicitly\r\n\r\nI don't understand what this means in the context of whitelisting. The idea is to update the peer's whitelist behaviour. What would performing actions explicitly entail?",
