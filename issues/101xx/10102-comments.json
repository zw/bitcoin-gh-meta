Nice.\r\nI expected much more code to achieve this.\r\n\r\nConceptually I think this goes into the right direction, though, I'm not sure if this could end up being only a temporary in-between step that may end up being replaced.\r\nBecause, it may be more effective to split the Qt/d part completely and let them communicate over the p2p protocol (SPV and eventually RPC). More effective because it would also allow to run Qt independent from a trusted full node (if not trusted, use mechanism like full block SPV, etc.).\r\n\r\nThough, I'm aware that capnp has an RPC layer. But this would introduce another API (RPC / ZMQ / REST and then capnp RPC).\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is the wrong direction, but we should be careful about adding another API.\r\n\r\nThree questions:\r\n- Would the performance be impractical if we would try to use the existing RPC API?\r\n- Could the capnp approach (or lets say IPC approach) be designed as a (or the) new API (\"JSON RPC v2\" and replacement for ZMQ)?\r\n- Does capnp provide a basic form of authentication?

      "body" : "> Would the performance be impractical if we would try to use the existing RPC API?\r\n\r\nReason this is currently using capnp is not performance but convenience. Capnp provides a high level API that supports bidirectional, synchronous, and asynchronous calls out of the box and allows me to easily explore implementation choices in bitcoin-qt without having to worry about low level protocol details, write a lot of parameter packing/unpacking boilerplate, and implement things like long polling.\r\n\r\nCapnp could definitely be replaced by JSON-RPC, though, and I've gone out of my way to support this by not calling capnp functions or using capnp types or headers anywhere except the `ipc/server.cpp` and `ipc/client.cpp` files. No code outside of these two files has to change in order to move to a different protocol.\r\n\r\n> Could the capnp approach (or lets say IPC approach) be designed as a (or the) new API (\"JSON RPC v2\" and replacement for ZMQ)?\r\n\r\nIt could, but I'm going out of my way right now specifically NOT to add yet another bitcoind public API that could add to the JSON-RPC/REST/ZMQ/-blocknotify/-walletnotify confusion. The IPC here doesn't happen over a TCP port or even a unix socket path but over an anonymous [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) using an inherited file descriptor. (I haven't done a windows implementation yet but [similar things](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683463(v=VS.85).aspx) are possible there).\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make the change completely internal for now and transparent to users. Bitcoin-qt should still be invoked the same way and behave the same way as before, starting its own node and wallet. It just will happen to do this internally now by forking a bitcoind executable rather than calling in-process functions. \r\n\r\nThis change will not add any new command line or GUI options allowing bitcoin-qt to connect to bitcoinds other than the one it spawns internally. Adding these features and supporting new public APIs might be things we want to do in the future, but they would involve downsides and complications that I'm trying to avoid here.\r\n\r\n> Does capnp provide a basic form of authentication? Would that even be required?\r\n\r\nIt's not required here because this change doesn't expose any new socket or endpoint, but it could be supported. Capnp's security model is based on [capabilities](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html#security), so to add authentication, you would just define a factory function that takes credentials as parameters and returns a reference to an object exposing the appropriate functionality.\r\n\r\n",

Or will you provide parameters in a later stage through IPC?\r\n\r\nThe change I'm working on now (not yet pushed) provides the parameters over IPC. It adds an `ipc::Node::parseParameters` method in `client.h` which calls `ParseParameters()` in bitcoind.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n+    //! Set command line arguments.\r\n+    void parseParameters(int argc, const char* const argv[]) const;\r\n+\r\n     //! Get help message string.\r\n     std::string helpMessage(HelpMessageMode mode) const;\r\n \r\n+    //! Start node.\r\n+    bool appInit() const;\r\n+\r\n+    //! Stop node.\r\n+    void appShutdown() const;\r\n+\r\n+    //! Return whether shutdown was requested.\r\n+    bool shutdownRequested() const;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ParseParameters()` is also called on the `bitcoin-qt` side in current change. This gets the job done, but could be improved later, since really the `bitcoind` global variables set by `ParseParameters()` should not even be linked into `bitcoin-qt`.",

This should help give a clearer picture of the layers involved in implementing an IPC call.\r\n\r\n* Instead of adding Cap'n Proto code and modifying Qt code in a single commit, it includes a new early commit ([`1407a2b Add ipc::Node and ipc::Wallet interfaces`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/1407a2bb0b0a3ab21ae374b58980bb0dc53b12c5) that introduces new [`src/ipc/interfaces.h`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/ipc/interfaces.h)  and [`src/ipc/interfaces.cpp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/ipc/interfaces.cpp) files and ports Qt code to use them without any Cap'n Proto stuff. This shows the separation between Qt updates and IPC implementation details better and makes it easier to see how a different IPC system could be substituted in for Cap'n Proto. This commit could even be made into a separate PR.\r\n",

      "body" : "@laanwj pointed out in IRC (https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/83983170/) that this change could help make the GUI more responsive by preventing Qt event processing from getting blocked, which currently happens in the monolithic `bitcoin-qt` when the main GUI thread makes a call to a slow libbitcoin function, or waits a long time for a `cs_main` or `cs_wallet` lock.\r\n\r\nAt the time in IRC, I didn't think this change could directly help gui responsiveness, because although it does move libbitcoin and LOCK calls out of the `bitcoin-qt` process and into the `bitcoind` process, it just replaces these calls with blocking IPCs that make the GUI equally unresponsive when they tie up the main GUI thread.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't have to be the case. The place where IPC calls currently block waiting for responses is the `return promise.get_future().get();` line in `ipc::util::Call::send` method here: https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.4/src/ipc/util.h#L166\r\n\r\nBut the `std::promise` object used in that line could easily be replaced with a Qt-aware promise object that processes GUI events while the promise is blocked. (The Qt-aware promise implementation would check if it is being used on the main GUI thread, and if so use a [local Qt event loop](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq27-responsive-guis.html#waitinginalocaleventloop) substituting\r\n`loop.exec()` for `std::future::get()` and `loop.quit()` for `std::promise::set_value()`.)\r\n\r\nThis would add more overhead and make the average IPC call a little slower. But it would avoid situations where an unexpectedly slow IPC call ties up the whole gui, so it might be worth doing anyway.",

      "body" : "@Sjors, this is great! Thanks so much for testing this.\r\n\r\n> The documentation suggests multiprocess isn't on by default, but it is:\r\n\r\nSince `--enable-multiprocess` configure option only builds new executables and has no effect on existing ones, the default value is `auto` rather than `no`. This seems like the most convenient behavior, but I coudl change it or try to document it better.\r\n\r\n> I do still see a few warnings that appear related to this change:\r\n\r\nI also saw the syscall warning and plan to fix it. It's not serious problem, but a side effect seems to be that bad thread numbers are shown in the debug log.\r\n\r\n> Should the test suite use these new binaries? In order to prevent the functional suite from taking forever to run, perhaps half of the default test suite nodes could use bitcoind and the other half bitcoin-node?\r\n\r\nI'm planning on adding `--multiprocess` and `--gui` options to the python test framework to make it easier to switch between `bitcoin`, `bitcoin-qt`, `bitcoin-node`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables. All 4 of these should work, though some tests fail with `bitcoin-node` right now. I think default test mode should use `bitcoind` but travis should be configured to test other binaries, too.\r\n\r\n> The bitcoin-gui executable is ignoring testnet=1 in bitcoin.conf. bitcoin-node does honor it. When launched with -testnet it correctly sees global options in bitcoin.conf., but it missed or incorrectly parses options for [test].\r\n\r\nInteresting, this is not expected. Will debug.\r\n\r\n> Should the log file specify which process is generating each entry? Or should each process have its own log file, where the master process just logs \"started/stopped bitcoin-node process PID=....\"?\r\n\r\nEach process has its own log file and I extended the `combine_logs.py` script to be able to merge them. The log files just have simple suffixes right now so are named `debug.log` `debug.log.wallet` and `debug.log.gui`. The followup change I'm working on to add `-ipconnect` and `-ipcbind` options will allow multiple wallet and gui processes, so these names will no longer be unique and I'll have to add pid suffixes as well.\r\n\r\nWriting to a common log file would be another option, but it would require some kind of locking and syncing, so I don't think the complexity would be worth it.\r\n\r\n> I did some light GUI testing as well.\r\n\r\nThanks! I'll look into the various problems you reported and make fixes.",

I will test the createwallet method, fix git ignores, and clean up the disconnect handling so leftover processes won't stick around if one crashes.\r\n\r\nOn location of `bitcoin-gui`, all three executables are intentionally built in the same directory to make spawning processes simple. When `bitcoin-gui` launches `bitcoin-node`, it always looks for a `bitcoin-node` executable in the same directory. Same when `bitcoin-node` runs `bitcoin-wallet`. Trying to build and call executables in different directories would make things unnecessarily complicated, especially if the executables will eventually be installed in the same directory anyway.",

This PR isn't adding signal handlers to spawned `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-wallet` processes so ctrl-c can kill them immediately and trigger sudden disconnects and IPC errors. I think adding simple signal handlers would be a good thing to do in a followup PR, and also in general recovering from sudden IPC disconnects is something that should be improved later.\r\n\r\nIn the

From my view this seems like the step where we need to decide to use capnproto or not, and if not, what sort of replacement library. Personally I think using capnproto is a decent idea, as it's a well maintained project, and can save us from a lot of the common bugs we might otherwise run into if we rolled our own. OTOH it's a big codebase so we might want to tread carefully.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it seems that we're using CapnProto in a *very* limited way. CapnProto is designed to be usable as a layer between untrusted peers (e.g., at the network consensus layer). This isn't what's going on here. In our usage here it's only between trusted node components. Even without CapnProto, if your wallet user wants to mess with your node they can do some heavy damage, so I don't really see a *new* attack surface. In fact, I see less attack surface because now if someone pops your node handling network stuff they can't get to your private keys. That seems like a major improvement over the status quo, even at the expense of a new, complex, library.\r\n\r\nCurious to hear what other's think and if we can move ahead with capnproto.",

This way, all tests are updated when compiled with ipc and it would avoid having to update them manually and individually.\r\n\r\nThat's a good idea, I didn't know about the timeout factor and it'd probably better to increase that if there are other timeouts outside this test. Some IPC performance problems are actually very easy to fix after you know they exist, though, so there might be some argument for increasing timeouts selectively instead of globally to identify these places, at least to start out with before it becomes a burden.",

Just like you can build versions of bitcoin without GUI or wallet support, and just like we distribute separate `bitcoin-qt` and `bitcoind` binaries so you can choose whether or not to use [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), you will always be able to build bitcoin without multiprocess support. Also, you can also choose whether to use multiprocess binaries.\r\n\r\nMultiprocess support is disabled by default in this PR (toggled by the [`--enable-multiprocess`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/doc/multiprocess.md) option), and even when it is enabled it just creates new `bitcoin-gui`, `bitcoin-node`, and `bitcoin-wallet` binaries without any effect on existing `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` binaries.\r\n\r\nBeyond the ability to disable multiprocess support, there is also the ability to enable it and replace it with a different implementation. For example, if you want multiprocess support, but would prefer not to rely on the external [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) library, you could implement a class overriding [`interfaces::Ipc`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/interfaces/ipc.h) with methods `spawnProcess`, `serveProcess`, `connectAddress`, `listenAddress` that use a different IPC protocol or are implemented with different libraries.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased 585585c28f69cc232c2f9e6d1ae96c8d3a11eb5a -> a43b55a381b023800f9f5f68a2a56a1e374ab19f ([`pr/ipc.143`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.143) -> [`pr/ipc.144`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.144), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc.143-rebase..pr/ipc.144)) on #19160 pr/ipc-echo.27 due to conflicts with #20685 and #21015\r\nRebased a43b55a381b023800f9f5f68a2a56a1e374ab19f -> 26bc68baf4d221bfd45cb4c61556fd5851376e84 ([`pr/ipc.144`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.144) -> [`pr/ipc.145`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.145), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc.144-rebase..pr/ipc.145)) due to conflict with bitcoin-core/gui#233\r\nRebased 26bc68baf4d221bfd45cb4c61556fd5851376e84 -> 667affafa4b1a086746de9ef17c459e40380829b ([`pr/ipc.145`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.145) -> [`pr/ipc.146`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.146), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc.145-rebase..pr/ipc.146)) due to conflicts with #21007 and #21404\r\n",

Just checking out the current PR and following the instructions builds successfully for me (and also seems to be working on CI).\r\n\r\nIt's possible there are old build outputs on your system and using `git-clean` could help. Otherwise it'd be great if you opened a new issue https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/new including the complete error message (maybe with `make V=1` to be able to see the linker command line). From the snippet above, it's not clear what executable is actually being linked or if the symbol should be expected to be defined there.\r\n\r\nIn the future feel free to post any questions or issues related to multiprocess stuff to https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/new. Even though libmultiprocess isn't bitcoin-specific, the issue tracker is a pretty quiet and reasonable place for discussion, even if issues are tangential. This PR thread is long and it's hard to have ongoing discussion about specific topics here.",

I wonder if you are using a bitcoin.conf file or have log options defined that could be relevant to this.\r\n\r\n> I am not really a fan of overloading `bitcoin-wallet` to serve as the wallet process. Currently (in master) it is used solely as the wallet tool. It seems really weird to me that with this PR it's behavior is completely different depending on whether it is given `-ipcfd`. I would rather that the wallet process is a new binary instead of overloading the current `bitcoin-wallet`.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to have one wallet tool instead of multiple tools. This is described a little in #19460 (feel free to follow up there). `-ipcfd` is an internal argument that users shouldn't care about, but #19460 adds an `-ipcconnect` option to control whether `bitcoin-wallet` tries to connect to the `bitcoin-node` IPC socket. The idea would be that\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbitcoin-wallet -noipcconnect    -wallet=mywallet listtransactions  # List limited transaction info\r\nbitcoin-wallet -ipcconnect      -wallet=mywallet listtransactions  # List full transaction info\r\nbitcoin-wallet -ipcconnect=auto -wallet=mywallet listtransactions  # List available transaction info\r\n\r\nbitcoin-wallet -noipcconnect    -wallet=mywallet serve # Run limited RPC server\r\nbitcoin-wallet -ipcconnect      -wallet=mywallet serve # Run full RPC server\r\nbitcoin-wallet -ipcconnect=auto -wallet=mywallet serve # Run full server if possible, but fall back to limited\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault `-ipcconnect` option value might be a discussion point but in #19460 it is `auto`.\r\n\r\n> The last commit seems to be extremely monolithic. It would be nice to break it up into several smaller commits if possible.\r\n\r\nYes, that's the plan. It needs to be split up and also has a few hacks that need to be removed. (Some of the hacks in fact are related to logging and could be responsible for the issue you reported).",

Sometimes it's hard to follow which objects are defined in `bitcoin`, which ones are in `libmultiprocess` and which ones are dynamically generated by `mpgen`. Though i agree it's fine for now, we can improve with time.\r\n\r\n`init_process` is bitcoin-specific and libmultiprocess can't access it or reference it, and it isn't related to IPC method invocation (`serverInvoke` is a libmultiprocess internal function that bitcoin code shouldn't access and doesn't reference which translates an incoming IPC method call from a remote process to a C++ method call on a local object.)\r\n\r\n`init_process` is a hack to deal with the fact that bitcoin code uses a bunch of global variables that depend on the `gArgs` global variable and they need to be initialized at some point.\r\n\r\nWhen bitcoin is running with wallet & node & gui code in the same process, global variables only have to be initialized once by existing init code. But if the node process spawns a wallet process, or if the GUI process spawns a node process, then there are multiple copies of the global variables in different processes, and they have to be newly initialized in each spawned process, and existing init code is no longer sufficient. That is why the `GlobalArgs` class and `init_process` callback are introduced. `GlobalArgs` transfers `gArgs` state from the parent process to the child process and `init_process` sets up logging and other global variables that depend on `gArgs`.\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be no global variables shared between node wallet and GUI code (they would move into `NodeContext` and `WalletContext` objects) and the `init_process` hack could go away. Short of that, I maybe rename `init_process` or you could think of it as something like `init_bitcoin_shared_global_variables_in_newly_spawned_child_process_after_transferring_gargs`",

It's basically a UUID that acts like a namespace for types defined in the file. It is generated by running [`capnp id`](https://capnproto.org/capnp-tool.html), and is used as a form of namespacing to ensure that even if types from different files or different projects have the same names, their binary representations won't conflict and there wont be any ambiguities in the protocol if objects from different files are serialized together.\r\n\r\nI could add a comment like `# Random unique identifier for this Cap'n Proto schema file generated by \"capnp id\"` to the top of every `.capnp` file if that would be helpful. Opting not to for now since it seems maybe too verbose like writing `/* This is an include guard to prevent this header from being included twice. */` in a C header.",

IPC does slow things down generally, like running on a slow machine, and I think it's expected that if you run code in a new environment, you may need to adjust some parameters that didn't have enough tolerance.\r\n\r\nIt's true that there are a lot of places where we can change application code to have better performance over IPC (basically just places IPC methods are called in a repeatedly and we can reduce the number of round trips), but it wouldn't seem seem appropriate to put comments about it here in the middle of this one test.",

I've followed up with some fixes.\r\n\r\nTaproot crash was caused by failing to serialize `WitnessV1Taproot` variant of `CTxDestination`. I fixed the problem and added an assertion to make the cause more obvious if `CTxDestination` is expanded again. I also tested sending and receiving and fixed problems with `CScript` and `Coin` serialization that were causing similar crashes. It does look like send and receive labels are displayed correctly in the transaction list now, but I'm not sure if this is because I fixed something, or am just not reproducing the bug. if you see more problems I'd like to know, and thanks again for testing!\r\n\r\nUpdated 05e236772da0ed9396ce269b5fe8384b0de8e775 -> d0bea139b7a4a158eea6fec62285646a826a62b9 ([`pr/ipc.176`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.176) -> [`pr/ipc.177`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc.177), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc.176..pr/ipc.177)) with fixes",

      "body" : "Thanks @Sjors. I've tried a lot of things and have not been able to reproduce the crash exactly, but the log you posted was  helpful, and I could reproduce similar error output by adding an extra call from bitcoin-node to bitcoin-wallet that sleeps in bitcoin-wallet, and then manual killing `bitcoin-wallet` process. When I do that I see similar `kj::Exception` errors on the bitcoin-node main thread and bitcoin-node b-capnp-loop thread like in your log.  In your log the exact errors are `kj/async-io-unix.c++:498: disconnected: ::read(fd, buffer, maxBytes): Connection reset by peer` while in my case they are `kj::Exception: capnp/rpc.c++:2421: disconnected: Peer disconnected.` But maybe this is a macos vs linux platform difference, because otherwise the errors seem identical. \r\n\r\nThe upshot of this is that I think somehow `bitcoin-wallet` process is crashing on shutdown and causing the `bitcoin-node` unexpected network disconnect errors. Could debug this by:\r\n\r\n- Seeing if `~/.bitcoin/debug.log.wallet` has more information\r\n- Attaching to `bitcoin-wallet` process with GDB before it crashes with `gdb src/bitcoin-wallet <bitcoin-wallet pid>`\r\n- Running `bitcoin-node` under GDB to see what wallet method it is calling when the wallet crashes. From the IPC log it seems to be calling ChainClient.flush, but if you run `gdb -ex 'catch throw' -ex run --args src/bitcoin-node -debug=ipc` it might be possible to get a more complete stack trace\r\n\r\nI should look more into WalletLoaderImpl::flush method to see what that could be doing to cause a crash, too.",

See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\n> \n> The change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\n> \n> The IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Slides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\n> \n\n",

Running plain `make` works fine every time, and _sometimes_ a low job number works too.\r\n\r\nThe Makefile [appears](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/56ef459b573461087fbe4f39d9b0a7108936335f/src/Makefile.am#L1083-L1098) (to me) to have the dependencies listed correctly, so I'm not entirely sure what's going wrong, but just thought I'd report here in case anyone else had a similar issue. Also, likely not worth actually fixing now before a move to CMake.",
