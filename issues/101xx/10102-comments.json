Nice.\r\nI expected much more code to achieve this.\r\n\r\nConceptually I think this goes into the right direction, though, I'm not sure if this could end up being only a temporary in-between step that may end up being replaced.\r\nBecause, it may be more effective to split the Qt/d part completely and let them communicate over the p2p protocol (SPV and eventually RPC). More effective because it would also allow to run Qt independent from a trusted full node (if not trusted, use mechanism like full block SPV, etc.).\r\n\r\nThough, I'm aware that capnp has an RPC layer. But this would introduce another API (RPC / ZMQ / REST and then capnp RPC).\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is the wrong direction, but we should be careful about adding another API.\r\n\r\nThree questions:\r\n- Would the performance be impractical if we would try to use the existing RPC API?\r\n- Could the capnp approach (or lets say IPC approach) be designed as a (or the) new API (\"JSON RPC v2\" and replacement for ZMQ)?\r\n- Does capnp provide a basic form of authentication?

      "body" : "> Would the performance be impractical if we would try to use the existing RPC API?\r\n\r\nReason this is currently using capnp is not performance but convenience. Capnp provides a high level API that supports bidirectional, synchronous, and asynchronous calls out of the box and allows me to easily explore implementation choices in bitcoin-qt without having to worry about low level protocol details, write a lot of parameter packing/unpacking boilerplate, and implement things like long polling.\r\n\r\nCapnp could definitely be replaced by JSON-RPC, though, and I've gone out of my way to support this by not calling capnp functions or using capnp types or headers anywhere except the `ipc/server.cpp` and `ipc/client.cpp` files. No code outside of these two files has to change in order to move to a different protocol.\r\n\r\n> Could the capnp approach (or lets say IPC approach) be designed as a (or the) new API (\"JSON RPC v2\" and replacement for ZMQ)?\r\n\r\nIt could, but I'm going out of my way right now specifically NOT to add yet another bitcoind public API that could add to the JSON-RPC/REST/ZMQ/-blocknotify/-walletnotify confusion. The IPC here doesn't happen over a TCP port or even a unix socket path but over an anonymous [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) using an inherited file descriptor. (I haven't done a windows implementation yet but [similar things](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683463(v=VS.85).aspx) are possible there).\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make the change completely internal for now and transparent to users. Bitcoin-qt should still be invoked the same way and behave the same way as before, starting its own node and wallet. It just will happen to do this internally now by forking a bitcoind executable rather than calling in-process functions. \r\n\r\nThis change will not add any new command line or GUI options allowing bitcoin-qt to connect to bitcoinds other than the one it spawns internally. Adding these features and supporting new public APIs might be things we want to do in the future, but they would involve downsides and complications that I'm trying to avoid here.\r\n\r\n> Does capnp provide a basic form of authentication? Would that even be required?\r\n\r\nIt's not required here because this change doesn't expose any new socket or endpoint, but it could be supported. Capnp's security model is based on [capabilities](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html#security), so to add authentication, you would just define a factory function that takes credentials as parameters and returns a reference to an object exposing the appropriate functionality.\r\n\r\n",

Or will you provide parameters in a later stage through IPC?\r\n\r\nThe change I'm working on now (not yet pushed) provides the parameters over IPC. It adds an `ipc::Node::parseParameters` method in `client.h` which calls `ParseParameters()` in bitcoind.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n+    //! Set command line arguments.\r\n+    void parseParameters(int argc, const char* const argv[]) const;\r\n+\r\n     //! Get help message string.\r\n     std::string helpMessage(HelpMessageMode mode) const;\r\n \r\n+    //! Start node.\r\n+    bool appInit() const;\r\n+\r\n+    //! Stop node.\r\n+    void appShutdown() const;\r\n+\r\n+    //! Return whether shutdown was requested.\r\n+    bool shutdownRequested() const;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ParseParameters()` is also called on the `bitcoin-qt` side in current change. This gets the job done, but could be improved later, since really the `bitcoind` global variables set by `ParseParameters()` should not even be linked into `bitcoin-qt`.",

It just gets handled by the capnp event loop, which waits for incoming IPC messages and dispatches to `InitMessageCallback::Server::call` and other server methods. The change I'm working on now (not yet pushed) spawns a new thread in ipc/client.cpp to run the event loop.",

This should help give a clearer picture of the layers involved in implementing an IPC call.\r\n\r\n* Instead of adding Cap'n Proto code and modifying Qt code in a single commit, it includes a new early commit ([`1407a2b Add ipc::Node and ipc::Wallet interfaces`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/1407a2bb0b0a3ab21ae374b58980bb0dc53b12c5) that introduces new [`src/ipc/interfaces.h`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/ipc/interfaces.h)  and [`src/ipc/interfaces.cpp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/ipc/interfaces.cpp) files and ports Qt code to use them without any Cap'n Proto stuff. This shows the separation between Qt updates and IPC implementation details better and makes it easier to see how a different IPC system could be substituted in for Cap'n Proto. This commit could even be made into a separate PR.\r\n",

      "body" : "@laanwj pointed out in IRC (https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/83983170/) that this change could help make the GUI more responsive by preventing Qt event processing from getting blocked, which currently happens in the monolithic `bitcoin-qt` when the main GUI thread makes a call to a slow libbitcoin function, or waits a long time for a `cs_main` or `cs_wallet` lock.\r\n\r\nAt the time in IRC, I didn't think this change could directly help gui responsiveness, because although it does move libbitcoin and LOCK calls out of the `bitcoin-qt` process and into the `bitcoind` process, it just replaces these calls with blocking IPCs that make the GUI equally unresponsive when they tie up the main GUI thread.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't have to be the case. The place where IPC calls currently block waiting for responses is the `return promise.get_future().get();` line in `ipc::util::Call::send` method here: https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.4/src/ipc/util.h#L166\r\n\r\nBut the `std::promise` object used in that line could easily be replaced with a Qt-aware promise object that processes GUI events while the promise is blocked. (The Qt-aware promise implementation would check if it is being used on the main GUI thread, and if so use a [local Qt event loop](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq27-responsive-guis.html#waitinginalocaleventloop) substituting\r\n`loop.exec()` for `std::future::get()` and `loop.quit()` for `std::promise::set_value()`.)\r\n\r\nThis would add more overhead and make the average IPC call a little slower. But it would avoid situations where an unexpectedly slow IPC call ties up the whole gui, so it might be worth doing anyway.",

      "body" : "> This change will not add any new command line or GUI options allowing bitcoin-qt to connect to bitcoinds other than the one it spawns internally. Adding these features and supporting new public APIs might be things we want to do in the future, but they would involve downsides and complications that I'm trying to avoid here.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the goal here. On itself, there seems little benefit in separating the GUI and the rest into separate processes if those two processes still depend on each other (this is different from separating the wallet from the node, for example, as there as security considerations there... but for that use case the easiest approach seems to just have a lightweight mode and running two instances).\r\n\r\nI think it would be awesome if bitcoin-qt could be started and stopped independently to control a bitcoind process in the background, but if that's not the intent, what is the purpose?",

That means there are 50 places to update if you want bitcoin-qt handle to events while the function calls are executing. WIth the IPC framework, there is only one place you have to update instead of 50 places (if you want to do this).\r\n\r\n> On itself, there seems little benefit in separating the GUI and the rest into separate processes if those two processes still depend on each other.\r\n\r\nOk, so you think the benefits are small, and I think they are more significant.\r\n\r\n> I think it would be awesome if bitcoin-qt could be started and stopped independently to control a bitcoind process in the background,\r\n\r\nThis is trivial once bitcoin-qt is controlling bitcoind across a socket.
