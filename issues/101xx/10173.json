   "body" : "On 0.14 from bitcoin.org binaries, a sendmany TX doesn't get decomposed properly in the UI.\r\n\r\nA TX was created that spent coins behind the UI's back.  (It was made with createraw but is basically a sendmany, apart from not using a fresh change address.)  This TX (ID 32a4915187c0e3213696903b05ee029b20a9e4c3cf4873b1be165593de5155c3) sent 0.001 to each of three addresses; two non-ismine and one ismine (1MichaiL1SZsctjm4gwoSZEueCWN38i4RW) for the change.  In the UI, personally I'd expect to see one of the following:\r\n * each non-ismine destination and corresponding amount on its own \"transaction split\" line, or\r\n * one line summarising the total spent to non-ismine destinations, not attempting to split them up, or\r\n * something indicating that this tx can't be decomposed at all\r\n\r\nThere's [a screenshot of what actually appeared](https://i.imgur.com/Q2A4vsB.png) (for some reason I can't attach it right now).  It appears to misidentify which addresses are owned by the wallet; the split labelled `1JGW...` is clearly either wrongly labelled or has the wrong amount, and it's unclear whether `1Eig...` is that output or mislabelled change. @gmaxwell kindly eyeballed this quickly and said \"it renders sendmany normally, but it looks like it's wonking up ismine\".\r\n\r\nA sanity-checking console interaction verifying the ismine-ness is available [in a pastebin](https://pastebin.com/seH6qFD7) too.",
