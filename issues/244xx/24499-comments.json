Some parts of our code are just impossible to reach (belt-and-suspender code, `src/util/check.h`-failures, ...) and it would be good to have a mutation engine that can deal with this. It seems unlikely that we'll do major refactors to our consensus code to kill mutants, so a mutation engine that can take the fingerprint of mutants and put them in a \"harmless\"-bucket seems ideal. This would be beneficial because a large part of mutation testing Bitcoin Core is categorizing mutants into harmless/harmful and doing it at most once per mutation allows more time to be spent on \"fixing\" the harmful ones.\r\n",

If you have an idea of what would be useful to do to STL code, I imagine I could add it to UM myself.\r\n\r\nUM supports annotating a _line_ as DO_NOT_MUTATE permanently, and adding that for file or block of code would be easy (you can actually do it for a block/file now with an annotation marking as \"test code\" but it'd be nice to not have to claim the un-killable parts are test code).\r\n\r\nDownside is UM is fairly slow at generation, and doesn't inherently do any tricks to speed evaluation of mutants.  But I'm not sure a currently working C/C++ tool exists that supports that kind of thing.",

      "body" : "Hello, @agroce \r\n\r\nI've been testing `universalmutator` for a time and I thought it very cool, especially because it is scriptable. I created a [Python script](https://github.com/brunoerg/bitcoin/blob/2022-04-universal-mutation/test/mutation/mutation.py) similar to what I found on your `tests` folder and it worked very well with Bitcoin Core. I am using the functional tests to analyze the mutations. Compared to other libs I tested with the same proposal, `universalmutation` is one of my favorites (one of the reasons is the `analyze_mutation`). \r\n\r\nHowever, since it is a tool for many languages, not 100% focused on C++, it makes some mistakes when mutating c++ files I guess. \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n1. It mutate comments:\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```cpp\r\n* The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best\r\n * solution is chosen by minimizing the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to\r\n * spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long term expected cost to spend the\r\n * inputs, plus the amount by which the selection exceeds the spending target:\r\n *\r\n * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs Ã (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\r\n *\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n```cpp\r\n* The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best\r\n * solution is chosen by minimizing the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to\r\n * spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long term expected cost to spend the\r\n * inputs, plus the amount by which the selection exceeds the spending target:\r\n /\r\n * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs Ã (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\r\n *\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n* The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best\r\n * solution is chosen by minimizing the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to\r\n continue; spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long term expected cost to spend the\r\n * inputs, plus the amount by which the selection exceeds the spending target:\r\n continue;\r\n * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs Ã (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\r\n *\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it is considering the `*` as an operator even though it's inside a comment block.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. It mutates imports\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <consensus/amount.h>\r\n#include <policy/feerate.h>\r\n#include <util/check.h>\r\n#include <util/system.h>\r\n#include <util/moneystr.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <consensus/amount.h/\r\n#include <policy/feerate.h>\r\n#include <util/check.h>\r\n#include <util/system.h>\r\n#include <util/moneystr.h>\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n#include <consensus/amount.h>\r\n#include <policy/feerate.h>\r\n#include <util/check.h<\r\n#include <util/system.h>\r\n#include <util/moneystr.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's unnecessary to mutate the `includes`. It is probably considering the `<` and `>` as operators even being in an `include`. Anyway, `universalmutator` is very good but needs some improves related to c++. I will create an issue in your repository pointing out some improvements in addition to those mentioned here.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
