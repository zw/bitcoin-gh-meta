For our official releases, we still build with hidden symbols as before, we just also link libstdc++ statically. The change here in that regard is that --disable-reduced-exports becomes the default in our configure... builders can re-enable if they'd like (as we do).

Qt's throw/catch usage should be fine because their types are dynamically loaded, and we don't export them.\r\n\r\nI think the worrisome case would be if qt throws us a std::exception. In that case, I'm really not sure what definition is used. Though from a quick grep, it looks like that never happens.\r\n\r\nThat's all conjecture though. I'd like to have hard evidence. Beyond expanding our sanity checks to other std exceptions, can you think of other tests we could add here?",

      "body" : "@theuni Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. I'm not only worried about exceptions, but as I see it this will result in Qt and bitcoin-qt using different versions of libstdc++. The two versions of libstdc++ may have slightly different interpretations of types. When stdc++ types are passed across the dynamic library barrier (for example for QString::fromStdStding) this could cause potential issues. Another potential cause of issues are global data structures in libstdc++.\r\n\r\nI know this is a common issue on Windows, at least. Maybe there is some magic workaround, but it seems brittle to me. A way to invite unknown unknowns. Hence I'm not so much convinced by 'it happens to work on X'.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation when statically linking libstdc++ statically is to also link all c++ libraries statically. See e.g. http://www.trilithium.com/johan/2005/06/static-libstdc . Dynamic linking of C libraries is fine.\r\n\r\n> For Linux, when compiling against a new libstdc++ but using an older one at runtime\r\n\r\n- The caveman solution that comes to mind is: build against an old libstdc++.\r\n- Or should we bite the bullet and link Qt statically. More and more that sounds like the only robust solution (remember the OpenSSL interop issues). Static qt5 sucks on Ubuntu, but that is cosmetic and preferable to these kinds of issues.\r\n",
