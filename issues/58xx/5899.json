   "body" : "Thoughts on adding a new RPC command like `importx` that imports a known transaction ID directly into the wallet? Or, when calling `importprivkey`, add another parameter that tells the rescan to only go as far back as the block specified? e.g. (`importprivkey <privkey> rescan=true xxxxxx`) Maybe both?\r\n\r\nMy use case:\r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with stealth addresses and as the receiver of a stealth payment, you don't know the private key in advance to redeem your funds. This is calculated using data from one of the null outputs (OP_RETURN). When you find a match and the associated private key, you need to import it into your wallet. Since the transaction ID is already known, this makes a rescan unnecessary and a waste of resources, unfortunately it must be done though if you want the balance and transaction to be added to the wallet.",
