      "body" : "A while ago there was extensive discussion on the mailing list, that it was bad idea to expose addresses to the end user. This is in line with increasing usage of payment requests, and other innovation.\r\n\r\nOf course there are some edge cases where you do want the address, but in that case you can click on the transaction to get full information (or even hover?). It seems pointless to show the address for every single transaction. So I'm closing this.",
