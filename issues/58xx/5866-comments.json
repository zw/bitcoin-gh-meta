I did it myself in cloned sourcecode as a part of addnode rpc command (addnode IP:port ban) and it seems to work, the ban code also performs disconnect. However just disconnecting can be less of use since that peer can reconnect right away (unless we are blocking incoming connections).\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is some peers disconnecting/banning other peers that are syncing with network, for example people with low upload limit that are lagged (I myself have max ~80KiB/s upload). I doubt that it will be abused to that extent, but it can always hurt the network, though.",
