      "body" : "Hey @RHavar,\r\n\r\nthe difference between `\"*\"` and `\"\"` is that the first one sums all unspent outputs, while the second one considers only those with the account label `\"\"`. Even though `\"\"` appears to be the default label, you probably have at least one with a different label.\r\n\r\n`getbalance` and `getbalance \"*\" 0` should return the same result.\r\n`getbalance \"*\"` should return the sum of unspent outputs, but with at least one confirmation.",

If I had two accounts, it would be more. Running `bitcoind listaccounts` also shows I only have a single account \"\". Right now everything looks sane, but only because I have no unconfirmed funds/change.",
