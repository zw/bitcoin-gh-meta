Personally I rather have (run of the mill) sub-windows just pop up relative to their main window instead of wherever I had them last time.\r\nThe main window itself and the RPC console are exceptions to this as people will want to keep them open at the same time and not overlapping. But for the options window I just don't see the point.\r\n\r\n@paveljanik Nice idea. Most straightforward would be to remember the visibility of the debug window as well as the position? Seems more intuitive than adding an option.\r\n",
