I introduced the `deprecatedrpc` flag in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11031. The idea is that downstream users have at least one release where both the old API and new API are valid. To use the old API, the user *must* take action (enable the flag). That means they can't not be aware that the old API is being deprecated in the next version. The alternative would be just to have a written warning, which could easily be missed by users.\r\n\r\nIs the `deprecatedrpc` burdensome for users? If so, do you have a suggestion for a better way to deprecate old APIs?",

But that's been deprecated and effectively renamed to `signrawtransactionwithwallet` in 0.17.\r\n\r\nOk, cool, I'm aware of that. So what should I do? Use the `signrawtransactionwithwallet` but now it has a hard dependency on 0.17. Or should I continue to use `signrawtransaction` but require running with `-deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction` in 0.17 ?  This is a problem that all the bindings need to deal with too now, and there's no good solution (unless you expect them to do \"feature detection\" and dynamically switch between the two, but at that point it raises that question of was is _really_ worth creating all that complexity for applications, just so you're sure they're aware of your deprecation schedule?) .\r\n\r\nThe fact is this sort of deprecation stops allowing smooth upgrades, and honestly -- I don't think you can justify it the aggressiveness of it. It's my experience that a WARN_ONCE style deprecation system is vastly superior and smoother. Yes, it's easier to ignore -- but those people will end up hurting themselves -- for everyone else, everything just goes smoother.\r\n\r\nAnd probably more importantly: if the system uses deprecation warnings I can just do the upgrade, and then migrate away from the deprecated methods at my leisure. While with the deprecated-method-hidden-behind-a-flag system, I need to *upfront* know exactly which rpc methods my application is using (which might not be obvious or easy to find, especially so if I'm using libraries/code I didn't write myself) and most likely pressured into doing a more complex simultaneous release of my code + bitcoin-core as no one likes turning on deprecated flags :P\r\n\r\nI also think deprecation schedule can be slower unless there's some tangible benefit for it (e.g. cleaning up the code to make it easier to work with). An aggressive schedule for renaming `signrawtransaction` to `signrawtransactionwithwallet` seems a bit overzealous.\r\n\r\n(And I do think this stuff benefits by a more case-by-case analysis, some stuff can't go fast enough for sure)",
