My use case (which I assume is not an uncommon one) is simply to assign one or more addresses to a user by means of a unique account/label, and then query for incoming transactions to that user on certain events. As long as `listtransactions` can still be used for this, everything else is a trivial update.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this.",
