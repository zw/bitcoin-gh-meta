I can immediately update my software to acknowledge signrawtransaction is deprecated. Now it's immediately compatible with both 0.16 and 0.17.  \r\n\r\nWhy would you do that? Why not just `acknowledge_deprecated=true` all the time?  \r\n\r\nIf I'd be a developer, I would prefer releasing software that doesn't break user software, even when if the user updates its underlying Core instance.  \r\n\r\nThus, I'd keep sending `acknowledge_deprecated=true` flag preemptively, even for calls I think would never be changed, just to be sure, because what is the downside? Nothing really.  \r\n\r\nIt must also be noted that the difference between `acknowledge_deprecated=true` and `-deprecatedrpc=<methodname>` is that, the developer may not want to (or can) mess up with `-deprecatedrpc=<methodname>` lines the config file for all rpc command it uses before the RPC would break. That just smells like a very dirty solution, compared to setting a simple flag true.  \r\n\r\nAnyhow, I'm not arguing for or against here, just giving some feedback on how the change would be used.",

It's also not easy to ask those users to upgrade, because when they upgrade it'll potentially break a bunch of other stuff they are doing. \r\n\r\nHonestly, the more I think about it, the more I think the current setup is over-engineered. I really think the best solution would be a sort of WARN_ONCE for deprecated methods, write to a deprecated.log . Then if people don't read the release notes (and previous warnings, or search the deprecated log) and get burnt upgrading -- then it's their problem. ",
