Each arg would be a json value (c.f. https://gist.github.com/karel-3d/1490786786525b0365ea8f459a9fc683#examples-1) with the type and the name to be used when calling with named arguments. Also, each arg would have flags for optional/required (and a default for non-required args), as well as a short description string.\r\n\r\nFurther enhancements would be to do the same for the result (returned json) and finally to check the types provided in the documentation against the types passed during runtime.",
