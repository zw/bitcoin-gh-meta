   "body" : "This PR introduces a faster input deduplication algorithm.\r\n\r\nIn the first commit, I introduce a worst case duplicate input benchmark.\r\n\r\nThe existing code achieves the following performance.\r\n\r\nDuplicateInputs, 5, 10, 0.710982, 0.0140756, 0.0143986, 0.0141852\r\n\r\nIn the next commit, I introduce a probabilistic checker which is much faster. It's analysis and use is documented extensively in the code comments. It achieves the following performance on the same benchmark.\r\n\r\nDuplicateInputs, 5, 10, 0.166576, 0.00329314, 0.0034048, 0.0033221\r\n\r\nThis is about 4.3X faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture work can further improve this by back-grounding the checks and hashing to another thread.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does introduce one behavior change in which DoS error gets reported for transactions which have both duplicates and null inputs; the first error found will be the one reported.",
