When I `brew uninstall` and then `brew install` it, compilation indeed fails. I installed the more recent bdb instead. Oddly enough the ./configure summary still shows `-I/usr/local/Cellar/berkeley-db@4/4.8.30/include` under `CPPFLAGS` even though that directory doesn't exist. It results in warnings `ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/Cellar/berkeley-db@4/4.8.30/lib'`, but compilation otherwise seems happy.\r\n\r\nI think we agreed during the IRC meeting yesterday this isn't 0.17.0 release blocking.",
