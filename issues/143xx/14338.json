(Harding pointed out the below on IRC)\r\n```\r\nOh, maybe its just for parsing history backwards.  E.g. you're looking an the transactions\r\nsince block x and you want to get the block hash for x-1?\r\nDoing that in a single RPC call over calling getblockhash keeps it atomic so that you don't\r\nhave to worry about a reorg between the listsinceblock call and the getblockhash call, I\r\nguess.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt feels like it would make sense if this\r\n\r\n1. *did* filter out txs that were below the target\r\n2. *did* show txs that were below the target for arg 1 (blockhash), but were above the target for current block.\r\n\r\nThe above two changes would let someone create a simple starting point for only dealing with e.g. 6 confirmation transactions and not even have to bother with confirmation count since they'd never even see any transactions < target confs.\r\n\r\nIf not, the documentation is not very descriptive right now, and (despite having worked on the code for `listsinceblock` personally) I assumed things that weren't true about it, so it definitely needs a fix-up.\r\n",
