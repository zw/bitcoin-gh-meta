The output format is kept the same as before, though the input params change.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this has no test coverage, and I'm willing to bet it gets very little usage. The behavior is subtle and non-obvious: it does a real-time resolve in order to check whether an addnode entry is connected at the time of that resolve, and makes no mention of whether or not a connection once matched a resolved addnode.\r\n\r\nThis complicates the net encapsulation work, so I propose that we simply drop it unless there's a good reason not to. If preferred, it could swallow a dummy bool parameter, in order to remain api compatible.",
