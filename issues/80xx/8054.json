   "body" : "The current logic for syncing headers may lead to lots of duplicate `getheaders` requests being sent:  If a new block arrives while the node is in headers sync, it will send `getheaders` in response to the block announcement.  When the headers arrive, the message will be of maximum size and so a follow-up request will be sent---all of that in addition to the existing headers syncing.  This will create a second \"chain\" of `getheaders` requests.  If more blocks arrive, this may even lead to arbitrarily many parallel chains of redundant requests.  (See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6755.)\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the behaviour to only request more headers after a maximum-sized message when it contained at least one unknown header.  This avoids sustaining parallel chains of redundant requests.\r\n\r\nNote that this patch avoids the issues raised in the discussion of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6821:  There is no risk of the node being permanently blocked.  At the latest when a new block arrives this will trigger a new getheaders request and restart syncing.",
