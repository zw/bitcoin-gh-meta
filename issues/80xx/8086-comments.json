It orders peers by their netgroup and protects four, but it makes no effort to make the four be from different netgroups, which means there is an obvious attack strategy of running four hosts per netgroup in a lots of different netgroups. To avoid that, it should (e.g.) sort by netgroup hash, lastblocktime>0, connection uptime and skip over protecting peers that have the same netgroup as peers that were already protected.\r\n\r\nIt's more than a little disappointing to see furious hand-waving about the hash function when the basic functionality isn't getting anywhere near that amount of attention.",

I think SipHash is more appropriate, but SHA256 is certainly not inappropriate.\r\n\r\nSo let's just combine the approaches.\r\n\r\nI've included #8088 in this PR, and made a few more changes (= make the whole eviction logic work using nKeyedNetGroup, rather than only in the comparison). I've also made CNode::addr const (to make sure the precomputed keyed netgroup doesn't get invalidated) and moved the precomputation to the .cpp file.\r\n\r\n@theuni For combining with #8085, the CNode::CalculateKeyedNetGroup()'s k0 and k1 belong inside ConnMan, and perhaps the CNode::nKeyedNetGroup values do too (to prevent storing ConnMan-dependent information inside CNode).\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt I've expanded the comments in CSipHasher.",
