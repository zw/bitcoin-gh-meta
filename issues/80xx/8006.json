   "body" : "My changes leave all tray icon and menu creation/initialization logic untouched. It only shows or hides the icon according to the setting.\r\n\r\nA new checkbox was added to the OptionsDialog under the Window tab. A bool option named \"disableTray\" was added to OptionsModel. This checkbox was mapped like other all options to the OptionsModel.\r\n\r\nA signal was added to the OptionsModel for broadcasting changes the the\r\ndisableTray option. This signal was connected to a new slot added to\r\nBitcoinGUI named updateDisableTray(bool). The slot simply hides or shows\r\nthe trayIcon in BitcoinGUI according to the parameter recieved.\r\n\r\nThe negative wording of \"disableTray\" instead of a positive wording\r\n(\"enableTray\") because enabled is the default. Perhaps \"hideTray\" would\r\nbe better than disable.\r\n\r\nThis pull request intends to resolve this issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7160",
