   "body" : "Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically.\r\nhttps://stem.torproject.org/api/control.html#stem.control.Controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service\r\n\r\nThis means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), bitcoin could automatically create a hidden service to listen on, without user manual configuration. That would positively affect the number of available .onion nodes.\r\n\r\nThis would involve the following, if enabled:\r\n\r\n- When the node is started, connect to Tor through control socket\r\n- Send `create_ephemeral_hidden_service` command\r\n- First time:\r\n    - Make it create a hidden service key\r\n    - Save the key in the data directory for later usage (optional: Could also use a new key every time. Better for privacy, less so for having stable identifiers, so this should be configurable)\r\n- Make it redirect port 8333 to the local port 8333 (or whatever port we're listening on). E.g.\r\n```python\r\nresponse = controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service({8333: 8333}, key_type='NEW', key_content='BEST', await_publication = True)\r\n# Advertize <response.service_id>.onion\r\n# Optionally save response.private_key, response.private_key_type\r\n```\r\n- Keep control socket connection open for as long node is running. The hidden service will (by default) automatically go away when the connection is closed.\r\n\r\nChallenges:\r\n\r\n- Except for experimentation we probably don't want to rely on a Python script. This means the `create_ephemeral_hidden_service` STEM interface has to be implemented in C++. Internal command is `ADD_ONION`,  see https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/commit/?id=f5ff369 for the appropriate addition to torspec.\r\n\r\nEdit: the controller.create_ephemeral_hidden_service will take a while (I suppose the reason is that it needs to generate a key) - maybe execute it in a thread and not in the main initialization.\r\nEdit.2: FYI the part that takes significant time is not the key generation, but waiting for publication `await_publication = True`.",
