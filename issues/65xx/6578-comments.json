      "body" : "Note that since the last time NODE_BLOOM was proposed, the landcape for (lite-)SPV clients has changed significantly in a few key ways:\r\n\r\n1) @mikehearn's [Cartographer](https://github.com/mikehearn/httpseed) seed protocol has been created and deployed in production to allow (lite-)SPV clients to find nodes supporting arbitrary service bits, notable NODE_GETUTXOs.\r\n\r\n2) Bloom filter usage has declined significantly, as lite-SPV clients are moving towards using centralized, trusted, servers run by the wallet authors. For instance [Mycelium](https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet), [GreenBits](https://github.com/greenaddress/GreenBits), [AirBitz](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3etohn/whats_wrong_with_breadwallet/ctirou5), and [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) all fall in this category.\r\n\r\n3) Bloom filters [have been found](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/763) to have severe privacy issues, offering essentially no privacy at all. Under many threat models a small number of trusted servers pose less privacy security risk than connecting to random, sybil-attackable, peers using unencrypted connections and giving those peers very accurate wallet contents information.\r\n\r\n4) Finally, Bloom filters still have [unsolved DoS attack issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hjak7/the_hard_work_of_core_devs_not_xt_makes_bitcoin/cu9xntf?context=3), that will get significantly worse under upcoming blocksize increase proposals.\r\n\r\nRe: service bit identifier, I'd just pick 1<<3",

NODE_BLOOM just allows nodes to inform BIP37 clients that their response to certain P2P commands just isn't going to arrive. BitcoinJ already has a hardcoded HTTP seed which only gives out peers responding to NODE_GETUTXOS, I don't imagine there will be any problem adding a check there for another bit. \r\n\r\nUltimately wallets like Electrum or Mycelium ",
