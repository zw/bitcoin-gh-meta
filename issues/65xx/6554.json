   "body" : "While getting the python tests to run on windows I came across a problem of the test nodes sometimes not syncing.  I believe that's why the Travis builds were  failing when I submitted my pull request for enabling windows python tests.\r\n\r\nHere are the details as far as I can find.\r\nI have run these tests on Windows 7, both 32, 64 bit, with the current v11.0 and also the master branch all with the same results.\r\n\r\n1)   When I run the wallet.py test, the nodes will not sync I would say roughly 30% of the time. \r\n2)  They always fail at the same place, just after \"Have node1 generate 100 blocks (so node0 can recover the fee)\".\r\n3)  At this point one and sometimes two of the nodes will not sync their blocks\r\n4)  I can't do a network trace because wireshark will not trace on the loopback adapter on windows so all I have is the following from the log file shown below.\r\n\r\nOn the node that doesn't sync the only difference I can find in the logs is that just prior to the test\r\nfailing there is always the same messasge in the logs that is not present in the logs of the other nodes. The message begins with \"Reducing block download timeout\"\r\n\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 Reducing block download timeout for peer=1 block=6ebed8c2c5be6942028da47f1ddbb99405e856ad7c12b0207a8b4647962255fa, orig=1439480964263430 new=1439476464388230\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 Requesting block 5917b56ef19db11cc6ef2a6f44f026eab87f47bffb521d9402e119cfa289310d (172) peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 sending: getdata (37 bytes) peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 received: block (181 bytes) peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 received block 6ebed8c2c5be6942028da47f1ddbb99405e856ad7c12b0207a8b4647962255fa peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 Reducing block download timeout for peer=1 block=7c94201f537240a21e1b187c7f5ca96bb9a6d8f302de3961ddbaecf22dc3da19, orig=1439480964310230 new=1439476464403830\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 Requesting block 76ec7cee8ad99c8bdae67e2c651c6bb05fd5ec68787e45c21964bfb77c7bde8e (173) peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 sending: getdata (37 bytes) peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 received: block (181 bytes) peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 received block 7c94201f537240a21e1b187c7f5ca96bb9a6d8f302de3961ddbaecf22dc3da19 peer=1\r\n2015-08-13 14:14:24 Reducing block download timeout for peer=1 block=2d85186ef03a7bfdabca3363e085a373b36bf0fc6b3e9e1da252fce7004aad6b, orig=1439480964310230 new=1439476464435031\r\n",
