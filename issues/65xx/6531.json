Essentially, there is no tie-breaking mechanism in the transaction selection, and we end up picking essentially a random subset of transactions that have the same feePerKb. Current blocks/mempools contains  ton of transactions selected out of a pool of the same feePerKb set. I /think/ creating the heap with a tie-breaking mechanism of eg. the transaction hash should fix the issue, but it would need testing/more digging to confirm.\n",
