   "body" : "Before the first step #5696 (after creating an initial libconsensus and without counting checkpoints and Consensus::Params changes) gets negated (see #6526), here's a little second step towards completing libconsensus. This is also part of #5970 process of explicitly passing chainparams around, and in that sense it replaces #6024.\r\n\r\nThe function declarations are adapted and moved to consensus/consensus.h\r\nSince we're touching all declarations, it is diff-wise free to put them in the Consensus namespace at the same time. It also cherry picks one commit from #6526 (modified to rename CheckTransaction to Consensus::CheckTx [again, that rename is diff-wise free]).\r\n\r\nThe function definitions are left in main.cpp for now, but some of them will have to be moved to consensus/consensus.cpp before exposing anything else in libconsensus (my preference would be to expose VerifyHeader next, but I haven't got much feedback in that reward).\r\n\r\nBlocked by:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Blocksize: Turn MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and MAX_BLOCK_SIGOPS into functions #6625",
