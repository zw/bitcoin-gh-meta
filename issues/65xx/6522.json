Bitcoin v.0.11.0\r\n\r\nTo re-create this issue \r\n\r\n1)  create a new empty wallet\r\n2)  send 700 (yes 700) transactions to a single address in your new wallet from step 1.  In my test\r\nI sent 1500 satoshi's for each of the 700.\r\n3) From your new wallet send out a 2000 satoshi transaction and clck send (you will get the proper send confirmation dialog)\r\n4) Close the dialog and send another 50 transactions into your wallet. Now you should have 750 outputs in your wallet all under one single address.\r\n5) Now try to send the same 2000 satoshi transaction:  you will receive a \"Transaction too large\"  dialog.  Click OK on this and you will now receive the \"Transaction creation failed!\"  dialog.\r\n\r\nNote: if you use the coin control feature you can select a couple of the outputs and then send correctly it`s only when coin control is not used that this issue happens.\r\n",
