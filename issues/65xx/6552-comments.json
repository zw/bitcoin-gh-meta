What I'm trying to say is that I believe that bitcoin-tui should at least have a chance to be discussed on ideological level by the developers and not to be dismissed on a whim.",

But those niche groups who push for it are as important for the survival of the ecosystem as the big groups are; as those, most of the times, will be power users and developers themselves.",
