The latter shouldn't be possible given that `getaddressinfo` reports both addresses as ismine. Can you check if there is some transaction in your wallet that is spending that output but wasn't broadcast?\r\n\r\nIt could be that the output is locked with `lockunspent`, but that should only affect `listunspent` and not `getbalance`.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think it's possible to replicate this without having the private keys or even the wallet itself. Watchonly is a different set of conditions.\r\n\r\nCan you provide more details on how this wallet was constructed, e.g. were things imported?\r\n\r\nIf you import the privkeys into a new wallet, does it exhibit the same problem?",

That's a bug.\r\n\r\nThis did turn up a spending tx, but that tx was in the broader mempool because its parent didn't have sufficient feerate to enter common mempools (the spending tx is a CPFP fee-bump of an unrelated transaction):\r\n`listtransactions \"*\" 10000000 | jq '.[] | select(.confirmations <= 0) | .txid' | xargs -L1 ~/search-tx.sh | grep -C50 d49589ccd8488c56fbf12aee2652f760e1e84e6da1edd3dcf98bf6d556151396`\r\n```\r\ncat ~/search-tx.sh\r\nbitcoin-cli \"$1\" | jq '.hex' | tr -d '\"' | bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, were there package relay it would have broadcasted.\r\n\r\nFurther, the spending tx here is a send-from-self-to-self, which should be listed in balance/listunspent when I ask for 0-conf as the limit, AFAIU, or at least should have an option to, which is a second bug.",
