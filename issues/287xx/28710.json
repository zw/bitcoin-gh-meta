Migration of legacy wallets uses the independent BDB parser and a minimal `LegacyDataSPKM` that allows the legacy data to be loaded so that the migration can be completed.\r\n\r\nAll tests which tested legacy wallet behavior have been removed. The `--descriptors` and `--legacy-wallet` options are removed from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nBDB has been removed as a dependency and documentation have been updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nDepends on #26596",
