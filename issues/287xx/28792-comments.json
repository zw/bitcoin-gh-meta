      "body" : "A general question about this approach: do most contemporary OSes handle loading large amounts of (potentially) unused data into physical memory well-enough, that they would (likely) _not_ load this extra 1.5-3MB of data in the case that the `-asmap` is not being used? Perhaps this will be handled by the demand paging system? If not, it seems to be a bit of a shame to increase binary size by 20% in all cases.\r\n\r\nIt seems to make most sense to me to take the path suggested by @sipa, including the `.dat` file in the repo, and having it converted to a `.h` at compile time. It might also be nice to have a configuration flag to disable the embedded header creation for faster builds.",
