   "body" : "Right now a wallet descriptor is converted to its string representation (via `Descriptor::ToString`) repeatedly at different instances:\r\n- on finding a `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan` for a given descriptor (`CWallet::GetDescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`, e.g. used by the `importdescriptors` RPC); the string representation is created once for each spkm in the wallet and at each iteration again for the searched descriptor (`DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::HasWalletDescriptor`)\r\n- whenever `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::GetID()` is called, e.g. in `TopUp` or any instances where a descriptor is written to the DB to determine the database key, also at less obvious places like `FastWalletRescanFilter` etc.\r\n\r\nAs there is no good reason to calculate a fixed descriptor's string/ID more than once, add the ID as a field to `WalletDescriptor` and calculate it immediately at initialization (or deserialization). `HasWalletDescriptor` is changed to compare the spkm's and searched descriptor's ID instead of the string to take use of that.\r\n\r\nThis speeds up the functional test `wallet_miniscript.py` by a factor of 5-6x on my machine (3m30.95s on master vs. 0m38.02s on PR). The recently introduced \"max-size TapMiniscript\" test-case introduced a descriptor that takes 2-3 seconds to create a string representation, so the repeated calls to that were significantly hurting the performance.",
