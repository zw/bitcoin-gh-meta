      "body" : "You're running Bitcoin Core on a Raspberry Pi which can work with the right setup. Looks like you are storing blocks on an external drive of some kind, but the chainstate database might still be stored on the MicroSD card (?) and got corrupted.\r\n\r\nIt's a little hard to tell from your output what kind of external drive you have but assuming its a good quality SSD connected by USB3 to the Pi, you might consider mounting it directly to `/home/pi/.bitcoin` (this is what I do). Then all block, index, chainstate etc files are stored externally by default.\r\n\r\nOnce your configuration is improved you might try rebuilding the chainstate files with `-reindex-chainstate` which will NOT download the blockchain again, but will only work if those files (and their levelDB index) are not corrupted as well.",
