I don't think we're ready to start exposing a shared library with a stable API for core data structures, but the sufficiently encapsulated approach of \"Take a bunch of serialized structures, and compute something with it\" should be very safe. Libsecp256k1 uses the same approach by the way - none of the internal data structures are accessible through the public API. As the exposed functions are so simple, there's little reason to need a C++ api there.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I agree that the cache flag (and others in the future) dont make any sense to expose (hell, cache isnt even built in...), so I moved that one to script.h.\r\n\r\n@petertodd I agree, do you have any ideas for names that arent ridiculously long?",

We have no infrastructure for building shared libs there, so it's going to require a re-working of dependencies and build-scripts to get non-Linux platforms in place.\r\n\r\nOSX dylib builds, but it needed -lcrypto to link. key.cpp and script.h pull in some symbols. I'm not sure why Linux works, presumably the linker is smart enough to drop the unused paths. Windows needs a bunch of work.\r\n\r\nSo, NACK on anything but code movement until the aspects of building/distributing shared libs have been properly evaluated.
