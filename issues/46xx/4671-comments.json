      "body" : "Addition of seed.bitnodes.io was discussed and ACK'ed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875. This is part of getaddr.bitnodes.io infrastructure sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation and operated independently by myself. I believe most of the seeders are operated based on sipa's bitcoin seeder (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder). seed.bitnodes.io is based on a separate Python implementation available from https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes/blob/master/seeder.py. Nodes with most common height are selected on random basis and served via NSD authoritative-only DNS server. The seeder is currently hosted on a dedicated server by Hetzner in Germany and has been one of the most healthy according to http://bitcoinstats.com/network/dns-servers/. I'd be happy to provide more evidence if so required in order to continue the operation of the seeder.",
