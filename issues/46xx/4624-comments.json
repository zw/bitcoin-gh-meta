I suppose I could add another layer here, but I don't how you could get much more simple than this.\r\n* For a command line util, a shell script + statically prepared data output for cmp(1) is typically all you need.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am OK with adding some prepared python test driver if you have a favorite one pre-written.\r\n\r\nFor now, a simple shell 'for' loop that (1) executes a command line and (2) compares output with statically prepared output should cover a wide range of tests with one small shell script.\r\n",

Making a robust shell script that doesn't shoot you in the foot in unexpected conditions (which can be as mild as spaces in directory names) is harder then it seems. And don't forget the subtle differences between shells on different platforms. That's all a lot easier to get right with Python. Although granted, the case here is easier as there is no need to set up test nodes and kill them afterwards.\r\n\r\nI don't insist on converting it to Python, but it would be unfortunate to have the same realizations again with yet another built-in test framework.\r\n",
