   "body" : "The 'minrelaytxfee' option is described in the 'Fee filtering' section of the 0.13.0 release notes\r\n(https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/08/23/release-0.13.0) as\r\n\r\n> For several years now, Bitcoin Core nodes have used a minimum relay fee rate to help determine what unconfirmed transactions theyÃ¢ÂÂll process, relay, and store in their individual memory pools. Each node gets to decide its own minimum relay fee rate, and if they receive a transaction whose fee rate is below that limit, they donÃ¢ÂÂt add it to their memory pools or relay it to their other peers (although another mechanism called transaction priority historically allowed some transactions that pay a low fee to be accepted into mempools and relayed).\r\n\r\nThis makes it appear as a fully supported feature, however, it is listed under 'Debugging/Testing options' when the `--help` option is used, and there seems to be no dedicated regression test for it.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell it is used in abandonconflict.py, but its functionality is not specifically covered by any unit or regression tests.\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n\r\nYes, this applies to 0.13.0 release and 0.13.1 development (current 0.13 branch)\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. run `bitcoind --help`\r\n2. observe where the option 'minrelaytxfee' is listed \r\n3. inspect the tests under 'qa' and 'src/test'\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n- existence of at least a 'qa' test specifically covering the option (range of values, checking that it works as described)\r\n\r\n- listing of the option under some non-'Debugging/Testing' group such as 'Node relay options', 'Wallet options' or general 'Options'\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\n- 'minrelaytxfee' option is listed under 'Debugging/Testing options', suggesting it is experimental\r\n\r\n- 'minrelaytxfee' is used for a side effect in abandonconflict.py\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n\r\nOfficial 0.13.0 binary, as well as verified in source code of v0.13.0 tag (commit a402396dce64c42ea73535b7dde4a9164d430438) and current 0.13 branch commit 907c314057b09f1565840237b29a1bd607623ccd .",
