Any suggestion to advance in that front in this PR instead of  #9177 (which currently doesn't work and has one unittest that is not independent) would be welcomed.\r\n\r\nYou have recently made improvements in the rpc test framework, @MarcoFalke , and are familiar with it. If you get bored and can help fix one of the 3 tests that aren't passing for custom or just comment about the python changes in general, that would be great.\r\n\r\nREM:\r\n- The last 2 commits are not necessary, but anyone feel free to comment on them.\r\n- Except for p2p-compactblocks.py, segwit.py (and now p2p-segwit.py too) all rpc tests pass with \"custom\" too",

Every time a field is added or removed all calls would need to be adapted. Note that ideally, in the future, all tests would rely on CreateChainParams but none of them on the chainparams globals (accessed to via SelectParams and Params() ).\r\n\r\nAnother simpler option would be to simply let chainparams.cpp depend on globals mapArgs and mapMultiArgs (it depends on util.o anyway).\r\n\r\nYet another option is to undo some of that changes in #9243 if that gets merged first, which would be my personal preference.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has more options, I'm all ears.",

A way to introduce some randomness into the genesis block?\r\n\r\nIt allows you to create another chain with a different genesis block but with the exact same parameters on the rest. For example, let's say people create \"lightningtestnet\", then gets attacked and people just need to change the petname \"lightningtestnet2\" to coordinate another chain.\r\nIt can also be helpful for reading conf files if you maintain several, ie:\r\n\r\nlightningtest.conf\r\n```\r\nchain=custom\r\nchainpetname=lightningtest\r\n```\r\notherconfig.conf\r\n```\r\nchain=custom\r\nchainpetname=lightningtest2\r\n```\r\nBut this is less valuable since you can simple use the file name for that.\r\n\r\n> Also long-term what is the role of regtest in the functional test framework in your view since you're replacing it in most tests?\r\n\r\nI think we should consider removing it in the future (we would need to declare it deprecated first, or maybe we can rename custom to regtest and explain the genesis block for regtest changed), but note that after this segwit.py still uses regtest (presumably for its genesis block).\r\n",

      "body" : "Concept ACK. I like this idea. A few high-level thoughts:\r\n\r\n- it'd be nice if we could just move the functional tests across to exclusively use the custom chain. Then you wouldn't need to make the changes in test_framework to store and pass around the chain name. What are the problems with the `segwit.py` test that prevent you from doing that?\r\n- What do you think about simplifying the config model:\r\n    - change `-chain=` to take any string, where `main`, `test` and `regtest` are reserved and have special meaning. Any other value becomes the name of the custom chain (eg `custom` or `mychain` or `supereasydifficulty` or whatever).\r\n    - remove `chainconf`. The consensus config should always appear in `<chainname>_chain.conf`, so if I want to use a custom chain called \"lowdifficulty\", I set `-chain=lowdifficulty` and add a `lowdifficulty_chain.conf`\r\n    - drop the `chainpetname` parameter and add a `-consensus_genesiscoinbasetext` to the consensus parameters\r\n- this model could be extended to allow a `main_chain.conf`, which would allow only `consensus_assumevalid` to be updated. That would remove the global `hashAssumeValid` and put it back in CChainParams (can be done in a follow-up PR)\r\n\r\nCan you clean up the original PR notes so they describe exactly what's in this PR (they seem to have drifted a bit since you opened this)?",

On anything in the debug options at all, I was using -con_nsubsidyhalvinginterval just as an example to catch feedback like this. I think probably all the supported options should be shown or none of them. Which also opens the question of whether all options are worth it or not. For example,  -con_nsubsidyhalvinginterval may not be particularly interesting. I think activation logic for bip30 (via hardcoded block hash for bip34 activation), bip90, and bip9 are the most interesting (even though bip9 custom activation logic was already possible for regtest). Perhaps seeds or network magic makes sense too. I focused on implementing all the simple ones and documenting just one of them.\r\n ",

But this is a HF to regtest because it would change its genesis block, and people would need to remove their ./bitcoin/regtest directory. Would that be acceptable?\r\nWhich of the two options is preferred, hardfork for segwit or changing the python tests?\r\nThe former is both less code changes and less total code at the end.\r\n\r\nEDIT: another possibility is to do both and rename the new regtest to regtest2  ",

Yeah, I guess that could perhaps be useful and it's not compatible with committing those consensus chain params to the genesis block.

      "body" : "@MarcoFalke I honestly don't know what's the status of this at this point. I feel I asked too many question and I got too many different answers.\r\n\r\nThere's a few components here:\r\n\r\n1) regtest could make all its attributes configurable within its constructor. we already do this outside the constructor for bip9 and plan to do the same for segwitheight (there's older examples for trying to edit \"Params()\", but we want Params() to be immutable after init, at least for production. You can have your cake and it eat to as long as you make it in the constructor)\r\n2)  chainparams.cpp doesn't need any more classes even if we decide to add 10 new testnets, and -testnet, -regtest doesn't scale, there's should be just one -chain=<chainame> option and unless chainame is testnet3 or main, it should be just a configurable regtest which inclides the selected name in the hash of the genesis block (so if dumb miners chose to attack a testnet chain, let's say, lightningtestnet2, you just tell your friend testing on the same chain to change to -chain=lightningtestnet3 and replay all relevant txs).\r\n3) The python framework heavily assumes Params().strNetworkID == \"regtest\", that shouldn't be the case if chain=regtest is actually chain=<anything_except_main_and_testet3> . Combined with step 2, this could also serve to write tests to make sure that peers with incompatible consensus rules fork from each other as expected.\r\n\r\nI have no concerns in rebasing this forever (or until it's merged, obviously), but there's no harm in proposing and testing things one by one separatedly.\r\n\r\nAlthough I previously wanted to leave that for later, I suggest bip9 as an excuse to use gArgs/g_args from regtest's constructor (that's going to net remove a bunch of lines from init.cpp, so people may like it at a glance). Once people can do anything with regtest chainparams they may stop proposing to edit them on runtime, something I've been opposed to for years, but always comes back (see segwitheight).\r\n\r\nBut I think this PR in particular should be closed because maintaining the part about the simplest way of changing the genesis block into something that depends on <petname> and at the same time doesn't produce enough pow it's too expensive, at least expensive to maintain until there's even a more generic -chain=<petname> option other than -regtest.\r\n\r\nFinally, the qt part is just about having a different logo color for any other name (and put the name of the random chain in the title of the qt gui). I do care about he part of the custom petname being printed in the gui, I do not care about adding a new color, I'm fine reusing regtest color as long it's not bitcoin's or testnet3's. NACKs to specific commits or changes very welcomed too, or other logo default colors.\r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\n\r\nI mainly use this PR to monitor changes in chainparams or related or tests that may break changing the genesis block, petname (assuming there's a -chain=<petname> option)\r\nI will likely create a similar PR in the future, but the interesting part is, I think, feedback on the small parts that could be merged independently of my eternal \"altchainer vision\".\r\n\r\nWhich parts should be opened independently after closing this PR?\r\n",
