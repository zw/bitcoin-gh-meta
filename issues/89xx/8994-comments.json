Any suggestion to advance in that front in this PR instead of  #9177 (which currently doesn't work and has one unittest that is not independent) would be welcomed.\r\n\r\nYou have recently made improvements in the rpc test framework, @MarcoFalke , and are familiar with it. If you get bored and can help fix one of the 3 tests that aren't passing for custom or just comment about the python changes in general, that would be great.\r\n\r\nREM:\r\n- The last 2 commits are not necessary, but anyone feel free to comment on them.\r\n- Except for p2p-compactblocks.py, segwit.py (and now p2p-segwit.py too) all rpc tests pass with \"custom\" too",

Every time a field is added or removed all calls would need to be adapted. Note that ideally, in the future, all tests would rely on CreateChainParams but none of them on the chainparams globals (accessed to via SelectParams and Params() ).\r\n\r\nAnother simpler option would be to simply let chainparams.cpp depend on globals mapArgs and mapMultiArgs (it depends on util.o anyway).\r\n\r\nYet another option is to undo some of that changes in #9243 if that gets merged first, which would be my personal preference.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has more options, I'm all ears.",

A way to introduce some randomness into the genesis block?\r\n\r\nIt allows you to create another chain with a different genesis block but with the exact same parameters on the rest. For example, let's say people create \"lightningtestnet\", then gets attacked and people just need to change the petname \"lightningtestnet2\" to coordinate another chain.\r\nIt can also be helpful for reading conf files if you maintain several, ie:\r\n\r\nlightningtest.conf\r\n```\r\nchain=custom\r\nchainpetname=lightningtest\r\n```\r\notherconfig.conf\r\n```\r\nchain=custom\r\nchainpetname=lightningtest2\r\n```\r\nBut this is less valuable since you can simple use the file name for that.\r\n\r\n> Also long-term what is the role of regtest in the functional test framework in your view since you're replacing it in most tests?\r\n\r\nI think we should consider removing it in the future (we would need to declare it deprecated first, or maybe we can rename custom to regtest and explain the genesis block for regtest changed), but note that after this segwit.py still uses regtest (presumably for its genesis block).\r\n",

      "body" : "Concept ACK. I like this idea. A few high-level thoughts:\r\n\r\n- it'd be nice if we could just move the functional tests across to exclusively use the custom chain. Then you wouldn't need to make the changes in test_framework to store and pass around the chain name. What are the problems with the `segwit.py` test that prevent you from doing that?\r\n- What do you think about simplifying the config model:\r\n    - change `-chain=` to take any string, where `main`, `test` and `regtest` are reserved and have special meaning. Any other value becomes the name of the custom chain (eg `custom` or `mychain` or `supereasydifficulty` or whatever).\r\n    - remove `chainconf`. The consensus config should always appear in `<chainname>_chain.conf`, so if I want to use a custom chain called \"lowdifficulty\", I set `-chain=lowdifficulty` and add a `lowdifficulty_chain.conf`\r\n    - drop the `chainpetname` parameter and add a `-consensus_genesiscoinbasetext` to the consensus parameters\r\n- this model could be extended to allow a `main_chain.conf`, which would allow only `consensus_assumevalid` to be updated. That would remove the global `hashAssumeValid` and put it back in CChainParams (can be done in a follow-up PR)\r\n\r\nCan you clean up the original PR notes so they describe exactly what's in this PR (they seem to have drifted a bit since you opened this)?",

On anything in the debug options at all, I was using -con_nsubsidyhalvinginterval just as an example to catch feedback like this. I think probably all the supported options should be shown or none of them. Which also opens the question of whether all options are worth it or not. For example,  -con_nsubsidyhalvinginterval may not be particularly interesting. I think activation logic for bip30 (via hardcoded block hash for bip34 activation), bip90, and bip9 are the most interesting (even though bip9 custom activation logic was already possible for regtest). Perhaps seeds or network magic makes sense too. I focused on implementing all the simple ones and documenting just one of them.\r\n ",

I don't even understand why someone would want to use 2 different bech32_hrp on the same chain at different times...\r\n\r\n> It may actually be useful in tests to be able to change consensus rules on the fly without a new genesis block.\r\n\r\nI assume by \"on the fly\", you mean stopping the node and restarting it with different rules but the same genesis block and datadir. Yeah, I guess that could perhaps be useful and it's not compatible with committing those consensus chain params to the genesis block. Perhaps it makes sense to commit certain chainparams but not others.\r\n \r\n",
