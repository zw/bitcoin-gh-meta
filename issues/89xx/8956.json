   "body" : "As a modification of a suggestion from developer Rusty Russell, I suggest that testnet be hard-forked to allow anyone to spend any output older than N blocks, for some suitably large value of N like 26,208 blocks (nominally six months). This has at least three benefits:\n1. Ensures testnet coins never have value. If coins can be trivially obtained by 'stealing' old outputs, there is no scarcity from which economic value might originate.\n2. UTXO set reduction. There is presently no incentive for people to clean up their UTXOs after performing an experiment on testnet. It is good that the testnet block chain contains a record of all of these experiments, but it is not useful for the UTXO set to hold leftover outputs for perpetuity. All this does is increase the requirements of running a testnet node.\n3. Perpetual faucet. It would be easy to write an RPC that claimed funds from expired UTXOs, eliminating the need for faucets or the generosity of others to obtain funds. This is particularly a concern now that testnet mining is basically centralized and individual cpu miners are unable to get test coins from mining blocks..\n",
