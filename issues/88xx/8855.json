Although N is likely to remain 3 for the\r\nforeseeable future ~~(and not many people seemed interested in turning N\r\ninto infinite in #6382)~~ I believe segwit was an example on how starting a new testchain can be very useful and anything that makes that easier is potentially valuable.\r\n\r\nTraceability: Replaces #6907. \r\nChanges from final non-merged #6907:\r\n- [X] Of course, there were new uses of CChainParams& Params(std::string)\r\n- [X] post-segwit: UpdateRegtestBIP9Parameters is replaced with\r\n  UpdateBIP9Parameters since we don't have a separate global for\r\n  regtest anymore. An additional assert/error could be added if we\r\n  wanted to restrict its usage beyond regtest, bit I don't think the\r\n  restriction makes sense. Remember that Params() now returns a const ref and init.cpp was the only context was the only context where UpdateRegtestBIP9Parameters was called from.\r\n- [X] post-C++11: s/boost::scoped_ptr/std::unique_ptr/ as in #8629\r\n- [X] Return a std::unique_ptr<CChainParams> directly instead of a CChainParams*\r\n- [X] testChainParams could be confused as meaning params from testnet (changed to chainParams)\r\n- [X] Changes to checkpoint tests no longer required after #9053 ",
