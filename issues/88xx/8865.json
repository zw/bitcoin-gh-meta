Most of them arent much more intrusive than these, at least until there are large blocks of code moving.\r\n\r\nThis set focuses primarily on using CValidationinterface to handle peer-processing-logic updates when connecting/disconnecting blocks.\r\n\r\nI haven't significantly tested this as my normal test machine is largely unavailable atm, but most of the changes here are pretty straight-forward.",
