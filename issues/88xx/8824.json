The only part that can't be moved into bitcoin-common is parsing block contextual information (confirmations and blocktime), which are not available to bitcoin-common code.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be merged along with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8817 , which ensures that witness data gets returned from calls to TxToUniv()",
