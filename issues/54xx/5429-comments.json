Sometimes travis randomly builds out of order.\r\n- attempting to build the fastest first, when combined with fast-finish (which we use) means that github shows a failure much more quickly.\r\n- it may also be desirable to build the fast builds first in order to begin building subsequent PRs as quickly as possible. For example: pr1 is already building while pr2 is submitted. pr2 can start building as soon as there's a free slot. If we're attempting to have all builds finish at the same time, pr2 wouldn't start until ~all pr1 builds finished.\r\n\r\nThat said, I have no problem with trying different ordering strategies.",
