They all support minimize, but as a primarily OS X user, that's open for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Windows KB does have a [standard shortcuts](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/126449) list.\r\n> Microsoft Natural Keyboard keys\r\n* Windows Logo+M: Minimize all\r\n\r\nI believe the `Qt::CTRL` key on Windows represents the `Windows Logo`. But might be worth double checking.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli Presently the key advantage is the hotkey. OS X users tend to become extremely efficient using shortcuts, and the `Window` menu gives that feature a home. The `Show/Hide` features really don't make sense for Mac users and break workflow.\r\n\r\nI see this PR as being the foundation of other `Window` related actions. If you're a Mac user, I bet you have at least 10 apps open, so take a quick look what they have in their menu. Email clients and browsers are good examples. You'll likely find some useful navigation related actions, with hotkeys. I see this as being a usability, and accessibility win.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what to include for each platform, if the `Window` menu is approved, I guess it will require further discussion. Personally I see their being many actions that would be useful for Mac users, such as Ã¢ÂÂ+1, Ã¢ÂÂ+2, Ã¢ÂÂ+3, Ã¢ÂÂ+4 to jump between wallet tabs (just like browsers). However, some of these actions might be best suited to be platform specific.",

If you look at almost any application, Mac/Linux/Windows, they will have an Edit menu with cut CTRL + X, copy CTRL + C and paste CTRL + V (action + shortcut). There is also a long standing precedent that users can browse application menus when they are stuck, to find the right commands and actions. It makes little sense for shortcuts to exist without menu items.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that a menu with only one item adds limited value - but this is an initial commit aimed to get the ball rolling. The worst type of programming is pretending to know what's needed before you have first tested the waters. This is a case of easing in, and seeing what new value can be added. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think anyone has complained about the addition of the minimize hotkey; which to me suggests that it is indeed worth having.\r\n\r\nThe risk is that we add a main menubar item that remains relatively unused - which is an _extremely_ low risk. If it truly sucks, or doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make sense (for any or all platforms) in three months, just remove it. At the end of the day, this adds a commonly used action, to a menu that people who are looking for something will browse. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that in reality, most people don't know what 'hot corners' are, nor a lot of other fancy window management tools. They understand windows, menus and minimizing applications.",

      "body" : "I looked into making this a platform specific PR, as well as QT features for Mac. QT doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to natively support the `Zoom` feature, nor `Bring All to Front`. For reference, the QT Creator app source just toggles zoom between maximised and normal, and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt support `Bring All to Front`. Feel free to correct me if I missed something.\r\n\r\nThe `Zoom` action is meant to toggle between user selected window size, and one that optimally suits the window content (without scrollbars, if possible). It seems fairly redundant for the current app design.\r\n\r\nThe `Bring all to front` can be implemented, but it will be fragile to the addition of new windows with  a custom implementation. It would also require making decisions around sub-widgets layering, such as the debug window, command-line-options, edit label, etc.\r\n\r\nSo this ends up leaving the Window menu effectively empty (with only the Minimise action). However, there are other possible actions that make sense, such as actions to jump between tabs.\r\n\r\nWhile I think that there is decent room for improvement in the usability and accessibility features of Bitcoin Core, specifically for Mac, I feel that perhaps these efforts would have a greater impact on more user targeted wallet applications. I donÃ¢ÂÂt wish to take this PR any further - but others are welcome.",
