      "body" : "This feels like a hack fix to me, which might be OK... but eww.\r\n\r\nSo vWallet is memory-only, added to at startup and by AddToWallet, but transactions are never removed from it-- so performance will very slowly get worse until you restart. CWallet::SetBestChain could erase entries from vWallet...\r\n\r\nI think the best fix would be to change mapWallet into a boost::multi_index_container with two or three indices: by txid, by (spendable, nOrderPos), and maybe by (spendable, account, nOrderPos).\r\n\r\nThe tricky bit would be keeping the spendable bits up-to-date during blockchain re-orgs; extensive regression tests would be needed to make sure that isn't screwed up. If this pull request's \"ain't never gonna be a 100-block-long re-org\" assumption is OK, then a multi_index_container solution could have a similar definition of \"spendable\" and sidestep that work.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "Well, its for sure always much faster than what we have now. Looping through a vector is like 10 times faster than looping through a map. The vector can never have more entries than the map.\r\nAnd the vector endlessly growing if you dont restart, is not worse than looping through our whole map all the time, what we do now. So this is for sure an improvement regarding performance.\r\n\r\nBut I agree on little hacky, and that having just one multi_index_container would be cleaner.\r\nOn the other hand, the columns account, nOrderPos are not needed, if #4702 gets merged.\r\nAnd switching to multi_index_container just for one column spendable is not really worth it.\r\nMaybe even make our own class \"wallet-container\", which encapsulates the vector and the map with iterators etc.\r\n\r\nBut closing for now. Lets see, what happens to my other wallet pull requests, then I may reconsider this.",
