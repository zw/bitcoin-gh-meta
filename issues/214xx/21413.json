   "body" : "Draft because this depends on an open PR and I'm only looking for Concept ACKs for now.\r\n\r\nWith #20833, we can test transactions chains against validation rules + policy without broadcasting them. There was [discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20833#issuecomment-765057102) about how to make it useful by applications which have spending paths that require some delay (e.g. \"if Alice doesn't redeem, Bob can get the coins 144 blocks later\"). This PR implements a `test_accept`-only flag, `bypass_timelocks`, to skip `CheckFinalTx` and `CheckSequenceLocks`, i.e. that tx nLocktime and nSequence are ok based on the current block height/time. Script checks are still done as-is, so if the transaction itself has an error beyond not being final yet, it still fails.\r\n\r\nI've added a few lines here and there in the functional tests just to make sure it works as expected. If people think this is useful, I can write more tests from scratch.",
