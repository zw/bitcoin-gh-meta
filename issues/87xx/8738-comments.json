Bitcoin Core verifies simultaneously with downloading, avoiding the need for double storage and needing to wait for the download to complete before starting to validate. That verification can be sped up a lot if you can assign more memory to the database cache as @jonasschelli mentioned.\n\n10 days does sound extremely long though.

Perhaps a particular attack exists on the network that managed to interfere with your download process. Perhaps there is a bug in the download logic.

Furthermore,\nwe automatically select the best peers by continuously kicking off the\nslower ones. This mechanism seems to work very well in practice.\n\nThe expensive part of validation can only be done when you have the unspent\noutputs the transactions in that block depend on. Those are kept in a\ndatabase called the chainstate, and it depends on all previous blocks. It's\na reasonable suggestion to say we should do validation as soon as possible,\nbut please research how things work first.\n\nTo summarize:\n* If you want us to help investigate why synchronizing took 10 days, we\nwill need to know exactly what hardware and software you were using.\nGetting the contents of debug.log would be even more useful.\n* If you want to throw out suggestions on how to improve the downloading\nand validation, I really need to ask you to study how things work already.\nWe can't have a productive discussion otherwise.\n",

Surely if someone has the checksum of the data, and trusts this checksum, then this should be all that is required.\r\n\r\nTo put this in perspective, when downloading Bitcoin-QT, you expect downloaders to trust the checksum which has been signed by various developers. In the same way, a checksum should be all that is required to download the blockchain also. No further validation should be needed, based on the same level of trust.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that the hash of the latest block can be that checksum for the entire blockchain, and that if enough trusted sources agree on that hash, then it's overkill to do more. This is afterall, the same degree of security being used for the propagation of the bitcoin-qt binaries.\r\n\r\nAnd please, less of the \"this is not the place\" comments.

I think, given the way bitcoin binaries are distributed, that you are expecting people to trust the people who have signed the gitian compiled code. Therefore given trust is already being expected, we're just talking about extending it to another area that is also exploitable (by those trusted). i.e. anything trusted could be used to steal bitcoins, so the security is not weakened in any way, given that the trust is already being given. People can still chose whether or not to trust - trust should be optional. But it's already an option for the code - make it an option for the blockchain too.\r\n\r\nThere are already many places where people can check the latest block height, hash, etc. Perhaps even the outbound connections the average node makes (once addrman is fixed) would be sufficient validation to be sure that the correct checksum/hash is obtained - the user could be invited to make a manual further check - perhaps checking one or more of the numerous websites out there that publishes the latest block height and hash. I think most full-node operators would be comfortable doing this.",

      "body" : "@rebroad I am incredibly annoyed with your responses here.\n\nYou asked @jonasschnelli what verification he was talking about, claiming that it should just be some hashes being verified. I clarified that block validation is much more than just checking hashes, which lead us on a tangent where you start elaborating that people trust the code anyway so it doesn't matter. Of course, if you're not going to validate, then whatever Jonas was talking about does not matter anymore, right? In particular:\n\n> Perhaps even the outbound connections the average node makes (once addrman is fixed) would be sufficient validation to be sure that the correct checksum/hash is obtained\n\nmakes me think you shouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 10-foot pole. Your suggestion would allow anyone who can sybil attack you (your ISP? state level entities? anyone with enough resources to mount an eclipse attack?) to print money at will, doublespend at will, and pretend to have paid you any amount.\n\nElsewhere you stated it should be optional, and operators could check the end result on a website. I expect this would result in a world where in practice nearly everyone would trust the same few websites, creating a huge systemic risk.\n\nMaybe you were talking about the idea of not verifying blocks coming from trusted nodes? I can't follow anymore. In any case, that doesn't actually gain you much, as you'd still need to build the chainstate (which is a large part of the sync time on modern CPUs), even if you don't validate the scripts in it.\n\nPlease, use appropriate places and tone for discussions. A github issue about torrent-like downloading is not the right place to discuss\nfundamentally changing Bitcoin's security model - you only reach a few developers that way. And I think there are much more inviting ways to ask for clarification about this issue than \"Surely it should be enough to verify the the block hashes are correct\".\n",
