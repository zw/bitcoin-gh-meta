   "body" : "This is an alternative to #8755 and #8654\r\n\r\nThis implements a static estimation of sighash size for a transaction. A transaction with more than 90bytes of sighash per weight is non-standard. This is equivalent to 36MB for an 100kB non-segwit transaction, or 360MB for a block in the worst case. All existing standard transactions with legitimate use of `CHECK(MULTI)SIG` should remain standard with this limit.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of sighash is based on the assumption that `SignatureHash` is performed once only for each signature within a `CHECKMULTISIG`. This PR does not depend on any other policy or softforks like those in #8755. Despite the counting is more conservative, legitimate standard transactions for #8755 should also be standard in this implementation.\r\n\r\nTodo: unit tests",
