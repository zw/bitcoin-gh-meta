   "body" : "This is the full version with all debug added. It should help to make debug.log more concise and enable certain areas of interest to be {,de}activated.\r\n\r\nThis should help developers who need to enable debugging to determine what is happening allowing block and tx to be debugged individually.\r\n\r\nIt also could be of value to non-developers who simply want to get a better idea of what their full-node is doing - there have been a number of posts by non-developers wanting to see the \"parts moving\" so to speak, and I think this pull request can help with this.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is not an ego-commit, and I am not the only one who likes to see this stuff. It's made granular so that it can be configured via bitcoin.conf to hopefully suit most people. Some people like to see historical block download/upload, some only the propagation of blocks, some like to see how the code for tx handling is working, etc. I think it's rare that people want to see all of this at once - which was the only option available with debug=net.",
