   "body" : "Hello. This is more of an FYI than anything else. It's not a bug that needs to be fixed right away since Xcode 7.3.1's SDK can be extracted just fine.\r\n\r\nStarting with Xcode 8, Apple has moved over to a .xip file format. This is, AFAIK, a [ZIP file with a signature and some other metadata](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/242948/what-is-the-format-of-a-xip-file). This throws off the script in #8617 which is used to extract the SDK. 7-zip can still extract the contents. However, it extracts three files: *Content* (the actual content), *Metadata* (plist stuff wrapped in XML), and *[TOC].xml* (includes the signature, certificates, and other data, and lists where to find the data in the contents). If you try to extract anything from *Content*, the program will probably choke since there's metadata at the front of it (and the end too, I think). Offhand, I'm not aware of any Linux tools that support XIP files, even though it should be relatively trivial with *[TOC].xml* providing guidance. Apple has a *xip* binary that can extract but that's not a realistic solution, [even if it were open source](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/issues/821#issuecomment-242902676).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just wanted to bring this to everybody's attention. It might be worthwhile to add a note in the docs that people should stick to Xcode 7 for now. I'm happy to do that if it's okay.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
