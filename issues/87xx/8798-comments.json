So the above rule allows for (by default) 8 outgoing connections, 100 non-whitelisted incoming connections, and 12 reserved slots for whitelisted IPs.\n\n(This is largely untested.)\n",

Ideally I would like to see the feature where when a white connection comes in, an existing low-rating inbound connection is evicted to make room for it. This way it's simply a case of white connections having priority over other inbound connections, without needing to state how many slots to reserve.\n",
