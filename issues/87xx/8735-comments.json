I'm aware of the security weakness of accepting a xpriv over a startup argument.\r\nA previous proposed solution would be to support a tool called `bitcoin-wallet` which could create, alter and encrypt wallet without the need of bitcoind (this would by my preferred solution but can be added later).\r\n\r\nI think accepting a xpriv over a configuration value is not extremely bad. If an attacker can access bitcoin.conf he might also be capable of grabbing your RPC password and dump your wallet to /tmp.",
