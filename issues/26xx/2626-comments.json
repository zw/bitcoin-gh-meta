This is not so much a problem for the version notice itself, but if you refer them to that site to download a new version they will download a potentially infected client from the attacker. \r\n\r\nI remember some FinFisher scandal in which they pushed fake updates (to some software already on the user's computer) to install malware, so this threat is not hypothetical.  And even with SSL it would still be relying on a single point of failure...\r\n\r\nFor any auto-update, the client has to do the downloading + dev signature verification at least. Installation should be left to the user voluntarily (ie, \"this is the list of changes, click here if you want to upgrade\") .\r\n\r\nMaybe we could use a form of signing that does not require a complete GPG to be packaged? Or is there some lightweight library that allows verifying GPG signatures?\r\n",
