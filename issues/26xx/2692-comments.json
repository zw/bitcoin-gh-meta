Backups should be possible to internal storage (with warning) and/or external storage.\r\n\r\nInternal storage could be \"wallet.dat.backup20150101\" in the same directory or backups to user defined URIs on the \"local\" filesystem.\r\n\r\nNow to earn some critics: i would love the possibility to make a backup of my [encrypted!] wallet to my dropbox / google drive or other \"external space\".\r\nAt least it should be possible to use FTP/SFTP/S3 as external storage.\r\n\r\nbitcoind/Bitcoin-QT should give a nice interface to the available backups.\r\n\r\nFor hardcore bitcoind users it's might be needless.
