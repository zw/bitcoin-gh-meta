The reasoning behind it is that some people want to import their keys in a specific format to conform with either their previous format (keeping the same address between BitcoinQT and their other wallet that may or may not use compressed format), or maps to a specific vanity address they desire. The adoption of this option would encourage other wallet hosts and developers to do the same and encourage more people to use compressed keys (as opposed to uncompressed keys which are the norm at the moment since everyone else is using them).",
