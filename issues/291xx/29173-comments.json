What the software does and more importantly what the software doesn't do is the very role of software requirements. So first of all get the act together with best software practices. You have a descriptive argument called datacarriersize that doesn't really leave room for debate on what it is supposed to do. It isn't called scriptPubKeySize. However the behavior of this variable was changed without changing the name of the variable. Sneaky, well played. 6 years later Maria updates \"docs\" by updating the description of the argument. I'm calling out deception and incompetence where it is. Let the facts speak for themselves.\r\n",
