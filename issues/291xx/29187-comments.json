      "body" : "> * Identifying extra data yet removing the witness discount rather than filtering it out entirely. It's not clear this would be effective alone, but is supported by Knots v25.1.\r\n> * Adding a second `datacarriersize` with a broader scope like in [datacarriersize: Match more datacarryingÂ #28408](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408) ([suggested by glozow](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29187#issuecomment-1878972398)).\r\n\r\nTL;DR - My suggestion is to implement the bug fix as above with a combination of these two bullet points. ^\r\n\r\nIt seems like an acceptable compromise solution would be the combination of these two, provided that the default for the new second `otherdatacarriersize` option (or whatever it ends up being called) is the same as the existing one for OP_RETURN (80 bytes of arbitrary data), and there is an option to disable the equalization of the fees, if desired (as there is in Knots).\r\n\r\nThis fully addresses the only somewhat valid objection I saw to the original (now closed) PR, in my opinion, which was that there was no mechanism for users to run nodes which use the current policy if they so desired without code changes.  While I'm personally at a loss to why anyone would want to run a node that permits active exploitation of an obvious bug, I'm all for giving people choices.  Adding the options above resolves that objection entirely, as anyone with that mindset can simply set them to whatever they want.\r\n\r\nThis effectively adds OP_IF/OP_FALSE as a new \"tolerated\" method of data carrying, with a limit on data carrying equal to that of the existing tolerated method of OP_RETURN.  But keep in mind that the OP_FALSE/OP_IF exploit method of data carrying is arguably worse for the network than OP_RETURN, though, since these types of store-data-in-the-witness transactions require two transactions, and they tend to just leave a dust output in the UTXO set forever once the data is \"revealed\".  The above would disincentivize that harm sufficiently, since equalizing the fee-per-byte with OP_RETURN should effectively drive data carrying back to OP_RETURN (never enters the UTXO set) from a cost basis. This is because the two-transaction method of performing the OP_IF/OP_FALSE exploit would end up being more costly overall than one transaction to an OP_RETURN.\r\n\r\nFurther, any implementation of these new flags should be 100% unambiguous in documentation and comments such that they apply to all known data carrying methods besides OP_RETURN, and thus avoiding the potential situation where folks in the future can attempt to ignore an active exploit by simply changing the documentation.\r\n\r\nFinally, let's be clear that this is a valid issue, that the use of OP_FALSE/OP_IF for storing arbitrary data IS in fact an exploit, one that is being actively harmful, and fixing (or even slowing down, in the case of the suggested implementation above) that exploitation is in the best interest of the network as a whole. There is no script that actually validates anything that can make use of such a mechanism. It explicitly and provably does NOT use the arbitrary data for any validation whatsoever.  Any such method of storing data is clearly _not_ an intended use case for the Bitcoin network any more than someone storing arbitrary data in other types of outputs (like P2PKH, multisig, etc) is an intended and valid use case, as this is harmful to the network.  The latter was effectively discouraged by tolerating a small amount of arbitrary data with OP_RETURN, which is at least not _as_ harmful to the network.  While the existence of OP_RETURN doesn't prevent anyone from using more harmful methods, it does make them prohibitively more expensive to do so and seems to have all but eliminated that practice.\r\n\r\nThe OP_FALSE/OP_IF exploit gets around the clear intentions of allowing OP_RETURN by both avoiding the data size limit, AND getting a huge discount on fee per byte for that data compared to regular transactions. A clear bug to be addressed.  If, for example, people figured out a way to exploit OP_RETURN to get around the 80 byte relay limit when it was implemented, I'm certain there would have been a quick fix for that.  Also, if you have people constantly dumping garbage in your driveway that you have to clean up any time you want to move your car, and you decide to put in a security system to prevent that as best possible (maybe by making your neighbor's yard more attractive to the dumpers)... making the argument that the ones doing the dumping are now somehow the victims because they can no longer take advantage of you is just not valid.  The same goes for people actively exploiting a clear bug in Bitcoin. What happens with people actively exploiting it as a result of a fix that levels the playing field is not of consequence to users of Bitcoin. Heck, this proposal doesn't even prevent the practice, just puts it on par with other data carrying.  In my opinion, the exploit should be closed completely, but the two bullet points above are an excellent compromise.\r\n\r\nLet's get this fix done, and let's not let perfect be the enemy of good.",

      "body" : "> Since CVE ID is used to validate this as a vulnerability\r\n\r\nIt's not, really. In fact, I didn't even mention \"CVE\" once in [my detailed comment above](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29187#issuecomment-1879268385).\r\n\r\nThis is clearly a bug, clearly a vulnerability in the software, clearly unintended behavior, and clearly being actively exploited in the wild.  That _more_ than qualifies this particular issue as a valid CVE, but absolutely no one credible is doing the reverse of using the CVE ID's existence to \"validate this as a vulnerability.\"  It's an unambiguous vulnerability regardless of if it has a CVE number assigned to it.\r\n\r\n> I wanted to share that [cve.org](https://cve.org) has added \"disputed\" tag for CVE-2023-50428\r\n\r\nThe people actively exploiting a bug, or otherwise supporting the exploit of a bug, now _also_ abusing the mechanisms related to CVE reporting... is frankly unsurprising, and really doesn't qualify as something to be used as a \"gotcha\" here.  In fact, I think it gives the need to patch the exploit even _more_ weight, given how desperate the active exploiters are being in attempts to prevent this bug from being patched.\r\n\r\nThe ability to inject arbitrary data into _any_ system in a way that isn't explicitly documented as permitted for an expected purpose of the system is _always_ a vulnerability and _always_ something that should be addressed. This is cybersecurity 101 stuff, and isn't even remotely specific to Bitcoin.  The data proceeding OP_FALSE/OP_IF is clearly and provably arbitrary and not in any way required nor intended for Bitcoin to function as designed.\r\n\r\nStoring virtually limitless amounts of arbitrary data (effectively up to the max block size) in the Bitcoin public ledger (and thus forcing everyone running a full node to not only download and deal with this data, but requiring it to be stored for all eternity in one form or another) by using a clearly unintended exploit that gets around not only previously imposed limitations on tolerated arbitrary data size, but _also_ gets a _discount_ for doing so vs standard transactions?  That's got to be probably the most obvious exploit on the Bitcoin network since the infinite money exploit.  Fixing it shouldn't even be remotely controversial.\r\n\r\nIf someone can show me code, code comments, documentation, community discussion about the pros/cons of such a mechanism, and confirmation of \"rough consensus\" on this, from _before_ this exploit was developed and abused, that clearly defines this specific OP_FALSE/OP_IF method of storing arbitrary data in the Bitcoin blockchain as a well defined intended behavior that was agreed upon to be permitted by the community and nodes, then, I'd likely have to concede that this is not a vulnerability that needs fixing since it would then be clearly defined and intended behavior.  In the absence of that (which is the reality of the situation, because none of the above exists), this is unintended behavior, and a clear vulnerability that needs addressing.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is orders of magnitude worse than similar vulnerabilities in other systems that are clearly and unambiguously defined as a vulnerability and bug to be fixed.  The only reason this one is being disputed in any way, in my opinion, is because there's a massive conflict of interest and major financial incentive to the exploiters to retain their ability to abuse the Bitcoin network. So the full resources of those groups are being utilized to sow discord on what should be a cut and dry vulnerability patch.  Sadly, that's a _very_ noisy minority in this case.\r\n\r\n\"Bitcoin is a decentralized _digital currency_ that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network.\" By _finally_ addressing this issue (or heck, even acknowledging that it _is_ and issue), the developers would be upholding the primary purpose of the network, being a digital currency, thereby maintaining user trust in its reliability, long term viability, and overall security.  Fortunately some developers are capable of seeing through the noise here, and _hopefully_ other developers will regain their collective sanity and cut through the noise as well to properly address this bug. It's been quite the spectacle, and admittedly very disheartening, watching so many developers on this project whom I've held in pretty high regard over the years be so clearly and blatantly deceived and swayed by the obvious noise from attackers on this particular issue. That's been very sad to see.",

OP_RETURN was supposed to be the only tolerated way to do that.\r\n> \r\n> Can you add any references for this? because the GitHub and git history very clearly contradicts your statements ([#29187 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29187#issuecomment-1878972398)).\r\n\r\n\"There was [sic] been some confusion and misunderstanding in the community, regarding the OP_RETURN feature in 0.9 and data in the blockchain. This change is not an endorsement of storing data in the blockchain. The OP_RETURN change creates a provably-prunable output, to avoid data storage schemes â some of which were already deployed â that were storing arbitrary data such as images as forever-unspendable TX outputs, bloating bitcoinâs UTXO database.\" (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.9.0.md#op_return-and-data-in-the-block-chain)\r\n\r\nIf datacarriersize was meant to apply only to arbitrary data in op_return and not to all data, why wasn't it called op_returncarriersize?\r\n\r\nIts quite clear that op_return was meant to deprecate all other arbitrary data injection schemes, and it was then limited to 40 (later 80) bytes. The release notes history never show an intention to change the client to accommodate large amounts of arbitrary data either in relay policy or permanent storage in blockchain data.\r\n\r\nThis debate actually goes back quite a bit further, at least to v0.3. This size of op_return data was supposed to be limited to sha256 output (32 bytes), plus a few bytes for an identifier tag. This design choice was in compliance of Satoshi's suggestion \"I also support a third transaction type for timestamp hash sized arbitrary data.\" (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2162.msg28549#msg28549), At the time Satoshi wrote the above post signaling his support for 32 bytes of arbitrary data, Satoshi and Gavin (maybe others too) had agreed to implement a script whitelisting policy, which was an intentional effort to stop people from finding clever uses of script to create transactions which didn't relate to the monetary purpose of the client software.\r\n\r\nThe PR 28408 Review note posted by @glozow starts recording history from 0.10. I'm not sure why the incredibly relevant context about Bitcoin's design principles from 0.9 (and earlier) is being ignored.",

There will always be means available such as spreading the data over multiple outputs or multiple txs, encoding the data as arbitrary taproot scripts, or encoding the data as fake public keys or key hashes. Some of these encodings will be detectable while others will not.\r\nRaising the cost of inscriptions will reduce the amount of it, but it's not clear by how much. Doubling the cost could reduce it by half or reduce it by only by 10%. I don't know of any studies of the price sensitivity of inscribers. There is likely some degree of irrationality there.\r\nIt would be nice to see, for any proposed measure, what alternative encoding scheme(s) the inscribers can be expected to migrate to, on a cost minimization basis, and what implications that will have on things like full node resource usage, and whether we would be happy with that.",

There will always be means available such as spreading the data over multiple outputs or multiple txs, encoding the data as arbitrary taproot scripts, or encoding the data as fake public keys or key hashes. Some of these encodings will be detectable while others will not. Raising the cost of inscriptions will reduce the amount of it, but it's not clear by how much. Doubling the cost could reduce it by half or reduce it by only by 10%. I don't know of any studies of the price sensitivity of inscribers. There is likely some degree of irrationality there. It would be nice to see, for any proposed measure, what alternative encoding scheme(s) the inscribers can be expected to migrate to, on a cost minimization basis, and what implications that will have on things like full node resource usage, and whether we would be happy with that.\r\n\r\nRead the v0.9 release notes. We already had a debate about this and the community came to a consensus that the only legitimate inscription scheme was op_return, and it should be limited to 40 (or 80) bytes. Exploiting methods of inscribing data outside of op_return is antisocial behavior in violation of a broad agreement we used to have, which was never revised. Exploiting flaws in script should not be tolerated in this community, and especially not tolerated by the codebase.",

If you wanted to specifically target people using the segwit discount to store data cheaply in general, a better way would probably be to cap the segwit discount by some factor of the number of UTXOs the transaction consumes - say 500 bytes per consumed UTXO, to make some allowance for complex scripts. That way, transactions that use segwit \"properly\" would not be penalized, while transactions abusing it for data storage would pay ~4x the rate.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that this wouldn't actually address the blockchain spam we are currently seeing, which mostly consists of a large volume of BRC-20 tokens with negligible transaction size that, with some tweaking, could probably even fit in an `OP_RETURN`.",

I am confused? People who voiced objection in the previous thread appear largely to be ignoring this thread, since their points were already made.\n\nIn addition to the new context @1440000bytes has provided -- I want to make some points, just for the record (so it cannot be suggested that this thread lacks objections), since I detect a lot of emotion in some posts in this thread, combined with being apparently stuck in a previous era that no longer exists in Bitcoin, since the free market has clearly spoken and changed the game:\n\nBitcoin moves value* through time + space.\n\n*Value is subjective. (Value, in Bitcoin, is subjectively determined by the fee-rate of the tx.)\n\nBitcoin is a cypherpunk system. Bitcoin is based on crypto-anarchy. This is a colorful way of saying that Bitcoin is about freedom, including free markets.\n\nBitcoin's anti-DoS mechanism is not about Bitcoin Core sending political messages to dictate to the economy what it should or should not do.\n\nBitcoin's anti-DoS mechanism is based on fee-rate of txs.\n\nTherefore, there should be no prejudice on the mempool layer, as far as which kind of value is \"good\" or \"bad\", due to Bitcoin's primary ethos being dedicated to freedom, permissionlessness, and censorship-resistance.\n\nIn the case of arbitrary data txs, this is even more critical due to financial incentive. In 2023, the free market already voted in favor of arbitrary data txs, with a total of 8,500 BTC paid in fees by arbitrary data buyers of block space to sellers of block space, which was more than 1/3 of total fees.\n\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/11140618/feb639a8-4379-4f5d-ba82-841026127514)\n\nThus, any attempt to interfere carries obvious and severe risks and unintended consequences, for both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin:\n\n1. It sends a message that Bitcoin Core is being political, by trying to interfere in free market activity on the network by censoring valid fee-paying txs. It also would not dissuade activity, rather it would invigorate the arbitrary data economy due to being able to credibly claim censorship attempt. Permissionlessness quality means Bitcoin users do not require permission, not from Bitcoin Core nor from any other. Bitcoin operates on financial incentives of free markets. We have already seen in 2023 that the arbitrary data economy was only motivated by attempts to restrict their activity. It created a counter-culture that seemed \"cool\", in a rebellious \"stick it to the man\" sense.\n\n2. The update to Bitcoin Core is very likely ineffective, just virtue signaling (which Bitcoin Core should not be in the business of doing, as it makes a mockery of Bitcoin Core to implement changes that lack efficacy), since to change the public mempool relay situation, you would need iirc 85-92% of nodes to update. This is very low probability, as a significant minority or more of nodes simply refuse to update, and others wait years before updating. Also, users of arbitrary data obviously have an incentive to respond by running nodes without the change.\n\n3. Even if (2) is resolved in a low probability scenario, the arbitrary data economy can simply and quickly stop using the public mempool relay, and switch to miners' private mempool relay, by sending txs directly to miners. (Remember, there is a very strong financial incentive to route around any attempted censorship by Bitcoin Core.) This splits the mempool into 2 pieces: public and decentralized vs. private and centralized. Even if miners made their own mempool public at some point, it would need to be trusted, cannot verify, which incentivizes miners to lie about the real state of the mempool to increase fees paid. Nothing about this is good. It can cause pressure to centralize mining.\n\n4. ~~As explained by others in recent comments,~~ the arbitrary data can be easily switched to any number of different formats, with format chosen based on intended effect. It has various unintended consequences -- It would make already-created arbitrary data more valuable, as it makes their supply _finite_ if the old designs cannot be reused, this injects energy into the market instead of removing it. It can cause new designs to be more disruptive, not less. It creates an inevitable cat and mouse game, where Bitcoin Core must waste its precious time and energy and other resources on a pointless virtue-signaling exercise, and in fact vice-signaling by trying to censor fee-paying txs.\n\n5. re: UTXO set, various fear-mongering claims about the UTXO set are thrown around to artificially magnify the problem with scary words like \"bloat the UTXO set\" and \"increase RAM usage\", but these claims are false or misleading. -- As @achow101 said: \"With current usage, even with the bare multisig protocols, I don't think the effect on full nodes is particularly egregious. The UTXOs created for the arbitrary data are still small and bounded. I did a calculation a little while ago which suggested that the UTXO set growth due to bare multisigs is around a few MB. Compared to the rest of the UTXO set and the blockchain, that's nothing. All that means is that the storage required goes up by that amount. It doesn't have any effect on [RAM] memory usage, since there's a fixed amount of cache. If the UTXOs are never spent, then they won't be taking up any memory. -- @murchandamus has said: \"We load into the UTXO cache any UTXO that get referenced by transactions, and new UTXOs that get created. We flush the UTXO cache whenever it hits the limit, so UTXOs that havenât been used in a long time are likely not in the RAM.\" and \"By default, Bitcoin Core limits the mempool datastructure to 300 MiB of memory (RAM).\" and \"When this limit is hit, nodes start to discard the transactions with the lowest \"descendant set feerate\", i.e. the sum of fees divided by the sum of sizes of the transactions and its descendant transactions, until they are below the limit.\" -- @evoskuil has said: \"The only necessary difference is prunability, as both must be retained for bootstrapping. Yet widespread pruning also isnât good for bootstrapping, so really not an important distinction. Disk space is the cheapest computing resource. There is no good reason to be concerned about linear chain growth.\"\n\n6. Bitcoin's governance is not a democracy. It is not about who can vote more in favor vs. against, on Github. It is about achieving rough consensus, where the primary objective is the precautionary principle of \"do no harm\" (Bitcoin is a conservatively operated network, not \"move fast and break things\"), and thus where objections have to be properly addressed. If lack of consensus, then obviously no change.\n\n7. Bitcoin Core developers do not control Bitcoin. Users, businesses, miners, etc. choose which node implementation to run. If someone does not like Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core has no obligation to disregard its principles of (6), bow to pressure, and make changes. Bitcoin Core follows its principles and provides software to the market. It is a free market actor. The rest of the free market's actors then choose whether to accept that software, or fork it to create their own software to run.\n\n8. Uneconomic lower fee-rate txs that are priced out (by economically-viable higher fee-rate txs) are not entitled to be able to be made on L1 Bitcoin with its highest censorship-resistant assurances. L2 networks like LN exist to be able to handle txs with lower economic value (txs with lower fee-rate), by allowing to amortize the cost of the L1 fee across many L2 txs. Really low economic value txs like coffee payments arguably do not need L1's censorship resistance, and if for example they are not viable with L2 either due to fees, then arguably can use different layers: semi-decentralized federated networks like Liquid, or Fedimint, etc. Or, even non-decentralized custodial LN for coffee payments.\n\n9. The other realistic solution besides (8) is to focus on improving Bitcoin's L1 and L2 efficiency via consensus changes like CTV, for UTXO sharing to increase fee density and thus economic value of lower-value txs (to be better able to compete with higher-value economic txs), and to use CTV to be able to improve L2s like LN and Ark and Enigma.\n\n10. One other possible way to deal with arbitrary data txs, at its root, is to break Ordinal Theory, iiuc. This requires a fork, such as if Bitcoin implements Confidential Transactions. This too will need consensus, but it at least offers something valuable to many, in exchange for the lost fees: privacy (by default?) on L1 Bitcoin.\n\nI realize the truth is often unpopular, and truth is a bitter pill to swallow sometimes when it conflicts with one's ego, but nothing (not even ego) is more important than truth and reality.",

I am confused? People who voiced objection in the previous thread appear largely to be ignoring this thread, since their points were already made.\r\n\r\nEvery objection made both here and in the original PR was quite thoroughly and clearly debunked as not having any bearing whatsoever on the issue at hand.  The post above is no different, sadly, but unfortunately I don't have the patience to continue to combat such posts.  Thus far no one has made any valid arguments against anything I've posted above.  In fact, it's the people like myself with completely valid arguments with logical backing that are entirely ignored in this thread and others on the topic, drowned out by noise from people like yourself bringing up completely unrelated points that have nothing to do with the core issue at hand.\r\n\r\nAgain, don't have the patience to sit here and waste time invalidating every useless post, but let's go through some key points just to prove a point that should at least show that on the whole that such arguments have no merit here.\r\n \r\n> 1. It sends a message that Bitcoin Core is being political, by trying to interfere in free market activity on the network by censoring valid fee-paying txs.\r\n\r\nExploiting a bug in software is not \"interfering in free market activity.\"  It's fixing an unintended exploitable issue. Nothing more.  This is, again, this is cybersecurity 101 stuff.  From a code perspective, this is no different than the create-infinite bitcoin bug that was exploited and subsequently fixed.  An exploit is an exploit.  There was never consensus to allow discounted arbitrary data injection of limitless size into the blockchain.  Never.\r\n\r\nThis isn't political in any way.  It's just sane development practice.  Someone exploits a bug, you fix the bug.  You don't let the people exploiting the bug gaslight developers.\r\n\r\n> 2. The update to Bitcoin Core is very likely ineffective, just virtue signaling\r\n\r\nCompletely false.  IsStandard and other such mempool filtering has clearly been quite effective over the years.  Otherwise these spammers would just be using 1MB OP_RETURNs for their data.  The percentage of transactions that comply with IsStandard of the time period is a clear supermajority of transactions.\r\n\r\n> 3. Even if (2) is resolved in a low probability scenario, the arbitrary data economy can simply and quickly stop using the public mempool relay, and switch to miners' private mempool relay.\r\n\r\nAgain, this isn't supported by history nor is it viable on any real scale.\r\n\r\n> 4. As explained by others in recent comments, the arbitrary data can be easily switched to any number of different formats, with format chosen based on intended effect.\r\n\r\nYou're basically saying that as exploits are discovered, they shouldn't be patched and fixed... which is again, opposite of common sense in development.\r\n\r\nThere's always going to be people attempting to attack software like Bitcoin.  There _should_ also always be people fixing such issues.\r\n\r\nWhen developers stop caring about people exploiting, projects die.  That's the path we're on here, sadly, if we allow exploits to continue.\r\n\r\n> 5. re: UTXO set, various fear-mongering claims about the UTXO set are thrown around to artificially magnify the problem with scary words like \"bloat the UTXO set\" and \"increase RAM usage\", but these claims are false or misleading. [...]\r\n\r\nIt's not so much a matter of if people can absorb the costs of dealing with such an exploit.  It's that no one agreed to be exploited.  That's like saying it's ok for people to rob a store, because the store can afford it.  Neither situation is acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the exploit is borne by full nodes and archive nodes.  The miners being bribed to include such data with a broken policy that allows the exploit to continue are not the ones bearing the cost of the exploit. The cost is ongoing, and is non-zero. No matter how much that is downplayed, it's not what the code was intended to support.\r\n\r\n> 6. Bitcoin's governance is not a democracy.\r\n\r\nNot sure the relevance.  Has nothing to do with patching an exploit.\r\n\r\n> 7. Bitcoin Core developers do not control Bitcoin. Users, businesses, miners, etc. choose which node implementation to run.\r\n\r\nSadly, Bitcoin Core is the defacto \"standard\" for implementing Bitcoin.  Sure, people can and do run other implementations. But the majority blindly follow Core.\r\n\r\nThis isn't ideal, and I think it should change, but again... absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the issue at hand.\r\n\r\nThe code has a bug that is being exploited.\r\n\r\nIf users decide to run an alternative implementation that doesn't patch the bug, that's on them.  It doesn't have any bearing whatsoever on whether or not a cut and dry exploit should be fixed or not.\r\n\r\n> 8. Uneconomic lower fee-rate txs that are priced out (by economically-viable higher fee-rate txs) are not entitled to be able to be made on L1 Bitcoin with its highest censorship-resistant assurances.\r\n\r\nDiscussions on fees, again, are a non-sequitur.  How much someone pays to exploit a bug makes no difference whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf most-fees are the be-all-end-all of whether or not a bug is allowed to be actively exploited, then what happens if a bug is found that creates bitcoin out of thin air, and the exploiters just pay high fees when doing so? Or somehow override the block size limitation?  Or manage to exploit any number of other bugs yet-undiscovered? \"Well, they're valid transactions with high fees, so we'll allow it.\"  That's the argument being made here, and it's completely invalid.  It's horrible to even suggest such a precedent be set here.\r\n\r\n> 9. The other realistic solution besides (8) is to focus on improving Bitcoin's L1 and L2 efficiency via consensus changes like CTV, for UTXO sharing to increase fee density and thus economic value of lower-value txs (to be better able to compete with higher-value economic txs), and to use CTV to be able to improve L2s like LN and Ark and Enigma.\r\n\r\nImproving efficiency is good.  Doing this and fixing an exploit are no exclusive items.  Again, unrelated to the issue at hand.\r\n\r\n> 10. One other possible way to deal with arbitrary data txs, at its root, is to break Ordinal Theory, iiuc. This requires a fork, such as if Bitcoin implements Confidential Transactions. This too will need consensus, but it at least offers something valuable to many, in exchange for the lost fees: privacy (by default?) on L1 Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe entire concept of \"Ordinal Theory\" again, has nothing to do with the issue at hand... a recurring theme here.  Something made up by people exploiting a bug in the software to build on top of exploiting that bug doesn't negate the issue or have any bearing on the issue at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs is painfully obvious, there's no merit at all in any of the points presented as arguments for not patching an exploited bug.  Just a lot of non-sequitur info that's either completely unrelated, mean the exact opposite of what the poster actually intended as a \"gotcha\" (such as the point about alternate implementations above), or are easily disproven (IsStandard point above).\r\n\r\nAgain, I'd suggest folks read my original comments above.  It doesn't matter how much someone is willing to pay to exploit a bug.  That doesn't make it not a bug.\r\n\r\nAway from the technical for a moment, it's also crucial to highlight the broader risks associated with not addressing this exploit. The implications extend far beyond network inefficiencies; they venture into legal and ethical territories that could jeopardize the integrity and future of Bitcoin itself. By turning a blind eye to arbitrary data schemes, we're inviting some of the very problems we seek to avoid as Bitcoin supporters.  Additionally, failing to address obvious critical issues like this exploit undermines trust in the Bitcoin ecosystem, potentially driving away contributors and users who are vital to Bitcoin's growth and evolution.  Leaving an arbitrary data exploit like this unaddressed can and likely will hinder additional innovation and adoption. Instead of, for example, finding sane ways for people wanting to tie arbitrary data to the blockchain in a sensible way, allowing this exploit to go on unaddressed and unpatched sends the wrong message that the community simply won't act to protect the network, and there's no point in doing so.\r\n\r\nAs I revisit the unfolding events around this issue, a deep sense of disappointment takes hold. The situation is not just disheartening, it's a stark reminder of how even the most skilled and respected developers can be swayed. Many, whom I've held in high regard for their contributions over the years, now seem entangled in defending the exploitation of a bug. This shift, possibly influenced by economic incentives or just the sheer volume of noise and relentless arguments from those profiting from the exploit, is a troubling development.\r\n\r\nThe fact that fixing this exploit is not only being ignored by, but getting active push back from the same developers, should be enough to give everyone in the Bitcoin community pause.",

It is not.\r\n\r\nWhether or not stuffing arbitrary data between valid opcodes is currently treated as \"working\" or not by current code isn't the issue.  There's no documented intention that a loophole be created to permit copious amounts of fee-discounted arbitrary data be injected into a transaction.  I see _zero_ documentation in the code nor links provided that expresses the use case (OP_FALSE,OP_IF,DATA) as a valid method for storing arbitrary data.\r\n\r\nAgain, let's be clear: Cybersecurity 101 stuff here. The ability to inject arbitrary data into any system in a way that isn't explicitly documented as permitted for an expected purpose of the system is always a vulnerability and always something that should be addressed.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one such permitted method, which is documented in both of the links you posted (OP_RETURN), with a sane limitation on its use.  But again, you already knew that.\r\n\r\n> If you want to add another config option for certain transaction that are considered \"spam\" by a few users, why not open a pull request that allows users to do it without changing defaults?\r\n\r\nShould we add a config option for other bug fixes as well?  Last I checked there wasn't a \"disableinfinitemoneyglitch\" option that was disabled by default.  Bug fixes in code that bring things back to intended operation are just patched in, with no option to disable them.\r\n\r\nThe only reason anyone's even considering making this an option at all, vs just patching like it rightfully should be from a development standpoint, is because of the noise involved from folks exploiting and supporting the exploiting.\r\n\r\nFlipping your question then, why not add fixing the exploit as a default option and let anyone wanting to mine transactions that exploit the bug enable it explicitly?  Seems fixing an exploit is the sane approach, and if other's then make a use case for enabling it on their nodes, that's up to them. The community as a whole shouldn't be running code that is exploitable by known methods.\r\n\r\n> I have suggested 2 approaches. Some developers suggested their preferred approach in recent meeting: https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2024-01-11#998497\r\n\r\nThat meeting was completely pointless (as you may have noticed, I was \"there\").  There was zero opportunity to actually discuss the issue, address concerns, find a path forward that was potentially acceptable, and doesn't waste developer time. It was just brushed under the rug as quickly as possible.  Complete waste of time.  Had the same vibes as people bringing up completely sane points at a town hall meeting, only to have the politicians in charge completely ignore the issues presented and press onward. Disgusting, IMO, especially from the development community.",

Will that need a CVE ID?\r\n\r\nYou're clearly using a bit of hyperbole here, again in yet another attempt at a \"gotcha\" moment without addressing _anything_ already rebutted previously.... but, regardless, I suppose such an exploit could have had a CVE assigned if something like that had been exploited and/or discovered as an issue before OP_RETURN was made available as standard. If there wasn't anything being done to address the issue then sure, I guess it could've gotten a CVE.  But, the developers _did_ act to prevent harmful data stuffing schemes with the tolerated limited OP_RETURN data carrying becoming standard, which made using such methods pointless.\r\n\r\nThe scope of harm a bad actor would be capable of inflicting upon the network with such a silly encoding method is extremely limited.  Many orders of magnitude less severe than the actively exploited OP_FALSE/OP_IF issue.\r\n\r\nOP_RETURN exists and tolerates up to 640-bits of arbitrary data per transaction as standard.  This is the mitigation for people encoding arbitrary data in other types of fields and overrides any need for stashing arbitrary data in other areas that would be less efficient than just using OP_RETURN.\r\n\r\nStoring data in nLockTime is not happening as it's not really even exploitable.  32-bits max, but far less in practice, since would need to be a value permitted to be included in a block... so maybe 27 bits or so max per transaction?  Just use OP_RETURN.  Cheaper and more efficient.\r\n\r\nStore data in _amounts_ is convoluted since you'd need a significant amount of bitcoin to be able to encode anything of a useful length. Again... just use OP_RETURN.  Cheaper and more efficient.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the purpose of making 40 then 80 byte OP_RETURN standard. It was the exploit bandage for such inefficient and harmful data carrying schemes, and addressed the issue sufficiently.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if someone _were_ to use some method of storing data in nLockTime/amounts, presumably there would need to be a way to differentiate this arbitrary data from a normal transaction in order to extract the data and for it to be useful for the exploiter... in which case once known, the network (and thus developers here) _should_ enforce sane limits on the data carrying practice like any other known data carrying method to prevent its exploitation to the best of our ability and prevent harm to the network.  If that wasn't happening, then sure maybe it should get a CVE.  I'd support that, despite how unlikely such a situation really is.\r\n\r\nAgain, there's no real reason to use such inefficient methods of data carrying, since OP_RETURN up to a sensible limit is available and tolerated as standard.  So, that's a bit contrived and a non-issue in the real world.\r\n\r\nFinally, keep in mind I've noted that the CVE's existence for the OP_FALSE/OP_IF exploit, nor its status have anything to do with whether or not the bug is in fact a vulnerability that's being actively exploited.  It's clearly by definition a vulnerability, and even more critical to address since it's being actively exploited in the wild.",
