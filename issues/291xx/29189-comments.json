      "body" : "Thank you, @1thales, for the ping.\r\n\r\nI'm building a lightweight Bitcoin full node called [Floresta](https://github.com/Davidson-Souza/Floresta), and I'm using `libbitcoinconsensus` through `rust-bitcoinconsensus`. I would rather not reimplement the entire script interpreter logic, given the complexity of keeping this code consensus-compatible with core. I did reimplement some consensus logic, but tx validation and script interpreter are the hardest ones to. `libbitcoinconsensus` has some issues, for example `libbitcoinconsensus` doesn't validate relative locktimes like `CSV`. I would prefer validating everything, including those.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I've exchanged some emails with @TheCharlatan about `libbitcoinkernel`, which is a great project. However, as it is, can't be used by `Floresta` because it relies on core's block-storage and `leveldb`. Since `floresta` is built using `utreexo`, we can't need those. \r\n\r\nIf `libbitcoinkernel` exposes stateless block/tx validation, that is, I give the transaction[s], the inputs and some context like block hash and MTP, and it spits out a \"valid\" or \"not valid because X\"; I would start using it as replacement without problems.\r\n",

Isn't it better to document it as deprecated now and later remove the library and its tests at the same time?",

I think that means we will still be building the library by default but not testing it? That seems a bit odd to me, and I would rather that testing is deleted at the same time the library is removed, unless there is some reason that those tests can be removed that is unrelated to the deprecation.\r\n\r\nIf we do deprecate this, then all downstream users need to be made aware that it is going away and that they have a plan to move away from it. I don't like leaving our users out to dry.\r\n\r\nFor 27.0 specifically, I think this needs a release note. Release notes at least have some expectation of being read regularly, so a deprecation notice in there would be beneficial.
