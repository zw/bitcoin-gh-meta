   "body" : "This has outlived its usefulness, doesn't gel well with newer compilers & `-flto` related options, i.e thin vs full, or `=auto`, and having `-flto` as the only option means that sometimes this just needs to be worked around, i.e in oss-fuzz:\r\nhttps://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/bitcoin-core/build.sh.\r\n\r\nWhile it was convenient when `-flto` was newer, support for `-flto` is now in all compilers we use, and there's also no-longer any real need for us to treat `-flto` different to any other optimization option.\r\n\r\nRemove it, to remove build complexity, and so there's no need to port a similar option to CMake.\r\n\r\nNote that the LTO option remains in depends, because we still need a way to build packages that have LTO specific patches/options.",
