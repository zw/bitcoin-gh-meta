So, I believe being very critical and clear with the handling will be better for the following reasons:\r\n> \r\n> 1. For crucial backend software, such as bitcoind, it seems negligent to not properly inform the user that their settings file has been lost to corruption.\r\n> 2. It seems to me that a regular user won't tinker with their settings file regularly, so any kind of auto-generated message in the settings.json file loses its relevance there.\r\n> 3. Finally, say a user sets some custom settings once and later loses the settings to corruption (=> file now empty); it seems an improper approach to me for bitcoind to return to default settings without any kind of proper log or error to the user.\r\n> \r\n> Also, a gentle ping to @ryanofsky to confirm if my interpretation of the situation is correct, and also to get his take on this PR.\r\n\r\nThere is no discussion over that. I agreed with all previous arguments against the current implementation since my first comment on this PR. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29144#pullrequestreview-1797199209.\r\n\r\nThus I proposed a different solution for non-interactive users who are manually modifying the file. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29144#pullrequestreview-1798109497.\r\nStating that the file is JSON-formatted and auto-generated gives bitcoind users another hint over what they can and can't do.\r\n\r\n\r\n> > It would probably be useful to introduce support for comments. This way, we can write something at the beginning of the file, ensuring that users and other software developers don't clean it up manually, thinking that it will be regenerated automatically.\r\n> \r\n> This will not help if cause was full disk. [#21340 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21340#issuecomment-876779561)\r\n\r\nThats a different problematic @kristapsk. The comments support feature goal is to prevent users', and/or other third party softwares, manual mistakes. Not OS level corruption issues.",

      "body" : "re: 725a1fc7a7dbb1153bec188eda2f17a217560352 I think it is important to treat an empty settings file as an error, because the most likely cause of an empty file is some kind of crash or corruption or disk full state, and it is safer to alert the user about the situation so they can fix it, than proceed as if the error didn't happen and lose important settings that could affect security or stability.\r\n\r\nI think the error message \"Unable to parse settings file %s\" could definitely be improved though. Would suggest maybe \"Settings file %s does not contain valid JSON. This is probably caused by disk corruption or a crash, and can be fixed by removing the file, which will reset settings to default values.\" This would probably work OK for both command line and GUI (since the GUI already offers the option to reset the settings see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/379).\r\n\r\nAs far as adding a comments to the settings file, I'm not sure it would necessarily help in the reported case from https://community.umbrel.com/t/bitcoin-docker-container-keeps-restarting/2144, but it probably depends on whatever caused the settings file to be truncated or created empty in that case, and it could be a good idea to add comments to the file regardless. JSON doesn't have a syntax for comments, it but would be possible to add an extra field like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_comment_\": \"This file is automatically generated and updated by Bitcoin Core. Please do not edit this file while the node is running, as any changes might be ignored or overwritten.\"\r\n}\r\n```",

      "body" : "> I think the error message \"Unable to parse settings file %s\" could definitely be improved though. Would suggest maybe \"Settings file %s does not contain valid JSON. This is probably caused by disk corruption or a crash, and can be fixed by removing the file, which will reset settings to default values.\" This would probably work OK for both command line and GUI (since the GUI already offers the option to reset the settings see [bitcoin-core/gui#379](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/379)).\r\n> \r\n> As far as adding a comments to the settings file, I'm not sure it would necessarily help in the reported case from https://community.umbrel.com/t/bitcoin-docker-container-keeps-restarting/2144, but it probably depends on whatever caused the settings file to be truncated or created empty in that case, and it could be a good idea to add comments to the file regardless. JSON doesn't have a syntax for comments, it but would be possible to add an extra field like:\r\n> \r\n> ```json\r\n> {\r\n>   \"_comment_\": \"This file is automatically generated and updated by Bitcoin Core. Please do not edit this file while the node is running, as any changes might be ignored or overwritten.\"\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nSounds great. Thanks @ryanofsky!\r\nUpdated per feedback.",
