   "body" : "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29109#issuecomment-1863449058 reports that a wallet with noncritical errors cannot be dumped with `bitcoin-wallet dump`. This was caused by an erroneous reset of the wallet pointer when the loading the wallet returns something other than `LOAD_OK`. Not all errors are errors that require aborting, so unilaterally resetting the pointer at that time is incorrect. The first commit resolves this issue.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if a wallet has loading errors, that should not prevent the wallet tool from dumping the wallet. The wallet application logic should not get in the way of performing such a low level database operation, especially when it's primary usage is for debugging potentially corrupted wallets. The 2nd commit is taken from #28710 and changes the `dump` to stop at making a `WalletDatabase` rather than making a `CWallet` only to retrieve the underlying `WalletDatabase`.",
