   "body" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nAfter a clean shutdown, bitcoind failed to load the majority of mempool transactions from mempool.dat. I keep a node up for months for webpage mempoolexplorer.com with options:\r\nmaxmempool=2000\r\nmempoolfullrbf=1\r\nmempoolexpiry=999999\r\nto maximize the number of txs in my mempool.\r\nThe node is currently loading and saving mempool txs when shutdown ok (but with only a small number of them instead of a fully synchronized mempool). So I think It could be related to the currently mempool size spike. (larger than ever according [jochen-hoenicke](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,all,weight) )\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe expected behavior is to save/load all the transactions again no matter the size of the mempool\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIt's a issue difficult to reproduce, because I have no access to a node syncronized with \"the full mempool\" since mine failed.\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce the issue you must have access to a big mempool and try to start/stop bitcoind and monitor mempool.dat. (Mine is currenty erased and only with a few transactions)\r\n\r\nNot sure if the problem was writing the txs into mempool.dat or reading them.\r\n\r\nMaybe this utility I created can help copying a live mempool from one node to another:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dev7ba/mempoolcp\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nI did not copy the debug.log line (currently erased) but it was something like this:\r\n\r\nImported mempool transactions from disk: (small number here) succeeded, (big number here) failed, 0 expired, 0 already there, 0 waiting for initial broadcast\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv24.0.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 20.04.6 LTS\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-6260U CPU @ 1.80GHz 16GB RAM",
