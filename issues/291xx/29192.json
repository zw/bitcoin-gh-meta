   "body" : "Closes #28941.\r\n\r\nOur current tests for serfloat verify two distinct properties:\r\n1. Whether they roundtrip `double`->`uint64_t`->`double` (excluding NaN values) on all systems.\r\n2. Whether on systems with a typical floating point unit that encoding matches the hardware representation, as before v22.0, we would dump the hardware representation directly to disk and we wanted to retain compatibility with that.\r\n\r\n#28941 seems to show that the second property doesn't always hold, but just for \"subnormal\" numbers (below $2^{-1021}$). Since we don't care about encoding these numbers, we could exclude such subnormal numbers from the hardware-identical representation test, but this PR goes further and just drops the second property entirely, as I don't think we care about edge-case compatibility with pre-v22.0 code for fee_estimates.dat (the only place it is used).",
