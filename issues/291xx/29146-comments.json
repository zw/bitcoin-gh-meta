      "body" : "> Yes it takes more bytes to spend a transaction than to split a transaction because input consumption includes signatures (witness data) and outputs typically contain only P2SH which is compact. So the discount balances those input consumption bytes and output creation bytes so there is no longer a financial incentive to create dust. To be sure if you run out of coins your wallet will use change, but until then it will keep splitting coins. Say you have 100 1BTC lumps in your wallet for privacy, and you make 100 < 1BTC payment your wallet will correctly minimise fees by splitting all 1BTC payments and creating 100 change coins. That is bad for UTXO bloat. With the incentive fix depending on what amounts you're paying the UTXO bloat will be much smaller. A negative economic externality is saying someone else, or everyone is paying for your actions because you are not exposed to their cost. That is what is happening today with change.\r\n- Adam Back, 3-Apr-2016, https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4d3pdg/comment/d1nxn28/\r\n\r\n> The primary idea behind the discounts are to incentivise wallets to manage change differently and clean up the UTXO set.
