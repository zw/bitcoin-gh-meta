      "body" : "There is literally no way for macOS to tell the difference between a signed-but-not-notarized app, and a signed-and-notorized-but-not-stapled app. They are bit-for-bit identical. The way macOS tells if it is notarized, if the notarization is not stapled, is that it phones home and asks.\r\n\r\nApparently @jonasschnelli ran some experiment in which he used Wireshark to test under what circumstances the gatekeeper phones home. However his description of the experiment he ran was on his own website, and that page is now down (with no mirror in the internet archive that I can find). I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm struggling to understand by what mechanism macOS would know the app bundle is not notarized without phoning home. The only possibility I can see is that the gatekeeper checks if the linked libraries are non-hardened, and doesn't bother continuing on with notarization checks if that is the case. That would be reasonable, except then why does the notarization tool which does local gatekeeper validation checks, not also complain before sending a non-hardened binary to the Apple server? It has to wait for the server-side check to know that it is unsuitable for notorization.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else checked if their system is calling Apple's gatekeeper servers when a bitcoin core binary is downloaded for the very first time? I don't mean to cast shade as if so it was clearly an accident, but I wonder if the experimental setup had the binary getting checked outside the window in which Jonas was testing with Wireshark. That would explain the results as macOS gatekeeper is known to cache notary results (it won't keep checking files that failed). Unfortunately his writeup of what he tried has not been preserved.",
