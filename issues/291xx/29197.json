   "body" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nSimilar to signature types, I2P supports multiple encryption types.\r\nSAM defaults to the oldest type for both, for backward compatibility.\r\nUnfortunately I forgot about this for encryption types.\r\n\r\nThe qbittorrent / libtorrent projects just discovered encryption types\r\nin this issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/19625\r\n\r\nThe encryption type is a property of the session, not the destination.\r\nSessions may support multiple types.\r\nYou may only connect to a destination if both sides have sessions\r\nwith a common encryption type.\r\n\r\nAs you are not setting the encryption type, you are using ElGamal (type 0).\r\nYou should change that to use both ElGamal and ECIES-X25519 (types 0 and 4).\r\nThe newer, faster type will be preferred.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nTo fix, in i2p.cpp, add the config in two places (SESSION CREATE for both transient and fixed):\r\n\r\ni2cp.leaseSetEncType=4,0\r\n\r\nas in this patch for libtorrent:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/19625#issuecomment-1879582395\r\n\r\nThis will allow you to connect to clients with either type.\r\nAt some point a year in the future, after everybody has upgraded, you can\r\nchange it to i2cp.leaseSetEncType=4 if you like.\r\n\r\nNote that i2pd has a bug where they do not report immediate failure\r\nif trying to connect to an incompatible destination;\r\nthat issue is https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/issues/2004\r\nbut you will not hit this issue because your old clients (0) can talk to new ones (4,0).\r\n\r\nI have updated our SAM doc with these recommendations: https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn the java i2p console,\r\nyou can verify the leaseset types on the client leasesets netdb tab\r\nif you have routerconsole.advanced=true in router.config.\r\n\r\nIn the i2pd console, it reports the actual encryption type used,\r\nunder LeaseSets for a particular destination.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n5xeoyfvtddmo5k3kxzv7b3d5risil6333ntqrr3yvx3yubz5tk3a â 3 4\r\n\r\nthe last number 4 is the encryption type selected.\r\nIf you have any questions on where to look in the i2pd console please ask @orignal.\r\n\r\nRecommended testing: Test with both i2pd and Java I2P, and confirm that you can connect\r\nbetween all combinations of new (4,0) and old (0) clients.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv26\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nall\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
