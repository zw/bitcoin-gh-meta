   "body" : "It is sometimes useful for the wallet to have keys that it can sign with but are not (initially) involved in any scripts, e.g. for setting up a multisig. Ryanofsky [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1867721948) A `void(KEY)` descriptor which allows for a key to be specified, but produces no scripts. These can be imported into the wallet, and subsequently retrieved with `gethdkeys`. Additionally, `listdescriptors` will output these descriptors so that they can be easily backed up.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to add HD keys to their wallet, and to generate a new one if they want to rotate their descriptors, an `addhdkey` RPC is also added. Without arguments, it will generate a new HD key and add it to the wallet via a `void(KEY)` descriptor. If provided a private key, it will construct the descriptor and add it to the wallet.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1866961865\r\n\r\nBased on #29130 as `gethdkeys` is useful for testing this.",
