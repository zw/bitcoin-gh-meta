It's also possible to open a pull request against your own repo-fork of Bitcoin Core, or Inquisition as suggested above.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of a well defined process for making changes to bitcoin consensus (nor do I think there should be one), so I'm not sure how we can be too early in the process.\r\n\r\nCTV had (a  year of?) workshops and review with Jeremy Rubin about 2 years ago. OP_INTERNALKEY is a binary in terms of the concept - either we're OK with it or we're not, no discussion, so no reason to delay the code review. CSFS does have a few points that could be discussed (and weren't discussed years ago on the mailing list because Taproot wasn't active at the time) and I'd love to discuss those on my bips PR. Fortunately they'd be just a few lines of code and tests to change whichever direction we go on them.\r\n\r\nEdit to add: CTV is already in inquisition, btw, and is the bulk of this PR.\r\n\r\n> For comparison, the first Taproot pull request to this repo #17977 was made in early 2020, which was _after_ about year of in person workshops studying the proposal. The BIP's themselves were first proposed in 2018. The first work-in-progress taproot branch, not a pull request, is also from around [2018](https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/taproot1).\r\n\r\nTaproot was a new witness program version, new script system, and new signing system. It is obviously not appropriate to follow the same path here as there.\r\n\r\n> Typically if a pull request depends on another pull request we mark it as draft. That's not the case here, but it does depend on two BIP proposals that were made only two days ago. We could also use some other tag to indicate that the underlying _proposal_ is still in the concept stage.\r\n\r\nI disagree that the underlying proposal is at the concept stage. CTV conceptually was settled years ago, INTERNALKEY (as I said) is a simple binary decision with no room for conceptual discussion really, and CSFS does have a few minor points that can be incorporated here easily if my decisions do not match those of the broader dev community.\r\n\r\nI'd very much appreciate further _code_ review here.",
