      "body" : "Perhaps the best solution is simply to move the example conf back inside `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` in the release tar, as we have it here in the repo? That way if people unzip-to-dir which I assume is how it's usually done?, the example conf also won't be floating loosely inside `/usr/local`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Check contents\r\ntar -tzvf bitcoin-26.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n# Unzip directly to /usr/local\r\nsudo tar -xzvf bitcoin-26.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C /usr/local/\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO folks looking for an example conf would also be more likely to look for and find it in `share/`.

      "body" : "Somewhat unrelated but the `datadir` option in the `bitcoin.conf` is also a bit confusing. If you set it inside the default location of `bitcoin.conf` then it also ends up creating another `bitcoin.conf` inside the set datadir folder, which then confuses a user on which `bitcoin.conf` is used for the rest of the settings(I assume the one in the `datadir`).\r\nI always end up specifying the `-datadir` with the `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-cli` commands. May be it's fine this way but just thought I should mention here, not really sure about a more accurate solution though.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Specify data directory\r\n#datadir=<dir>\r\n```",
