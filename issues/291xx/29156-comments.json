In a similar spirit I improved #29154 (also adding a 2nd commit with your suggestion, and in that case we can also assert that order of xpubs in the multisig descriptors don't matter since it is `sorted`).\r\n\r\n> Also, one thing I am unsure of is if we should include this test in test/functional/wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py since they are very similar and maybe we can use common functions but I am not sure what will be the cleanest\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be too much trouble to combine them, but I didn't go that route because my opinion is that some code duplication is preferable to trying to generalize/combine these tests. So I went the route of keeping these as two simple independent integration tests. I don't have a strong opinion on this, but usually for test code like this I lean towards approach I took where I duplicate some code to favor simple and easy to explain/delete tests. If more people feel strongly one way or the other I'm happy to change though",

I personally wouldn't be against adding some Miniscript explanation, examples in `descriptors.md` but I'd want a short explanation of what Miniscript is making it clear that this decaying multisig example is enabled by Miniscript and not just added to the list of descriptor examples. Maybe longer term there should be a `miniscript.md` but for now that seems fine to me.",
