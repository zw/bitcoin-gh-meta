In a similar spirit I improved #29154 (also adding a 2nd commit with your suggestion, and in that case we can also assert that order of xpubs in the multisig descriptors don't matter since it is `sorted`).\r\n\r\n> Also, one thing I am unsure of is if we should include this test in test/functional/wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py since they are very similar and maybe we can use common functions but I am not sure what will be the cleanest\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be too much trouble to combine them, but I didn't go that route because my opinion is that some code duplication is preferable to trying to generalize/combine these tests. So I went the route of keeping these as two simple independent integration tests. I don't have a strong opinion on this, but usually for test code like this I lean towards approach I took where I duplicate some code to favor simple and easy to explain/delete tests. If more people feel strongly one way or the other I'm happy to change though",
