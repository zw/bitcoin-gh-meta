   "body" : "C++20 introduced the `contains` method on containers to check if an element is in the container. It can be used instead of the `count` method now.\r\nI believe it is easier to understand, as `contains` directly returns a `bool` indicating whether the element exists, while `count` returns the number of occurrences of the element, which then often needs to be compared against 0.\r\nAlso, it is slightly more efficient than count for this use-case.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces the clang-tidy check `readability-container-contains` and fixes the instances where `count` is being used where `contains` could be used instead. I used the clang-tidy -fix option to do it automatically.",
