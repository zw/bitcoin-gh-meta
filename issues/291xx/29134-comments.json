If for our storage, I would be interested in seeing benchmarks as this would have an effect on how quickly things can be pulled from disk to be relayed. If for relay, then I think there should first be a BIP that describes the protocol for using compression and how that is negotiated. And if neither of those, then I don't think it's within the scope of Bitcoin Core. It seems to be a pretty significant maintenance burden for something that, as implemented, is only used by specific new RPCs.",
