I made a similar bugfix in 870160359e7cec9f66c7c26f01f4e65b40f35e1b from #17493, but it made specifying `-rpcauth=\"\"` an error instead of an ignored parameter, which I think would be a better thing to do here. You can read 870160359e7cec9f66c7c26f01f4e65b40f35e1b for a description of the current behavior, it is pretty crazy.\r\n\r\nI think this PR (as of 6b79de4f9aed365adda0a99d6522e83ccb6c593f) would be an definite improvement it it had two tweaks:\r\n\r\n- It would be great if it dropped the `if (rpcauth.empty()) continue;` line and treated `-rpcauth=\"\"` as an error consistently.\r\n- It would be great if the new python tests were added as a first commit, and the bugfix was added as a second commit, that way it would be a lot more obvious what current behavior is and how the bugfix changes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
