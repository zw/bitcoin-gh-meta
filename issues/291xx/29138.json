   "body" : "The Bitcoin blockchain is designed primarily for storing transaction data, though it has also accommodated other types of data, including non-transaction elements like images (JPGs) and malicious uploads. While these elements may not directly impact the functionality of the blockchain, they pose security risks and clutter the network. To address these concerns, detection and mitigation of non-transaction and malicious elements in the Bitcoin blockchain is essential and tabled for incentivised action, primarily including but not limited to:\n\nData Size Analysis\nContent Fingerprinting\nTransaction Pattern Analysis\nCommunity-Based Detection\nBlockchain Pruning\nContent Hosting Services\nCustom Block Validation Rules\nCommunity Governance Mechanisms\n\n\nThe time is now, now is the time.",
