While these elements may not directly impact the functionality of the blockchain, they pose security risks and clutter the network. To address these concerns, detection and mitigation of non-transaction and malicious elements in the Bitcoin blockchain is essential and tabled for incentivised action, primarily including but not limited to:\n\nData Size Analysis\nContent Fingerprinting\nTransaction Pattern Analysis\nCommunity-Based Detection\nBlockchain Pruning\nContent Hosting Services\nCustom Block Validation Rules\nCommunity Governance Mechanisms\n\n\nThe time is now, now is the time.",
