This, in turn, enables the monitoring of new addresses/scripts and tracking balance changes without the need to repeatedly download the entire blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe first project milestone introduces the feature for prune nodes that construct and maintain a local block filters set database. The node will request and keep track of the missing historical blocks that match the wallet scripts filters set to subsequently perform the rescan.\r\n\r\n#### The following sections are ordered by their PRs dependencies:\r\n\r\n##### Net: Single Block Requests Tracking System and On Download Failure Retry Mechanism\r\n* [ ] #28170\r\n* [ ] #28120\r\n* [ ] #27837\r\n\r\n##### Indexes Stability and Performance Improvements\r\n* [X] #27607\r\n* [X] #27720\r\n* [ ] #28955\r\n* [ ] #26966\r\n\r\n##### Wallet Rescan (depends on the net section)\r\n* [X] #27469\r\n* [ ] Cache wallet filters' set and connect it to the current wallet rescan functionality.
