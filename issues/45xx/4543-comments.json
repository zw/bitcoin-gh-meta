The only difference should be that it doesn't disconnect whitelisted nodes, and the code where the disconnect is done should have the code to exclude the whitelisted nodes. The misbehaving function itself doesn't need to change.\r\n\r\nOh... goodness.. the code is so confusing currently. Why doesn't the Misbehave function deal with pto->fWhitelisted and LogPrint appropriately? It doesn't need an extra message later on in the code to say that it's going to ignore the fShouldBan that Misbehave set... I'll fix the spam issue and push another update...",
