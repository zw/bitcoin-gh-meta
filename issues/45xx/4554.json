To start, this change allows all supported platforms to build against a static Qt. 5.2.1 and 5.3 have been successfully tested against osx64, win32, win64, linux32, and linux64.\r\n\r\nIt also makes a small change to the windows config, to allow linking against qt builds with or without built-in libjpeg/libpng/libpcre/libz.\r\n\r\nThe actual build processes to take advantage of these changes (for gitian and pull-tester) are forthcoming. Until then, this should be a no-op.",
