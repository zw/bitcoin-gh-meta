For two reasons\r\n\r\n- We are not convinced of the robustness of the new code. @gmaxwell (or was it @sipa) experienced some memory corruptions that were likely introduced with these changes. This means more testing and review is necessary.\r\n\r\n- Because the change itself is controversial. People are polarized around it. Does the current solution provide protection against double spends, or does it open up new angles to do so? (according to @SergioDemianLerner it does) I think the proper place for this higher-level discussion is the mailing list, not this github.\r\n",

(given that the ultimate goal here seems to make the usage of 0-conf more safe, I assume that's a property that is unwanted).\r\n* If people do start using it to increase safety of using 0-conf transactions, attackers can move to either sending double spends directly to miners (in which case again it is just extra code complexity and bandwidth) or potentially to flooding the rate-limited double-spend channel (even worse).\r\n* It removes the ability to rely on the property that bitcoind only relays what it considers valid itself (which is unreasonable on the p2p network, but reasonable if you're running a trusted own node acting as a gateway for other services). (though this can be solved by making the relaying optional, or using a separate message for it).\r\n* There have been several implementation problems with it since it was merged, indicating insufficient review. @laanwj: not memory corruption, but a mempool inconsistency (see #4517).\r\n\r\nOverall, I believe this is not a feature that the P2P network can perform. Things might have been different if our signing scheme supported short proofs of double spending, but it doesn't (such proofs are as long as the transactions themselves + inputs consumed). Moving the functionality to more specialized transactions (as suggested by @petertodd) or a separate double-spending relay network seems more viable.\r\n",

Yes there have been other issues, but we've got a very motivated contributor, @dgenr8, who is working hard to fix the issues as they're found. I'd be inclined to give him some more time to do that, and it'll be easier to do so if the patch is left merged. Of course, this does need to be re-evaluated again closer to release.\r\n\r\nThe bigger picture is regardless of which side is right, the patch is better, if not perfect. If it really does help prevent doublespends then it's better. If it doesn't it help it gets us further towards a replace-by-fee model. I don't believe it will do significant, if any, harm to non-zeroconf usage of Bitcoin, and if anything, it will be a useful testing ground for applications like fee-bumping, which again has proven hard to get consensus on.\r\n\r\n@dgenr8 We should temporarily allocate a NODE_RELAY_DOUBLESPENDS service bit in the experimental range and set it. You could then find nodes on the network that had adopted this new behavior and interconnect them manually to get info on how the behavior works in practice. We can drop the service bit prior to the 0.10 release.",

This is only possible because 1) the merchant is identifiable by his addresses 2) the merchant personally confirmed to me that he was suffering these losses (he did \"hand over the goods\") and 3) tx2 paid only the sole non-merchant tx1 address (so \"matched decrease\" doesn't overstate the loss). \r\n\r\nDue to being alerted (out of band, not by bitcoin core), this merchant has modified his services and no successful double-spends against him have been recorded by these 2 nodes since 6/20/2014.\r\n\r\nThe data set implies an upper bound of ~346 BTC from 5/3/2014 through today on losses suffered due to confirmed double-spends that the 2 nodes recorded.  Transactions where tx2 actually paid more to tx1 addresses have been netted from this number.  It overstates any actual losses by an unknown and probably large amount, because address ownership, quid pro quo, and other transactions between the parties are unknown, just to name a few factors.\r\n",

Everyone else cut their losses to zero pretty quickly by changing their practices to avoid depending on zeroconf for security.\r\n\r\nAs for clients, I can say that among other things Mullvad is interested in using replace-by-fee scorched-earth to secure micropayment channels.",

In this regard it seems to be working - a bug that took days to trigger consistency checks was found. As new features are being merged I guess the next release is not imminent, so more \"baking time\" is a good thing. If there still are issues being found close to release time, then sure, it'd make more sense to back it out or disable it. Otherwise it's expected that master can be less stable than release code.\r\n\r\n2) New tests are being written and new improvements being made already. So I think this will help find any further issues that may be lurking.\r\n\r\n3) Philosophical discussions can go around in circles forever. There *must* be a decision point: that decision point was Gavin merging the change. A lack of such decision points will just turn Bitcoin into Wikipedia, subject to constant back-and-forth edit wars with no clarity over direction and no ability to make progress on anything beyond simple optimisations.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "I'm afraid dgenr8's example above is misleading.  I was unable to find in my own data the example he was referring to, and so I inquired off thread with Tom.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that what he's referring to were recent double spends against SatoshiBonesÃ¢ÂÂ this is a 'blockchain gambling site' which, like 'satoshidice' communicates with the gamblers by return transactions. Attackers can attempt to profitably double spend these sites by selectively conflicting them if and only if they discover they've lost their bets via the loss spend. Double spend relay is unhelpful in this case because its inherently too late and, if anything, would reduce the security of these (_very_ ill advised) cases since it would enable more miners to engage in a highest-fee policy which would increase the success rate of the later adaptive conflicts.\r\n\r\n(Though I don't find the reduction argument terribly compelling here, since it's easy enough to do replace-by-fee regardlessÃ¢ÂÂ and already the notion that that kind of service is completely insecure (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=327767.0) is already fairly well socialized)\r\n",

It's also been double spent at several times in the past (and see also the betcoin dice thread I linked where 3k btc were stolen by ghash.io, and most of the people responding are blaming the victim for their insecure transaction practices which were the same as satoshi bones). ... Bitcoin-QT already tells you when a transaction conflicting with your wallet shows up in a block (wallet conflicts field, and confirm count -1).  So between a direct personal warning from and the wallet telling you when you've been hosed, I'm not sure what more notice you expect would have helped.\r\n\r\nEach of the interactions with the site are independent. You can't know that an individual interaction with the site is going to be double-spent until its too late (because the double-spender inherently must wait until loss-notification to double-spend). So every attempt is the \"first\" from this perspective. (And if, instead, you mean knowing that the whole transaction style was vulnerable the fact that this is well know, was reported directly to the operator of the site, and that bitcoin-qt already tells you when you lost relative to what your wallet was showing you, means that there wasn't a question of knowing the service was vulnerable and being ripped off)",
