Bumping the patch version fixes that issue on both systems.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to add `.python-version` to your local git excludes and then do `pyenv local 3.6.15`, but this won't persist when you switch branches. Another workaround is to disable `pyenv`, but then you're potentially not running the test suite against the oldest supported Python version.",
