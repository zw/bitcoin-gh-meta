As a result, we can not rely on this value to determine if syncing is complete. We can not rely on `getblockchaininfo.initialblockdownload` either due to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26432\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nCall `getblockchaininfo` on a synced node and observe that `verificationprogress` is < 1.0. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nVersion 22 of the bitcoin core binary, downloaded from the website\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
