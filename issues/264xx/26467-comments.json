We don't check if it's within the inputs amount bounds nor if need to create a change output for the remaining amount (value can be lower than the inputs amount).\r\n\r\nCurrent code instead of create a change output when the value is lower than the inputs amount, it sets the value equal to inputs total minus new fee. We should code a test for it too.\r\n\r\nThus why thought about using SFFO in 27195 to mark the output from where we want to subtract fees, so the apparent \"single output tx\" can be crafted using `CreateTransaction` instead of making an special case here.\r\n\r\nCould use that instead of using the change destination. Outputs cannot be changed if the \"reduce\" option is set.\r\n\r\nSide from that, all good about closing 27195. I made it just because it's a bug in master.",
