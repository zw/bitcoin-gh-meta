   "body" : "`p2p_sendtxrcncl.py` currently fails intermittently in the CI, see e.g. https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5511952184115200?logs=ci#L4024\r\n\r\nI believe that this is related to the reuse of the parameter `p2p_idx=2` of `add_outbound_p2p_connection` in this test: When we call `peer_disconnect`, we don't wait until the node has completed the disconnection. So there is a race between setting up the next connection (next  `addconnection` RPC), and if the old one hasn't been removed and has an identical port like the new one (because we didn't increment `p2p_idx`), `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection` just [returns](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5274f324375fd31cf8507531fbc612765d03092f/src/net.cpp#L1976) without establishing a connection, and the test fails.\r\n\r\nFix this by using distinct `disconnect_p2ps` instead of `peer_disconnect`, which waits for the disconnect to complete. We can then use the same value for `p2p_idx` everywhere.",
