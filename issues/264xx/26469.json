   "body" : "Affects the `getblock` rpc call with the goal of adding the ability to call `getblock` with a hash or block height whist not impacting compatibility with existing services that rely on the `getblock` call. \r\n\r\n### **Motivation** \r\nDecrease the number of RPC calls needed to get valid data from `getblock` where the user has only a block height available. As well as reduce complexity, bandwidth, and overhead. _Note: `getblock` returns the hash of the block when parsed._\r\n\r\n### **Overview** ###\r\nIt is trivial to implement a check where the input univalue string (string) to `getblock` is greater than or less than a length of 64. This is because all valid block header hashes are a length of 64. This means if the input is not length 64 we should attempt to interpret the string as a block height input and pass it to `ParseHashOrHeight`  and then retreive the `phashBlock` (hash) value from the returned block at the input height. This hash value can be dropped into the existing `blockhash` variable leaving the rest of the call unmodified. \r\n\r\nIf the length of the input is 64 the univalue is treated as a blockhash and passed though `ParseHashOrHeight` to get the block header hash value.\r\n\r\n### **Contentious Points** ###\r\n**Ambiguity**\r\n\r\nThe fact that a user can now parse a **hash** or a **block height** as the required input argument to param[0]. There may be the issue of inputs being seen as too flexible or ambiguous. \r\n\r\nMy thoughts behind this are because a valid `getblock` hash input will always be a univalue string with length of 64 there _likely_ wont be a base10 block height collision with the base16 hash inputs for  1.9*10^58 years assuming a block time of ~10 mins. Well before the collision of the block height with hash values all of datatypes we for block height storage and parsing would be refactored to support values that would overflow the `unit64_t` type. **As such a block height could never reasonably be interpreted as a hash. By software or people** \r\n\r\nThe next note about ambiguity of inputs is that a hash no matter the actual numerical value when read must be a string of length 64. Example a hash value of 0 would still need to be input as `\"000...000\"`\r\n\r\n### **Implementation Details**\r\nOverall the implementation is pretty simple. If input string is anything other than a `univalue str` of length 64 attempt to parse as a block height using `ParseHashOrHeight`. Since the maximum number `height_or_hash` input parameter value is a uint64t. We use the  ParseUInt64 function with the input being the `.get_str` of param[0]. This function works incredibly well because it by default doesn't accept negative values, alpha chars. , strings that overflow a unit64_t type, and symbol chars.  If the conversion to a unit64t is successful it is then safe to pass into `ParseHashOrHeight`. \r\n\r\nIf the user places a value higher than the tip they will get an `error code -8: Target block height _m_ after current tip _n_`. If the user inputs an invalid string for height then they will receive and error code -5\r\n\r\nthe `blockhash` parameter name was left unchanged for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n### **Backward Compatibility** ###\r\nShould be fully backwards compatible with all existing applications that use `getblock` and are supplying even remotely valid inputs. This is just a drop in check to see if `getblock` should make an attempt to convert an input to a block height.\r\n",
