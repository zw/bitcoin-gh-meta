Miner is of course taking less in fees by doing this.\r\n\r\nIn this particular V3 context, it just means your CPFP could change txid, wouldn't do anything else. Maybe in a more general context if we weren't restricted to V3 topology this would be an issue? In the context of keyless anchors, I'm not sure that will ever make sense anyways.\r\n\r\n~~The \"fix\" would be: `OP_DEPTH OP_0 OP_EQUAL`, making it consensus-non-malleable at the cost of 8 additional WU. Seems like a bad tradeoff, noting anyways.~~\r\n\r\n```\r\n<_aj_> instagibbs: can't a blockmaker put \"OP_NOP OP_NOP OP_NOP\" in the scriptSig and also satisfy a scriptPubKey of \"DEPTH 0 EQUAL\" ?\r\n```\r\nlegacy script: i cri everytim\r\n\r\nThis also means the child transaction spending the ephemeral anchor cannot be relied upon for further transaction chaining, e.g., spent in a splice-in for a LN channel, since the funding output can have its txid mutated. A soft-fork would be necessary.",

As discussed offline, the general problem is with calling `TrimToSize` in the middle of package validation (meaning something can go from already-in-mempool to evicted, or just-submitted to evicted) so a coin may be cached in `m_view` but then it disappears from the mempool/temporary coins in `m_viewmempool`. Crash is in `CheckInputsFromMempoolAndCache` which asserts the coin exists, but it doesn't anymore. Will open a separate PR to address this since it's also a problem pre-v3.",

Okay, so a miner cannot add extra pushes to the input script that spends the anchor, but there is nothing to stop the miner from mining an alternative child transaction that spends *only* the anchor. Thus, the party that had broadcast the original child transaction will be forced to construct a new spending transaction with a different TxID anyway. Indeed, anyone (not only a miner) is free to propose a replacement child that spends *only* the anchor, so it will never be okay to depend upon the TxID of a transaction that spends an ephemeral anchor. So again I ask, what is the point of having a non-malleable ephemeral anchor?",

This requires the ephemeral anchor-spending tx(the splice) to retain txid stability otherwise funds are locked up in the new funding output.\r\n\r\nI understand that not all use-cases require such things, but two points:\r\n1) It's easy to expand standardness, and really hard to restrict. In deploying one version, we'll likely learn lessons we'd want to apply to other versions. If we see tons of uptake from wallets that explicitly don't care about txid stability? That's a signal as well.\r\n2) \"I don't see the problem\" is much weaker than \"there is no problem\" and I'd rather be able to reason via modern bitcoin rules",
