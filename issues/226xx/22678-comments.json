When plugging in a hardware wallet, the wallet already exists, you're just loading keys from it.\r\n\r\nThere is a BIP 32 account feature buried in ExternalSignerPubkeyMan, which we could expose through the RPC and GUI. That would let you manage multiple wallets with separate address spaces. In terms of compatibility, afaik at e.g. the Ledger standard wallet software also knows how to find these accounts. ",
