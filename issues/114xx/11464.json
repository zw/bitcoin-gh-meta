That can only be seen in the details or via 'listunspent' command\r\n\r\n## Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n## If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n1. create raw transaction to own address with multiple inputs\r\n2. send the raw transaction with a miner fee\r\n3. overall balance stays the same minus miner fee, in the transactions tab shows 'payment to yourself' without the receiving address\r\n\r\n## Expected behaviour\r\nI'd expect the payment to show up as a received payment with (my own) recipient address and 'payment to self' tag.\r\n\r\n## Actual behaviour\r\nQt client only shows miner fee as 'transacted' and shows what seems to be an empty transaction without a receiving address in the transactions tab.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots.\r\n\r\n![qtweird](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11705841/31320956-d335c23a-ac7d-11e7-99f8-c696437c7f99.png)\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nList the version number/commit ID, and if it is an official binary, self compiled or a distribution package such as PPA.\r\n\r\nCore 14.02\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 14.04\r\n- CPU: amd\r\n- RAM: 8G\r\n- Disk size: 360Gb\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD):Sata\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\n\r\n",
