      "body" : "@sdaftuar Indeed. You were right, I was confused, but this does leave the logic being added here super brittle to future changes. For those following along at home, the reason compact blocks always passing fRequested as true doesn't break this is that it does a CanDirectFetch first, which only looks at the timestamp of our chainActive.Tip(). Thus, this logic would be broken if there were any way for an attacker to cheaply feed us a single best-chain block which had a timestamp close to today, though there should be no way to do so as other ways to get the block onto disk (and, thus, to become our chainActive.Tip()) without meeting the nMinimumChainWork test in FindNextBlocksToDownload. This anti-DoS-logic-stradling-validation-and-net_processing stuff irritates me endlessly, but I think this is fine for now (and should likely be backported in 0.15.0.2 if we do one as a part of #11531).\r\n\r\nutACK (didn't review test changes, which will conflict with #11531) f0940e462cb435f10ef6f052dae609655202f245",

Skipping the call to AcceptBlockHeader doesn't do much in the adversarial case (which is the only case we're concerned about here), because an attacker would just separately deliver the header which we would process and store.
