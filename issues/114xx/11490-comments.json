Then we have a peer we get headers from who is a single block behind us.   This would disconnect them, and I think that is probably undesirable.\r\n\r\nIt's probably a good idea to review all code as if IsInitialBlockDownload() were just return true; and if there would be misbehavior in that case, then the usage is perhaps suboptimal.\r\nAn obvious conservative thing to do would be to just use the nMinimumChainWork ... though perhaps too conservative.  It might also be reasonable to use a GetBlockProofEquivalentTime like test, or just the work several blocks back from chainactive tip.   I think if it was conservative enough it could apply at all times, not just IsIninitialBlockDownload().  \r\n\r\nMaybe the existence of the second commit means that it would be okay for this one to be less aggressive?",
