And I've got another change to CAlert (give testnet its own alert keypair) that'll be a good time to change it.\r\n\r\nI decided against new command-line arguments / bitcoin.conf options to make it really easy to override the CLIENT_NAME or CLIENT_VERSION reported to peers; those would be easy-to-add-later features.\r\n",
