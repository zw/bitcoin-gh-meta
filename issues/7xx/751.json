The debian maintainer for Bitcoin asked me a while ago (and I never got around to filing a bug report for it) if it were possible for us to revert back to the original version so that it is possible to use a packaged version.  To do this, we need support for forcing numerical output to do fixed-length output of reals (see http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/JSON_Spirit.aspx?fid=448567&tid=3909548 and scroll to the bottom to read a brief thread on the subject, it would be much appreciated if someone could take up that topic and continue with this issue).",
