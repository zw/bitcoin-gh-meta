Especially when using the 'portable' \".zip\" version, it would be nice to have it all localized, aka, not use any external directories. I was thinking by default it should try \"%installation_dir%\\data\\\" :). Then again I hate the idea of the %appdata% gimic for any app.\n\nHaving it configurable via gui would be a nice compromise though. I also seen another suggestion via \"private\" and \"public\" data. It'd be nice to separate this so it's like \"wallet.dat + personalized settings/labels\" in folder a, and \"blockchain stuff\" in folder b. It'd be easier for new people to know what needs to be backed up. By default they can be the same directory (as is now).",
