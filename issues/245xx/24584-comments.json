Though, if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24362 is merged, then it would probably not be worth it to optimize for fees.\r\n\r\nI prefer this approach over #24362 in order to keep the privacy benefits of matching change output addresses for all address types. I also see this as a small first step, where we can optimize for fees in a later PR if it is deemed useful/worth it. ",

I was just discussing this idea with people yesterday.\r\n\r\nA couple comments on the approach described in the OP:\r\n- I noticed that you suggest preferring the spending of older types and compare it to spending newer types preferentially. While I do agree that the old types are the ones we'd want to get rid off rather, I am not sure this would lead to the optimal outcome. I would suggest running coin selection for each of the OutputGroup sets in parallel and then choosing the input set per the waste metric. Due to how the waste metric works, I'd expect this to lead to the older larger output types getting preferentially spent at lower feerates (and in the current feerate environment, usually first). What are your thoughts on that?\r\n- Regarding splitting the OutputGroups: since each OutputGroup will only have one type, you could just get the available set once and subdivide it from there to run the coin selection in parallel. Would that perhaps be easier?\r\n- CoinSelection is pretty fast, with the exception of Knapsack, so running it on subsets of the UTXO pool shouldn't be a huge issue, running it on all subsets in parallel may be even faster than running it on the whole UTXO pool once since the complexity of each subset would be much smaller.\r\n\r\nCeterum censeo Knapsackinem esse delendam.",

Due to how the waste metric works, I'd expect this to lead to the older larger output types getting preferentially spent at lower feerates (and in the current feerate environment, usually first). What are your thoughts on that?\r\n\r\nThis makes a lot of sense. By running coin selection on each OutputGroup set you are preserving privacy by avoiding mixing the inputs, but also still choosing the best spend w.r.t to fees. Running them in parallel (as opposed to sequentially) also helps speed things up (which you also mentioned).\r\n\r\nI'll work on refactoring to implement this.\r\n\r\n",

Since the UTXO pools divided by type are much smaller, the backoff steps allowing for unconfirmed change to be used may come into play much more often. Then, since the waste metric does not yet account for the unconfirmed inputs, we may spend unconfirmed UTXOs more often. This in turn may cause a problem especially if the follow-up transaction is aiming for a higher feerate than the transaction that created the unconfirmed input, at least while https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15553 remains unsolved.

      "body" : "I'm wondering whether there is a misunderstanding here. It's not that certain types are strictly preferred at the corresponding feerate categories, but that larger input scripts will simply affect the waste score more due to their size in either direction due to their larger transaction weight. This in turn leads to a higher waste score for _the same count of_ legacy inputs at high feerates vs more efficient types, and a more negative waste score at low feerates. Obviously, this would cause one specific type to always win if you always have the same count of inputs among the options, but wouldn't necessarily hold true if the input sets could have varying input counts.",

A single input transaction will always have the same type for all inputs. :grin: Given that I understood that right, it would be more convincing if the wallets had to select from a number of UTXOs of various values and types, and needed to pick multiple UTXOs to create the input set, while you then showed that we consistently pick input sets with multiple inputs of the same type. I also feel that the inputs being of the same type would be the more important aspect of this PR rather than which type of inputs gets chosen exactly, although showing that the solution with the lower waste was picked would certainly be an appreciated secondary test scenario.\r\nâ¢ The way these tests are implemented right now, they may be a bit too tightly coupled to the exact behavior of the coin selection algorithms we currently use, but I am hoping to change the composition of coin selection algorithms in the near term. This would be another reason why I'd prefer if the test were implemented more generically \"all input have the same type\" vs \"exactly this type of inputs gets chosen\". :)",

I'll refactor the test to:\r\n\r\n* Document the initial setup for each node\r\n* Start with a larger, mixed UTXO set\r\n* Be less brittle w.r.t to coin selection\r\n\r\nLooking at the test again, I think I am trying to test for some things that would be better to test for in a unit test. Ideally, this test should create large UTXO sets for each node, spend back and forth at different fee rates and to different address types. The assertions should check that all inputs are of the same OutputType and finally test a scenario where the wallet can fund from any single OutputType and is forced to mix OutputTypes to fund the transaction",

This way you try to do selection for every output type for confirmed UTXOs only, before you try unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThis is how I wrote the code initially (by adding `OutputType` to `CoinEligibilityFilter`) but abandoned it in favor of separating the `OutputTypes` into different vectors during `GetAvailableCoins` and then running coin selection on each vector separately and comparing the results.\r\n\r\n> Another possibility is adding the logic for preferring confirmed over unconfirmed UTXOs to `SelectionResult` and editing the `operator<` to account for it.\r\n\r\nI like this idea.

I have started a branch (https://github.com/Xekyo/bitcoin/tree/ancestor-aware-funding) which I intend to push forward in collaboration with @glozow. We were stuck by not being able to get information on unconfirmed parent transactions in the wallet yet, and this should now be resolved by a node:wallet interface that provides mining scores which @glozow came up with.\r\n\r\nThen, the intended goal is that we'd automatically add sufficient fees to elevate the mining score for both the new and the ancestor transactions to the target feerate and account for these additional fees in the waste metric.",

This puts P2SH outputs which are multisig into the legacy bucket @achow101 \r\n* Instead of running `SelectCoins` multiple times over each `OutputType`, I moved the logic into `AttemptSelection`. This ensures that all of the existing back-offs are respected, which addressed the issue regarding unconfirmed change @Xekyo @glozow \r\n* Refactored the test to be better documented and less brittle w.r.t coin selection\r\n* Removed changes to existing functional tests as they are no longer failing after fixing the unconfirmed change issue. I do believe there is room for improvement if a test relies on specific behavior from coin selection, but that is out of the scope of this PR",

      "body" : "I'm not sure that's an apt comparison. Address reuse is generally discouraged and hopefully happens seldom for most wallets, especially those that care about privacy. In addition, we already run opportunistic avoid-partial-spend in parallel for every single coin selection attempt and prefer its result as long as it is not more expensive even when not explicitly required.\r\n\r\nThis PR however follows a change in the wallet behavior that will generally match the output type of the recipient on every spend. We must expect wallets to frequently have outputs of different types as a result. This PR does not introduce avoidance of mixing as parallel coin selection results but rather requires it for almost all selection attempts. Splitting the UTXO pool into two or more sets doesn't half the size of the possible input set candidates, but reduces the combination space to tiny fractions.\r\n\r\nI expect this already to cause a reduction in changeless transactions, but worse, I expect the change as proposed to considerably increase the use of unconfirmed inputs and thusly reduce the resulting transactions' reliability. Given the existing feerate estimation issue with unconfirmed inputs, this would more frequently cause the wallet to undershoot the target feerate, especially if we allow up to 12 unconfirmed inputs before considering mixing.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer that mixing be allowed with r2, I'd be okay with r3. I might be convinced to introduce mixing on r4 via simulation results showing that coin selection results and reliability do not get significantly worse. My stance on this would generally be improved by us having finished ancestor aware fee estimation and the waste metric having been updated to account for automatic bumping of low feerate parent transactions.\r\n\r\nI'd also be curious what others think about this.",

Finally, Bob sends the remainder of his funds, which requires mixing.\n+\n+The payment values are random, but chosen such that they sum up to a specified\n+total. This ensures we are not relying on specific values for the UTXOs,\n+but still know when to expect mixing due to the wallet being close to empty.\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+import random\n+from test_framework.test_framework import BitcoinTestFramework\n+from test_framework.blocktools import COINBASE_MATURITY\n+\n+ADDRESS_TYPES = [\n+    \"bech32m\",\n+    \"bech32\",\n+    \"p2sh-segwit\",\n+    \"legacy\",\n+]\n+\n+\n+def is_bech32_address(node, addr):\n+    \"\"\"Check if an address contains a bech32 output.\"\"\"\n+    addr_info = node.getaddressinfo(addr)\n+    if addr_info['iswitness']:\n+        return (\n+            not addr_info['isscript'] and\n+            addr_info['iswitness'] and addr_info['witness_version'] == 0\n+        )\n+    return False\n+\n+\n+def is_bech32m_address(node, addr):\n+    \"\"\"Check if an address contains a bech32m output.\"\"\"\n+    addr_info = node.getaddressinfo(addr)\n+    if addr_info['iswitness']:\n+        return (\n+            addr_info['isscript'] and\n+            addr_info['iswitness'] and addr_info['witness_version'] == 1\n+        )\n+    return False\n+\n+\n+def is_p2sh_address(node, addr):\n+    \"\"\"Check if an address contains a P2SH output.\"\"\"\n+    addr_info = node.getaddressinfo(addr)\n+    return (\n+        addr_info['isscript'] and\n+        not addr_info['iswitness']\n+    )\n+\n+\n+def is_legacy_address(node, addr):\n+    \"\"\"Check if an address contains a legacy output.\"\"\"\n+    addr_info = node.getaddressinfo(addr)\n+    return (not addr_info['isscript'] and not addr_info['iswitness'])",

I'd submit that `AvailableCoins` was more descriptive.âIsn't any function's output a \"result\"? It feels like adding \"â¦Result\" dosen't add any information. The most notable things about this struct are that it a) lists the available UTXOs, b) separated by output types. These aspects are not captured well by `CoinsResult`.  \r\n\r\nSince `AvailableCoins` seems to be out of favor: We usually call the set of UTXOs available to a wallet its \"UTXO pool\". Since this codebase uses \"Coin\" for UTXO  frequently, maybe call this struct `CoinPool`, or `CoinPools` to stress that there are multiple sets?\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\nstruct CoinPools {\r\n```",

This was my point in the quoted part of comment.\r\n\r\ngotcha, i think we are on the same page, unless i am misunderstanding your comment. my point was this is not related to average user behavior. for example:\r\n\r\nif i have P2PKH as my default and i regularly pay to bech32/bech32m addresses, i will begin to accumulate non-default UTXOs in my wallet, which might be undesirable for me, the user.\r\n\r\nalthough, reading this again, that section of the description is a bit outdated. originally, i implemented this to prefer spending \"older types\" first, but it was pointed out by other reviewers that it would be better to always spend the most economical UTXOs without forcing an ordering by `OutputType`. ill update the the description to remove references to older type UTXOs as that is not really the primary concern of this PR: the issue this PR addresses is the privacy leak that can happen when different type UTXOs are mixed when funding a transaction.",

Create a wallet w1, send 0.001 four times from signet faucet to bech32 addresses, wait for confirmation and spend more than 0.002 to a legacy address.\r\n> \r\n>     2. There will be 2 UTXO in wallet: 1 legacy and other bech32\r\n> \r\n>     3. Send more than 0.001 to a bech32 address\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Example:\r\n> \r\n> https://mempool.space/signet/tx/6bb60f7dd4171d915b615030bc3cd2af785188834f38f391aa6b28e6a5359ecb:0\r\n> \r\n> https://mempool.space/signet/tx/2cd2821390126c5407f29be8669c612a4092d0bc11224811a0752ff7fa31d43a\r\n\r\nI don't see how this example tests what is described in the OP? You ended up making a transaction that has mixed inputs, but the that's because those are the only funds in your wallet. The point of this PR is to *avoid* mixing input types, not *never* mix input types.",

      "body" : "hey @1440000bytes , thanks for testing! as mentioned, the goal is not to _never_ mix; the goal is to avoid mixing if possible. I've updated the OP to explicitly state this. also, take a look at the functional test, as this demonstrates the desired behavior: creating a wallet with mixed UTXO types, funding several transactions without mixing, and finally emptying the wallet (which is impossible to do without mixing).\r\n\r\n> This is a valid argument and there can be multiple interpretations even without coinjoin: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584#pullrequestreview-911639998\r\n\r\nwhile there can be other interpretations, the most likely interpretation today is that the non-default input in the subsequent transaction is the change from the previous transaction (and in the majority of cases, this interpretation is correct).\r\n\r\n> Also still curious about the two questions/solutions I had about solving this problem in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584#issuecomment-1166432804\r\n\r\ni responded here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584#issuecomment-1177991068 , please let me know which parts of your original question you feel are unaddressed.\r\n",
