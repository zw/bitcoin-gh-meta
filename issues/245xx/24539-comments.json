There may be several (conflicting) pre-signed txs spending it and as soon as it is spent, all entities with ownership in it want to check which pre-signed tx spent the coin.\r\nIf they use Bitcoin Core to monitor the coin, they may use:\r\n* A watch-only wallet (which requires a file on disk and BDB/Sqlite)\r\n* Walk the raw chain and raw mempool themselves (According to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24408#issuecomment-1059188351 this is doable for the chain, but may not be for the mempool)\r\n* Use an index. A blockfilterindex might speed up scanning the chain, whereas this index directly gives the answer.",

      "body" : ">     * `getmempooltxspendingprevout` in #24408 takes a list of outpoints, `gettxospender` takes a single outpoint. Would it make sense to have the same format here (I'd guess a common use case would be to check both RPCs with the same outpoint(s)?)\r\n\r\nBitcoin supports batched RPC request so from a functional p.o.v it's equivalent to passing a list of outpoints but it's a bit easier to reason about imho. \r\nI think that the use case for  `getmempooltxspendingprevout` is a bit different: you want to bump fees for a set of txs that are related to the same channel and want to understand who is spending what. You may also have txs with multiple inputs, and would pass them all together to `getmempooltxspendingprevout`.\r\n\r\nFor `gettxospender` the use case is trying to understand why channels have been closed and react if needed, if we could pass in multiple outpoints they would likely be unrelated.\r\n \r\n>     * Taking this one step further, `getrawtransaction` queries transaction data from the mempool or from blocks (if txindex is enabled) in one RPC. Would it make sense to have something similar for outpoints, instead of two separate RPCs?\r\n\r\nMaybe, let's see where the discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24408 but to me it feels cleaner to have separate calls.\r\n\r\n>     * I think that the indexed data will not be deleted in case of a reorg (but possibly overwritten if an outpoint would be spent in a different tx as a result of a reorg). That means that a result from `gettxospender` could be stale. Would it make sense to delete entries or should we at least mention this possibility in the rpc doc?\r\n> \r\n>     * What's the reason for the dependency on -txindex? As far as I can see it's not technical, so would knowing the fact that an outpoint was used in a tx (even if we can't lookup the details of that tx further) be sufficient for some use cases?\r\n\r\nWe would almost always want to get the actual tx that spends our outpoint. My reasoning was that relying on `-txindex` makes `gettxospender` robust and consistent in the case of reorgs and is also simpler and easier to understand that storing block positions instead of txids.
