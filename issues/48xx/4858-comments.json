Because of ABI issues you must build the dependencies with the same compiler that you use for bitcoin itself.\r\n\r\nHis idea is to make it easier to build in mingw in windows (i.e. just `make -C depends && ./autogen.sh && ./configure` like in other OSes). But that's completely parallel to the topic of building in MSVC. Different people have different choices in compiler, and it's no problem to accommodate multiple choices as long as someone actively maintains them.\r\n",

I could not get my hands on a copy of these to see what needs to be done to generate headers. Can you point me to where I can download all the generated headers or perhaps you could just email them to me?\r\n\r\nAs for your offer of help with MinGW setup I would gladly accept it. I am in a process of setting WIN7 VM with MinGW but got stuck in a middle of executing of Configure script. Although all dependencies are built and installed the script couldn't find any of them. I am using this one as a guide but it fails if executed in described order: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149479.0",
