   "body" : "`mapDeltas` maintains a map of transaction hashes to pairs of prioritization deltas.  As transactions are removed from the mempool, `mapDeltas` needs to also have these transactions removed.  `ClearPrioritization` is called in `CTxMemPool::removeForBlock` to accomplish this, but there are other ways that transactions are removed from the mempool.  `CTxMemPool::removeConflicts` and `DisconnectTip` in main.cpp both call `CTxMemPool::remove` which is where transactions are erased from `mapTx`.  Perhaps if `ClearPrioritization` were moved to `CTxMemPool::remove` that would be sufficient, but it might be better to store the deltas in the `CTxMemPoolEntry`'s themselves so we don't have to worry about keeping anything in sync.  This would have the downside of storing this extra information for all transactions and not just the few that actually have prioritization deltas.  @luke-jr , maybe you want to have a look?",
