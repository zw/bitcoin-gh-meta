Typically, this message is caused by assigning int variables to bool variables where the int variable contains only values true and false, and could be re declared as type bool. Ii is generally recommended to add \"(0 != X)\" to the expression, which gives the expression the type bool.\r\n\r\nFor more info see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b6801kcy.aspx",
