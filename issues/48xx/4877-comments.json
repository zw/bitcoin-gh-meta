I removed everything from the Bitcoin directory except for bitcoin.conf and bootstrap.dat.  I then tried running the binary that I used with the test for @theuni.  This time, the application did run, and started importing the block chain from bootstrap.dat.  At that point, I quit the application.  There was no output on standard output/error, and there was no crash log (since it didn't crash), but I did save the debug.log.  The string prefix is \"Version 6ee78938e (noroot)\".\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity.  I also tried with 0.9.1, and that also worked, as long as bitcoin.conf was present.
