      "body" : "@tunnelman this is a known problem, and there doesn't appear to be a fix coming any time soon, since the core developers are waiting for #4468 to be ready, which currently breaks core features, so isn't ready to merge yet. I did raise a pull request that fixes the problem you mention, pull request #4431, but this has been closed, so it doesn't look like this is going to be merged either. If you want to test it, and you're familiar with compiling, git merging etc, then feel free to use it - it doesn't download as fast as #4468 (which downloads from multiple nodes concurrently), but it certainly does download faster than the current v0.9.2.1 available for download.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't take much to get #4468 working in a way that doesn't break re-indexing - e.g. the ability to store orphans could be re-introduced, and with the new logic that #4468 provides, not so many orphans would end up being downloaded, and neither would duplicate blocks be downloaded (as is one of the current problems with v0.9.2.1).",
