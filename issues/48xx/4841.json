(I've raised a pull request #4839 to fix this).\r\n\r\nThirdly, shouldn't the node be disconnected after a while, especially if a version message hasn't been received. Currently, it seems the misbehaving node is permitted to stay connected indefinately, and it continues sending invalid tx messages long after the invalid version message.\r\n\r\nIs some misbehaviour logic appropriate here?",
