It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set. For example, in the default C locale, `[a-d]` is equivalent to `[abcd]`. Many  locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales `[a-d]` is typically not equivalent to `[abcd]`; it might be equivalent to `[aBbCcDd]`, for example. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the `LC_ALL` environment variable to the value C.\r\n\r\nContext: [Locale issue found when reviewing #13450](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13450/files#r194877736)\r\n",
