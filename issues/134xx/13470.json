It doesn't make sense to have more than 1 iteration per eval, because the speed per coin as part of a large flush is a more relevant metric then how often you can flush 1 coin. At the same time I didn't want the benches to use up too much  RAM if someone sets `-scaling` to high number.\r\n\r\nTo test a bigger cache increase `N_CACHE_SCALE=1`. The cache is about 40 MB by default, try `N_CACHE_SCALE=100` for more realistic scenarios, but note that test needs ~3x RAM.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a few things the bench framework doesn't seem designed for. Would like some feedback before I refactor it in the wrong direction:\r\n\r\n- [ ] share code with test framework (should support `--disable-test`?)\r\n- [ ] clean up stuff between evals; e.g. I need to reset the coin cache for `CCoinsViewCacheAddCoinFresh` and `CCoinsViewCacheFlush`\r\n- [ ] disable scaling iterations\r\n- [ ] add a memory-scaling argument\r\n- [ ] allow pausing the clock between iterations; e.g. to generate test coins on the fly rather in bulk before the run ",
