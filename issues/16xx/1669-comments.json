But that's not a nice user-visible name, either :-)\n\nMaybe in the future when Bitcoin is a household name, getting a distinct name (\"Satoshi\"?)  will be more pressing.

If you can come up with a great proposal (and implementation) for re-branding that convinces all of the dev team then it's fine with me too.\n",

The \"Satoshi\" core of bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt is the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol; but end users don't even know that exists unless they open up Bitcoin-Qt's debug window.\n\nI'm not sure what's wrong with calling it Bitcoin-Qt like it always has been; there are plenty of software products that use Qt (or at least Q referring to Qt) in their names. But if alternatives are wanted, how about \"Bitcoin Fortified\" or something similar that expresses the fully verifying/secure feature of the client?\n\nAt the very least, Help->\"About Bitcoin\" shouldn't talk about something other than Bitcoin itself (maybe adding a real \"About Bitcoin\" menu item with a summary about the currency might be a good idea, though!).",
