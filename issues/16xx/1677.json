   "body" : "This is a rewrite of the block storage and validation engine.\n\nInstead of blkindex.dat (a database with block tree data, and all transactions and their spendings in the active chain), it uses chain.dat (only block tree data) and coins.dat (pruned txout set). These two databases together are significantly smaller than blkindex.dat (<200 MiB), and only coins.dat is actively needed during block validation, speeding it up significantly (15 minutes for importing 185000 blocks from a local disk file).\n\nBlocks are still stored in blk????.dat files, in the same file format, but smaller files (up to 128 MiB). To prevent excessive fragmentation, they are allocated in chunks of 16 MiB, and some statistics are kept about them. To assist with reorganisation, undo files are created (rev????.dat), which contain the data necessary to undo block connections.\n\nBlock pruning itself is not yet implemented, but this makes it trivial to do so; all that is required is deleting old block and undo files when certain thresholds are reached. Also note that this block pruning mechanism is different from the transaction pruning mechanism described by Satoshi. This one does not prevent a node from acting as a full node.\n\nAll commits result in a functional code tree, with succeeding unit tests. The first few add some extra classes, without changing actual semantics. \"One file per block\" and \"Multiple blocks per file\" form a refactor of the block storage mechanism, with related database changes. \"Do not store hashNext on disk\" only introduces a forward-incompatible change that simplifies the database layout. \"Ultraprune\" itself contains the switch from txindex.dat to coins.dat as validation data, and contains the majority of the changes. What follows are optimizations and other some improvements, that do not effect compatibility.\n\nThere are a few TODO's left (see comment below), but I'd like to give the code some exposure already.",
