It is confusing and error-prone that the command set used for the entire wallet, and that for the individual accounts overlaps.\n\nI also think that the account system can be deprecated completely when we have full multi-wallet support (and expose it on JSON-RPC, for example by distinguishing the wallet used based on HTTP username). Otherwise it will become very complex, with two levels of nesting.\n\nThen again; many clients rely on the current behavior. Changing it will require multiple deprecation steps over a long time. Maybe something for the \"1.0.0\" roadmap.\n",
