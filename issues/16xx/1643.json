That's a 4045% charge.  [According to the user](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=77870.msg1071052#msg1071052), there were \"a lot of better fitting inputs\".\n\nThe coin selection code doesn't attempt to minimise fees.  Perhaps it should.\n\nThe transaction spent the following outputs:\n\n571 single satoshis, plus these 15 amounts which sum to 0.05559429:\n\n0.00007550 0.00009679 0.00011887 0.00014177 0.00019014\n0.00042293 0.00045708 0.00049249 0.00056730 0.00134063\n0.00178897 0.00187366 0.00196149 0.01070019 0.03536648\n\nIf just the last of those 15 was used, the fee would have been either 0.0005 or 0.",
