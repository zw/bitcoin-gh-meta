   "body" : "I've investigated issue #1462 and in my experiments, the memory allocation pattern with a many transient objects almost guarantees that after the initialization of bitcoin **only one** of the pages is actually locked. This means that most of the keying material can end up in swap.\n\nI considered two ways to address this:\n1) A special memory pool (using boost::pool) of locked pages\n2) Keep track of which pages are locked with a lock count\n\nI first tried (1), but it ended up non-optimal. boost::pool is very wasteful with tiny objects (in this case, char), as the minimum chunk size seems to be the pointer size, resulting in a blow-up of 8ÃÂ on 64 bit architectures. As locked pages are a limited resource, this should be avoided.\n\nSo I went with the second alternative. This solution is also easier to test than a full-blown custom memory pool. I've added an autotester.\n",
