   "body" : "This PR implements https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/803 -- Signet support.\r\n\r\nSignet is a proposed new type of test network that requires a signature in the blocks. While this kind of network is centralized, it allows for properties that are desirable in a test network, which testnet alone cannot provide.\r\n\r\nSignet has a default global testnet baked in for easy usage, but is built around the concept of there being multiple simultaneous signets. Someone is already working on a signet with bip-taproot etc patched on top of it. When new features are tested globally, starting a temporary signet for that purpose is trivial.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet\r\n\r\nNoteworthy:\r\n* proof of work check now skips genesis block for all networks, including mainnet\r\n* the `TestBlockValidity` function drops the redundant prev index argument and instead uses the chain tip\r\n* a new global \"is signet\" flag is added, which affects consensus: it adds a new enforcement that all blocks must have a valid signature for the \"signet block script\", a global script\r\n* `DecodeHexBlk` will now attempt to load the block data from a file whose filename is the hex string argument, if it turns out to not be a valid hex string; this has the odd caveat of the relative directory being relative to the execution of `bitcoind`, not `bitcoin-cli` (see `contrib/signet/mkblock.sh`)\r\n",
