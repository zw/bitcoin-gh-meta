      "body" : "Since this seems to only be an issue when the home directory is chosen as the custom data-dir I think the easiest \"catch-all\" solution is to add some kind of hint along with the custom data-dir option. Something like \"This may require additional permissions depending on the location you choose and your operating system.\" Given that users could choose any kind of obscure location for their data dir (like the actual contacts folder) I think there will always be a chance that users are prompted for additional permissions. On the other hand, Contacts/Calendars will still be confusing to some people because they don't think of them as folders in their file system. But for those users, the only further help I can think of is adding install notes or an faq entry somewhere easy to find, something along the lines of the atom forum post.\r\n\r\nI am not a macOS developer but since the IDE developers have not brought up this solution I suspect there is no way to generally exclude access to specific subfolders on the system, which would be the cleanest solution, of course.",
