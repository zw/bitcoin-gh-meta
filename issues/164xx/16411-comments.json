Since Testnet has been used at some points to scam people out of money, I could see how this could be used in a similar way. However, with something like this it would be easier for someone to create a signet and give it value (aka use it to create a permission-ed altcoin and mooch 100% off Bitcoin Core development. At least with current altcoin, they have a \"keep up to date with merging Core patches\" barrier of entry... this would not have such a barrier.)\r\n2. I would say no. But that would need more in-depth technical review.\r\n3. If scams run rampant in my scenario in number 1, some people might propose hard coding blacklists that will require scammers to maintain patches removing themselves from the signet blacklist etc... But other than that, I don't see much problem.\r\n\r\nI am leaning towards concept ACK. But I am slightly concerned about someone abusing this like testnet has been abused in the past, and how signet's differences make those abuses easier or harder.",

Does adding this somehow hurt Bitcoin's code base?\r\n\r\nThere is a tiny amount of risk involved as it touches consensus validation code, but this is a tiny code change.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason someone managed to flip the \"signet\" flag on a running node, for example, that would cause those nodes to start rejecting bitcoin blocks. I don't foresee this as very likely, personally.\r\n\r\n>     3. Does adding this require some long term maintenance / increase the weight on devs for support in the future?\r\n\r\nYes, same as adding any feature to a system. I assume the point of your question is if the added maintenance is worth it; in my opinion it is. Signet is fairly self-contained (3 main parts: signet, wallet RPC, miner RPC, and some sprinkled stuff; there are also the contrib/signet scripts but I see those as irrelevant in this case as they're not a part of the C++ codebase), so it shouldn't be that hard to maintain.\r\n\r\n>     4. Since Testnet has been used at some points to scam people out of money, I could see how this could be used in a similar way. However, with something like this it would be easier for someone to create a signet and give it value (aka use it to create a permission-ed altcoin and mooch 100% off Bitcoin Core development. At least with current altcoin, they have a \"keep up to date with merging Core patches\" barrier of entry... this would not have such a barrier.)\r\n\r\nI don't think this is an issue, to be honest. People can already copy the codebase and tweak it to make a new coin, or start up a regtest and ask their victim to connect to it using This Special Bitcoin.conf File [tm] which so happens to have regtest=1 in it.\r\n",

Just tell the victims to download Bitcoin Core. And it works out of the box (with a conf tweak)...\r\n\r\nSo while the risk is super low, it is objectively higher than regtest and testnet...\r\n\r\nThat being said. The benefit is great compared to that risk. Which, again, is why I say \"leaning towards concept ACK.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be very powerful to have someone who already has Bitcoin Core downloaded and running to spin up another instance with some args that lets them try out taproot etc etc...",

Is unvetted \"people rewriting the blockchain at their whim by mining a ton of blocks\" a common problem? It wouldn't be a problem for a training workshop (just spin up a new one) but could possibly be for a project building on top of regtest.\r\n\r\nAlso any other key differences between design of regtest and signet? I don't need convincing of signet's upsides in comparison to testnet but not convinced re regtest versus signet. Digging into understanding regtest code a bit more but any guidance would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI've opened up a [Stack Exchange page](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/89640/what-are-the-key-differences-between-regtest-and-the-proposed-signet) for this question so probably better to move answers there.",

      "body" : "So I discussed with @kallewoof I don't like the fact that `generatetoaddress` does not work on custom signets.\r\nThe reason why `generatetoaddress` does not work on signet is that signet need blocks to be signed, and right now it uses the bitcoin wallet to find the keys. However `generatetoaddress` can't depends on wallet code.\r\n\r\nNow we have three ways of fixing the problem:\r\n1. Passing the keys for signing on signet via command line `--signet_privatekey` (My preference)\r\n2. Passing the keys to `generatetoaddress` (@kallewoof preference)\r\n3. We don't care for this PR.\r\n\r\nI don't like 2, because it does not solve my initial problem: to have a custom signet just work with the same code you would use for regtest.\r\n\r\n@kallewoof does not like my preference, because he says passing private keys via command line is bad practice. Personally, I don't think this is a problem because custom signet coins have no value, so no damage can be done.",

But philosophical questions aside, the changes in the consensus code are quite simple and innocuous.\r\nNot the way they're written in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16630 though, for it has a performance penalty for other valid blocks. The way it is written in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9102 there's no performance penalty at all unless the block is invalid, which I think it's fine, since the penalty should be small anyway, I haven't benchmarked it but it's just comparing 2 hashes right before logging an error.\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant, but I really dislike the -signet_nonce argument.\r\nSee https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/pull/9/commits/010cca031dfb890f92ff78c3bf6a45326ae38edf",
