Because if one is done under the old style, and then is spent and the spend validates (but won't validate under the fix) the behavior will become unfixable. Or unfixable without hacks. \r\n\r\nLuke asserted that it's already unfixable:  If it's fixed, then at any time someone can produce either the old or the new style and the chain will irreparably split for old and new clients. Even if the new one becomes longer, the split will remain because the two interpretations of the signature are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nI didn't have a really good answer to thisÃ¢ÂÂ it sounds right to me. Is there any way to fix this that doesn't create a split hazard?  ... other than perhaps a hack that specifies the old behavior until some sufficiently far future block number, and the new behavior after it, so that enough clients can be updated before the flag day that an intentionally triggered split isn't an issue. (and, hopefully none of the old style make it into the chain before the flag day, so that the legacy code can simply be dropped once the flag day is sufficiently buried)\r\n",
