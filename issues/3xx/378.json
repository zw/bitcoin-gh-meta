Additionally, if a wallet\r\ngets corrupted, the client should always fail to load the wallet\r\nto give the user a chance for manual recovery.\r\n\r\nThis needs to go into 0.3.24, so that users who downgrade don't mess up their wallet by adding unencrypted keys to an encrypted wallet, making all versions unable to use the wallet.",
