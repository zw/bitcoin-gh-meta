On a subsequent test run I had an infinite loop of the exception being caught and retrying.  I had 3 \"defunct\" python subprocesses that were hanging around, and no idea why that was the case.  Maybe either a python subprocess bug, or an OS bug?\r\n\r\nI did stumble across something that made me wonder if there's an [issue with our use of subprocess.PIPE](https://thraxil.org/users/anders/posts/2008/03/13/Subprocess-Hanging-PIPE-is-your-enemy/) but I haven't done enough investigation at this point to identify that as the problem (and in fact I don't yet have a good hypothesis as to how that could be the problem here, either).\r\n\r\nI did identify two workarounds that appear to work for me:\r\n * Commented out wallet-dump.py from rpc-tests.py, and changed my test invocation so that I first run rpc-tests.py and then separately ran wallet-dump.py.  \r\n * Change test invocation to just run rpc-tests.py -parallel=2\r\n\r\nBoth of these seem to never trigger the exception for me; I'm using the second workaround for now and will monitor.\r\n\r\nLeaving this issue open as I still don't understand the underlying issue here.",
