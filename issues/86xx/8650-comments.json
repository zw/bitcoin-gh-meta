We can't use Marco's compatibility fix that he emailed me because it is macro-unhygenic\r\n1. I could just rip the boost macros and replace them with a patched, lighter weight version.\r\n1. I could just entirely replace boost unit testing and we can not care about preserving functionality completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that 4. is probably the best option longer term.",
