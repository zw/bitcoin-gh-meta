      "body" : "> [...] Whenever a key from the keypool is used in a received transaction, we should automatically mark it as used, and if possible replenish.\r\n\r\nI agree, we should do this. We already replenish the keypool after getting a key from the pool, though only in unencrypted wallets.\r\n\r\n**But I see significant issues regarding implementation of a \"gap limit\".**\r\nLets assume we would follow the BIP44 gap limit of 20 keys and someone does a restore of a HD wallet.dat backup created right after the creation of the wallet. We assume the seed in this wallet had received and sent plenty of transactions.\r\n\r\nIf we would reconstruct the transactions with a gap limit of 20, it would require plenty of rescans down to the blockheight where BIP32 was introduced (or down to the merge date of #8035). Performs utterly bad in conjunctions with pruning.\r\n\r\nAnd if a user could wait a couple of days (could easily happen with a 1000tx+ wallet) until this process has completed, there are serious risks that some funds could not be reconstructed.\r\n\r\nI guess we can also assume, if someone recovers from a backup, he or she very likely are going to sweep his funds to a new wallet (security aspect). **Failed reconstruction of keys can result in permanent loss**.\r\n\r\nWhat if she or he had call more the twenty times `getnewaddress` without actually giving away these addresses but afterwards gave away some of the 20+ addresses which then had been used to receive coins (or maybe someone did click 20+ times on \"receive coins\" in the GUI).\r\n\r\nI think we should clearly distinct between \"import/reconstruct\" and \"normal operation\". It doesn't hurt if we check against the keypool when we receive a transaction. But in general, the wallet does well know, when it did generate a seed and when it did use an existing, imported seed in order to generate the keypool.\r\n\r\nImporting should result in a custom process to avoid lost funds. Also, we should and probably must ask the user for some additional information and warn him appropriately.\r\nMost users think restoring a wallet with a seed/xpriv will \"reconstruct everything\". What if they have used the seed in a different wallet using a different derivation scheme (like BIP44). They naively going to assume that these funds will be reconstructed and maybe sweep to a new wallet and throw away the \"old backup\".\r\n\r\nTLTR?\r\n1) I think we should clearly distinct between import/recover and normal operations.\r\n2) We must warn/inform users when reconstructing fund for possible missed keys.\r\n3) We should ask the user for some basic informations about the wallet size (gap limit) in order to reconstruct faster.\r\n4) Reconstruction should result in using very large (1000+) lookup-windows and large gap limits, we should release(remove) the unused keys minus the gap limit at the upper end afterwards",
