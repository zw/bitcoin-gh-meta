I think that also has a better chance of being read than a README file in the zip, the concept of a plain text README file is pretty weird to non-programmers.

But, here are some arguments against that move:\r\n- `.dmg` is still the dominant format for distributing application on the macOS platform. It offers instant assurance that the application I just downloaded is a `macOS` specific application. Receiving a `.zip` may cast some level of doubt, as in: Did the server mess up and feed me a Windows application in a `.zip`\r\n- It sucks that Apple always chooses to do it's own thing instead of adopting industry standards, but `.dmg` is still the standard and we should continue to use it for the foreseeable future since it is still what people expect.\r\n\r\n",
