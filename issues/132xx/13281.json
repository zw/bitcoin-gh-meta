(Motivated by my opinion that the dev tools are mostly for generating code and updating the repo whereas the linters are read-only checks.)\r\n\r\nAlso, adds a readme to clarify that checks and linters are only meant to prevent bugs and user facing issues, not merely stylistic preference or inconsistencies. (This is motivated by the diversity in developers and work flows as well as existing code styles. It would be too disruptive to change all existing code to a single style or too burdensome to force all developers to adhere to a single style. Also note that our style guide is changing, so locking in at the wrong style \"too early\" would only waste resources.)",
