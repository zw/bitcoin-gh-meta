   "body" : "There were a few test cases in SelectCoinsBnB testing that did not properly address the code under test:\r\n\r\n* Negative effective value test did not trigger the condition so was redundant with basic value selection tests. Note I switched from `assert` to `throw` in order to make this condition testable.\r\n* early bailout optimization tests did not test the actual selection because their utxo pool was polluted by the `make_hard_case` test preceding.\r\n* None of the tests asserted on the value_ret output value. This output is very relevant to sanity checks and more informative in the case of failures where the returned value has changed, because `equal_sets` does not provide information on its failure.\r\n",
