   "body" : "This PR replaces nonces in two places with pre-salted hashers.\r\n\r\nThe nonce is chosen to be 64 bytes long so that it forces the SHA256 hasher to process the chunk. This leaves the next 64 (or 56 depending if final chunk) open for data. In the case of the script execution cache, this does not make a big performance improvement because the nonce was already properly padded to fit into one buffer, but does make the code a little simpler. In the case of the sig cache, this should reduce the hashing overhead slightly because we are less likely to need an additional processing step.\r\n\r\nI haven't benchmarked this, but back of the envelope it should reduce the hashing by one buffer for all combinations except compressed public keys with compact signatures.",
