This certainly solves the main issue I'm interested in, which is the manual ordering in the list.\r\n\r\nI currently don't have time (nor do I want to step on your toes here) to implement the full set of metadata mentioned in #11964, though.  So I would only include the rough runtime in the tests to make the order automatic (i. e., the order in `test_runner.py` itself won't matter and can be based on logical relation of tests rather than runtime).  I would not implement the full set of metadata to get rid of the list completely for now.

However, as far as I can see your comment relates only to point 1) of my original report.  I believe that point 2) is actually the important part (perhaps that was not made very clear):  **I want to get rid of the requirement to have tests in order in the code, at least roughly.**  Instead, the code should be mainly written for us developers, and should be in an order that makes sense from a logical point of view.\r\n\r\nSo if you (and others) believe that solving point 1) in addition is not worth the complication of the auto-generated list, my proposal is to solve just point 2) by manually including (approximate) test runtimes somewhere - for instance, by a limited implementation of metadata in tests as suggested by #11964 (where the metadata is for now just the test runtime, so that `test_runners.py` can sort on the fly before running the tests).  What do you think about this proposal?",

Also, having metadata in the tests themselves seems to be what we are going to anyway with #11964 at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, again, my goal is not to reduce the maintenance overhead of keeping the current list sorted.  I want to get rid of the constraint that it has to be sorted, and thus allow reordering it in a more readable and logical way.  That's what I want to solve here - if you think this is a non-goal (I disagree, for readability reasons of the code), then of course this proposal is not useful.",
