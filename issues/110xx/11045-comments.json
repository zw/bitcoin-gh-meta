In addition to avoid confusing the fuzzer (unnecessary re-use of fuzzing inputs between the fuzzers - just confirmed by @kcc! :-)) it has the benefit of making it more obvious when a given fuzzing session has reached a state where no new paths are found.\r\n\r\nWith the current \"first part of input data chooses the fuzzer\"-approach taken by `test_bitcoin_fuzzy` it is quite hard to see which fuzzers that are still hitting new paths (i.e. keep fuzzing!), and which have reached their max depth/\"max path count\" (i.e. consider stop fuzzing).\r\n\r\n+1 for splitting the fuzzers into one binary each\r\n\r\nGiven a one-binary-per-fuzzer setup it would be quite trivial to write a script that gives each fuzzer a running time of X time units each, and then measures the achieved coverage. Having this kind of fuzzer shootout would be quite fun and will probably increase the interest in writing Bitcoin fuzzers!\r\n\r\nAlso it would make it easy to measure the _incremental_ coverage gained from adding a new fuzzer which would be handy during fuzzing development.",

      "body" : "Hey @Dor1s great response.  I read a bit more about AFL specifically and gmaxwell's response is starting to make a bit more sense.  AFL suffers from a hash collision problem in the 64Kb shared_mem array (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt) and I'm wondering if that is also another motivation to remove this one-fuzzer-for-all approach?  But it seems that getting rid of, say, ~20 edges/branches wouldn't really mitigate this problem at all if the execution traces are particularly deep (i.e. have lots of edges and therefore a potential for collision).  Removing the switch specifically to avoid collision doesn't seem to be much of a motivation - the real motivation would be to avoid confusing the fuzzer with erroneous feedback that's applied to the wrong messages.  What do you think?",
