Not that git is usually smart enough to figure out filename only changes, so rebasing shouldn't be an issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the functional tests to have a consistent naming scheme:\r\n\r\n- tests for individual RPC methods are named `rpc_...`\r\n- tests for interfaces (REST, ZMQ, RPC features) are named `interface_...`\r\n- tests that explicitly test the p2p interface are named `p2p_...`\r\n- tests for wallet features are named `wallet_...`\r\n- tests for mining features are named `mining_...`\r\n- tests for mempool behaviour are named `mempool_...`\r\n- tests for full features that aren't wallet/mining/mempool are named `feature_...`\r\n\r\nRationale: it's sometimes difficult for new contributors to know what's already covered by existing tests and where new tests should be added. Naming in a consistent fashion makes it easier to see what's already covered at a glance.",
