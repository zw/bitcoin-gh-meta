Collectively these result in much more code coverage than ```src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp``` but are not exhaustive (yet).\r\n\r\nI could not find any issues despite running the fuzzers for a long time.\r\n\r\nIf you want it, I'll make a pull request. I'm also willing to work together with someone who has more intimate knowledge of the Bitcoin core source code to complement the current set of fuzzers.\r\n",
