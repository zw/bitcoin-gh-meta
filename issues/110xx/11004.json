   "body" : "This is a request to change how the Travis job is configured for Bitcoin. I'd submit a PR to do this myself, but the change can only be made by someone who has Travis configuration permissions for the bitcoin repo.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nCurrently there are a number of static-analysis style checks that are run in Travis, guarded by the `CHECK_DOC` environment variable. This variable is only set for the first test runner (the arm-linux-gnueabihf host), so the checks are only run once. All of these checks run very fast, and do not require building Bitcoin or running the regular C++/Python tests.\r\n\r\n## Request\r\n\r\nConfigure a new Travis job that runs against PRs, and only runs the `CHECK_DOC` tests. At the same time, the `CHECK_DOC` stuff in the existing job would be removed.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nCreating a separate Travis job for these tests would be an improvement because:\r\n * It would be more immediately obvious that a `CHECK_DOC` failure is related to one of the check scripts; currently it's confusing to new contributors (e.g. me) to see an ARM failure, when the failure is not actually related to any new architecture-specific code.\r\n * The job would either pass quickly or fail quickly, giving faster feedback to developers who submit PRs.\r\n * The main `.travis.yml` file in the repo could be cleaned up, by removing the `CHECK_DOC` guards in the `before_script` and `script` sections.",
