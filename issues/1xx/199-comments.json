If you only want transactions with six confirmations or more, you call \"listsinceblock (block-id) 6\" and all of the recent transactions with 6+ confirmations would be reported.  The \"lastblock\" property on the result object would then contain the hash of the sixth most recent block instead of the most recent.  This way, when you run the command later, transactions that had under 6 confirmations last time will be reported if they have 6+ now.",

The default of 1 will return the latest block ID, while 2 will return the second-latest block ID, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe command now outputs transactions with zero confirmations in addition to those in the newer blocks so that applications can act on them in some way, such as show them as pending in a UI.\r\n\r\nNote that the second parameter **does not** in any way affect which transactions are returned; if you only care about transactions with N confirms, you will pass N as the second parameter, and then filter the results down to only those with N+ confirmations.  This will ensure that the next time you run the command with the new lastblock value you won't miss any transactions that have now reached N confirmations.  But it will allow applications that want to specially handle transactions with <N confirmations to do so as well.  So this command neatly hits both use-cases.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I've also rebased against master.",
