Selects correct architecture (64 bit or 32 bit) and runs the right version of Bitcoin.\r\nShould be placed in the top level dir during release.\r\n\r\nAdded in argument passing. I closed old pull request, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/104\r\n\r\nSee http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3904.0\r\n\r\nI think for release you should offer 2 downloads (like Ubuntu does):\r\nThe default Linux release marked as 'Bitcoin (Recommended)' and the 64 bit version 'Bitcoin 64 bit'. Nice and simple. So feel free to close this pull request as long as dual release packages are agreed upon.\r\n\r\nPut bitcoin in the top level directory. Hide bitcoind in a subdirectory. The current release layout is very confusing for new users.\r\n",
