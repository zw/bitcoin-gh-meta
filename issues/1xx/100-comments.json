I'm not exactly sure how this thing works, seeing as I haven't cloned it yet, but I'd assume that there's a way to check which language they are compiling/using. (I'm thinking #ifdef GERMAN blabla #endif, or something of the sort.) Seeing as Microsoft Excel doesn't prompt the user which to use and guesses based on language (unlike OpenOffice <3) this would have to be implanted. And as a final note, some language versions of Excel don't play nice with Unicode.",

You can just use . as decimal and , as record separator, and anyone who wishes to change it can just do a search-replace with a text editor. \n\nI think it's far better to support such a thing. It's rather unfriendly to tell all non-English users to just go into a text editor and go do it themselves. If you want to have a currency, especially one spanning across multiple countries, user friendliness and making it work in as many places as possible is a must.\n\n>sneak:\n>CSV is not necessarily intended to be human readable.\n\nThat's the problem, it is. If the specification was just \"use . for a decimal separator,\" there'd be no problem. The problem is some people said \"hey, we want , for the decimal separator,\" so they did. \n\n>sneak:\n>Europeans writing floats in source code use the period as a decimal, because that's the spec.\n\nBut why not the other way around? Wouldn't *you* be confused if you had to code in a language that used , as the decimal separator and period as the argument separator? Eventually, you'd probably be able to understand it, correct? The real problem is that although *humans* would understand it, programs that load CSV may not.\n\nOverall, I really have to say that it matters little, but I'd be really annoyed if I had to do more than my fair share just because a couple of people were too lazy to allow me to select what I want.

Of course it would be nice to have a fancy interface to customize export settings, but I think just couple of lines in ini-file would be enough. And the simplest locale-independend solution would be a tab separated file with integer representation of bitcoins (bitcoins*1e8).",
