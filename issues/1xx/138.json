They are reported just like mature blocks, except the category is 'immature' instead of 'generate'.\n\nThis functionality is needed by people creating alternative, JSON-RPC-based GUIs, and is useful for impatient miners who currently grep through debug.log or use unofficial patches to see not-yet-mature blocks they've generated.",
