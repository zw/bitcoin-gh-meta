   "body" : "This commit adds a \"listsinceblock\" RPC command that will accept a block hash and list all of the wallet transactions that have occurred after that block.  If no block is specified, it will list all wallet transactions.  The output also includes the block ID of the latest block on the main chain.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to simplify the process of reconciling transactions it bitcoind with another database; you store the most recent block you have seen (the \"latest block\" result from your last reconcile) and, on the next reconcile pass this block identifier.  bitcoind will then tell you about all the transactions you need to process (possibly including transactions you have already processed, if the latest block the last time you reconciled has since been orphaned).",
