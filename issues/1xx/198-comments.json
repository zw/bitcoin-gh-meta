Would be nice to write some tests to exercise those edge cases, and figure out what it SHOULD do in those cases.",

If that's not what you want, the call to monitorBlock() should go in CBlock::ConnectBlock() (called for each block that's being added to the main chain).\r\n\r\nDependent transactions are only used for self-created transactions, so that isn't an issue I believe.\r\n\r\nAlso, if monitortx is only for your own transactions, i believe its list of listeners should go in CWallet (at least for now), and the callback in CWallet::AddToWallet(). I intended the dispatch functions in main.cpp (incl. SyncWithWallets) to be replacable with a generic listener system one day, so i prefer them not to contain any real logic.\r\n",
