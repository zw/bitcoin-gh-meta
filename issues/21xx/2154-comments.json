ACK 90% of it, modulo inline comments made earlier.\r\n\r\nOne specific criticism with this rebase:  the rebase problems were all fixed in a final, appended commit.  That does not work, because it breaks bisection properties.  Each commit needs to produce a tree that is buildable and passes tests.  Otherwise, \"git bisect\" will not work, and attempting to find a problematic commit in past history becomes more difficult.\r\n\r\nI know that makes rebasing more difficult for changes like this, sorry :(\r\n\r\nWe cannot have:  broken commit, broken commit, broken commit, commit that fixes everything.\r\n",

They are there to break the dependency of net on main, and seen as such it seems perhaps weird, if the only user of net is main for now.\r\n\r\nHowever, over time, net should turn into a class \"CNetworkNode\" or something, which exposes a way to listen for events. I suppose a boost::signal could be used right now instead, which more clearly shows its intention.\r\n\r\nAnd please, the overhead of a pointer indirection is few orders of magnitude lower than even just allocating the buffer in which a message being processed is read...",
