Which to any users is just a string of random letters and numbers; It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean a thing to a non-technical person.  I realise that sha256 doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have any (known or mathematically computed) collisions but to a non-technical person that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean anything, so with this social engineering flaw in mind we can assume any joe-shmoe can invent his own \"predictable digest\" or even just provide a base64 encoding of the message the non-technical user wouldn't know a thing of the difference and could agree to things they are unaware of. I don't know where we need to go to further this discussion the possibilities of this issue, shall I open it up in the forums?",
