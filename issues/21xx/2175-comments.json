The other solution (to update counting etc.) would be much more effort and could create other problems IMHO.\r\n\r\n@laanwj It's a little weird to me, I have a testnet wallet, which shows 15 tx on overviewpage, 12 are displayed in the tx list and listtransactions \"\" 100 gives me 18 tx.\r\n\r\nEdit: Seems I found out what the reason for this is. I have 3 tx, where I sent coins to an address in my testnet wallet (from and to is the same), which creates a send and an receive tx, which both have the same tx ID. Also orphaned transactions are not shown in the tx list, but via the listtransactions RPC command.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: I would suggest to move the label from overviewpage to debug window and make it read ``unique transaction IDs`` with a help message ``Total number of unique transaction IDs in wallet``. What about that?",
