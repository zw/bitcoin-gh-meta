I'm going to be using this functionality for an upcoming new version of [Coinpunk](http://coinpunk.org), to support client-side encryption for private keys, so that `bitcoind` becomes a listener, and cannot spend any of the user's money. This is a huge linchpin in my new version, and it enables this capability for people developing web services and offline clients that use a central `bitcoind` instance to keep up with the blockchain while they are offline. And of course cold storage wallets that generate the private keys on their own end.\r\n\r\nI won't be able to release the new Coinpunk until this is released, so it would be amazing if this commit could get into the next release. I don't think it's too dangerous, just because I believe it's not handling anything that could potentially lose bitcoins, but I could be mistaken. But it would be awesome.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can help in any way. Thanks, you guys are awesome. :-)",

Since bitcoind is not going to access the keys anyway while they're encrypted, it shouldn't matter that they're actually zeros. So that will effectively produce watch-only addresses. However, it still wouldn't be possible to add new watch-only addresses via rpc, which this patch can do.\r\n\r\nBy the way, could a slightly cleaner implementation of this be to store watch-only addresses as normal keys (except where the encrypted private key is cleared) instead of adding the new \"address\" data type in the walletdb?",
