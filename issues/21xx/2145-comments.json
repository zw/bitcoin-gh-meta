However, how meaningful is it to check undo data without checking the coin state - there is no scenario in which you need undo data but not coin state.\r\n\r\nIn way, the system is backwards. The coin state is by far the most important thing to verify, but unfortunately it is also almost the most expensive, and it already requires consistent blocks and undo data.\r\n\r\nRegarding only checking very few with low dbcache... what would you suggest?\r\n\r\nAlso, the calculation for memory sizes based on transaction counts is only very approximately and spread over several types of caches (leveldb blktree, leveldb coindb, coins view cache). Doing the rollback pulls the transaction data in the global cache, and then changes to it in a memory-only cache on top of it, that is discarded. The transactions themself remain in the global cache though, afterwards.",

This means that if dbcache is set small, we may not discover corrupted undo data which could be trivially discovered, until a reorg.\r\n\r\nFor small dbcache valuesÃ¢ÂÂ we could give it a minimum value... or could make it always some reasonable number even if we go over our coincachesize limit?\r\n\r\nI really wish there were a way to randomly test the coins database as I expect the leveldb disk layout probably ends up with old and new data being exposed to different errors. Oh well.\r\n\r\nIn any case, tested with fuzzed undo (with and without undo checksums) and coins data. It's quite sensitive to errors.\r\n\r\nAfter running it some with a corrupted leveldb and corrupted undos, after restoring the non-corrupted files, I'm getting \r\n\r\n2013-01-04 07:09:47 ERROR: DisconnectBlock() : block and undo data inconsistent\r\n2013-01-04 07:09:47 ERROR: VerifyDB() : *** irrecoverable inconsistency in block data\r\n\r\nSo either I screwed up, or the corruption was somehow propagated to other files. I note that many of the error messages are repeated, so I can't easily tell which test failed. If giving them distinct messages is too much work, perhaps just slipping in __FILE__ and __LINE__ would be helpful. (though this isn't an issue in the codebase unique to the checking pull)\r\n\r\n",
