I immediately started mining using -gen=1\r\n\r\nI noticed the number of transactions going up by 1, but there was no transaction showing up. This might be related to coinbase tx which tend to show up later than I would expect them to.\r\n\r\nEven now, the wallet says 38 tx but if I count right its only 35.\r\n",
