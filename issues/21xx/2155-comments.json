Checking for that is a good idea:  \"information about the precision and internal representation of floating point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in sys.float_info.\"\r\n\r\n... or maybe more straightforward (and more easily portable to other languages) would be a check routine that takes Decimal(\"20000000.00000003\"), converts it to float, json encode/decode, and makes sure precision is not lost in the round-trip.\r\n\r\nmmm, yeah, json encode/decode definitely better, because the json float encoder might decide to round/truncate...",
