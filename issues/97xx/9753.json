   "body" : "Using VARINT with signed types is dangerous because negative values will appear to serialize correctly, but then deserialize as positive values mod 128.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the VARINT macro to trigger a compile error by default if called with an signed value, and it updates existing broken uses of VARINT to pass a special flag that lets them keep working with no changes in behavior.\r\n\r\nThere is some discussion about this issue here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9693#issuecomment-278701473. I think another good change along these lines would be to make `GetSizeOfVarInt` and `WriteVarInt` throw exceptions if they are passed numbers less than 0 to serialize. But unlike this change, that would be a change in runtime behavior, and need more consideration.",
