This will take a while and temporarily take up a lot of disk space, however if it works on your system you can avoid that by using this [fastcopy_chaindata](https://gist.github.com/laanwj/3c4614a23e072cbb3d39090da1834a68) script, which will hardlink files that can be safely hardlinked (as they don't change) and copy the rest of the files relevant to the chaindata.\r\n\r\n- In the copied data directory, enable pruning. Start bitcoind on the copied data directory to make the pruning happen. The result will be a smaller data directory.\r\n\r\n- Copy this pruned data directory to your target.\r\n\r\nI've used this in practice to bootstrap nodes running on comparatively low-end ARM hardware.\r\n",
