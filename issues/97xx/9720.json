As discussed with @TheBlueMatt and @gmaxwell.\r\n\r\nFixes for a few problems discovered while running a network stress/fuzzer:\r\n- Remote nodes weren't always banned when they hadn't yet sent a verack. Regression from 7a8c2519015650acd51eaf42719f04e53f839bbe.\r\n- Require a verack before sending any non-handshake messages. This is much more straightforward behavior, and allows for tests to be easily written\r\n- Now that there's a sane model for testing, add checks for leaky messages sent out before the handshake is complete, as well as for banning in those cases.",
