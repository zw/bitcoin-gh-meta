It's looking like Apple is moving to make 10.9 the new minimum dev requirement as quickly as possible, and I want to be sure we're ready for that. I've got the cross and native build up and running with recent clang and 10.9 sdk (still 10.6 minimum runtime, so no user-facing changes other than better functionality on newer OSs).\r\n\r\nPoint being: when we're looking to bump up our minimum required dev environment, I have no problem dropping these kind of compat workarounds.
