This\nchange ensures that the proper plist files and symlinks are present prior to\npackaging.\n\nI believe I've tested this on all of my build scenarios, including the future static qt.\n\n@gavinandresen Please give this a real-world try (preferably by merging it into -rc1 locally and signing a gitian build there as though it were rc2) before ACKing. It worksforme (tm), but that means very little for Apple's tools.\n\nAlso, note that --deep will be needed for codesign until we switch to static libs.\n",
