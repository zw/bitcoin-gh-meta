      "body" : "Gitian doesn't manage the dependency cache, it blindly copies the result of the build. So if the build nukes the cache, it's gone (see huge caveat below, this is completely untrue in practice). Currently the dependency builder removes everything but the most recent result for each dependency, so that it can be used by set-and-forget systems without worry of disks filling up.\r\n\r\nHuge caveat: Gitian uses scp to xfer the build cache back to the bare-metal builder. If a file is deleted in the cache, when the dir is scp'd back to the bare-metal, all left-over files still remain there. This would be solved by using something like \"rsync --delete\" instead of scp, but I'm not sure that is the most reasonable behavior.\r\n\r\nSo the actual answer is: all built dependencies are saved until they're manually deleted. The cache can be safely purged at any time. So if you're bouncing back and forth between branches, both cached versions will be preserved.",

It's very flaky with newer compilers and requires lots of patching. If 4.6 turns out to be required I can go that route.\r\n\r\nI elected instead to go with 4.8 and hook up a back-compat option for qt, similar to what we have with glibc. For now, I'd like to avoid any bikeshedding on the option itself and how its implemented, and just focus on whether or not it actually works. I haven't tested yet on a distro with an old 4.6 or 4.8.\r\n\r\nIf it _does_ work, it would be a big advantage because it wouldn't require gitian builds to test release-version behavior, it would only need a configure switch.\r\n\r\nEdit: I meant we should avoid discussing the semantics of the configure switch itself. Arguing the code implementation is fair game.",
