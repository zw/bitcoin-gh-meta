It hides dependencies between modules, and may cause breaking in case of reorganizations that change types. As far as I'm concerned, the most important thing (and the only thing worth doing refactoring effort to obtain) is dependencies between modules, where a module is defined as the combination of the .h and .cpp file. You can't use the .h file without the .cpp file (typically), so including the .h file means you're depending on that code.\r\n\r\nMoving CTxDestination to a place where it makes no sense semantically (scripts, and their identifiers, are much higher level constructs than keys) is IMHO a bad idea, but if the only goal is dropping an #include (without even breaking a module dependency), it's unacceptable.",
