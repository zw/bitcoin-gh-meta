   "body" : "Right now the blockchain is one solid file. I would like to make the suggestion to have an option that allows separation of the blockchain into multiple files that have a smaller footprint individually. This would allow developers to use services like S3 cloud storage to host the blockchain. S3 has the main issue of having a 5GB max filesize. Storage is a very expensive commodity in dedicated servers and VPS systems.\r\n\r\nthe increasing blockchain size is becoming an issue for a lot of people who want to integrate bitcoin into their website. \r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that having this option will provide a more future proof development support system.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
