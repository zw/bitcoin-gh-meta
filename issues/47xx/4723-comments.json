Then the rotation process could protect the peer with the most recent block accepted time.\r\n\r\nI'm also concerned about partitioning attacks, keeping up long term connections means no late coming partition attack can be successful (without first dos attacking off the rest of the network). So I think we should at a minimum protect our three oldest \"working\" outbound connections, and not just bias the selection against them. (Three because anything smaller is guaranteed to give a degenerate topology assuming our other connections are sybils)\r\n\r\nDoes someone have a simulation of the deanonymization attacks so we can estimate how much connection persistence can be tolerated before rotation is ineffective?\r\n",

He also connects to every other available listening peer and fills up their inbound capacity (this is a fairly cheap attack).\r\n\r\nIn the current network this kind of activity would only disrupt newly joining peers, but nodes which were still online would remain connected to each other.  With excessive rotation the entire network could become connected exclusively via the sybils.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if an attacker is able to partition a large miner they can eliminate their hash-power from competition or even use it to perform double spending attacks against partitioned merchants; so there is an economic motivation for these sorts of attacks.",
