The problem is that the outcome of this test is a race because node 1 is downloading the blocks from node 0 in the background.

We try to avoid tests where the outcome is not 100% reliable because we are seeing intermittent test failures quite often already.\r\n\r\nWhat would be needed is a reliable way to let node 1 sync the headers but then prevent it from syncing the blocks.

But you are connecting the nodes in your test here: `self.connect_nodes(0, 1)`. In the moment the nodes are connected they also start syncing. You can see this for example by inserting `print(self.nodes[1].getblockcount())` in the line before your first assert and then running the test a couple of times. You will see that the node is not at 200 blocks anymore and each time you run the test it will be a different number because of this race between the different processes.\r\n\r\n> I thought the first `getblockfrompeer` into the assert would fail because I didn't setup it to sync blocks and the second one would work because of `self.sync_blocks()`.\r\n\r\nWhat `sync_blocks()` does is it waits for all the nodes to be caught up with each other. This ensures the reverse of our problem doesn't happen: a test where all the nodes need to be caught up to continue does not fail intermittently and so with that the second assert is safe. But for the first assert we would basically need the inverse of the functionality, i.e. something that ensures that the nodes are definitely not caught up with each other until we have finished what we want to test.\r\n\r\n",

Do you have any specific use cases in mind? Of course there is no guarantee to stay below the exact number but for `prune=550` this has the potential to double or tripple the number quickly. And the worst case scenario of crashing due to a full disc seems bad enough that it's worth to disable something where it's unclear if there is a use case for it at all (using the RPC in this way).
