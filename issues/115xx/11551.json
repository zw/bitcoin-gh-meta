   "body" : "Fix likely unintentional unsigned integer wrap-around in `GetBlockProofEquivalentTime(...)` when `to.nChainWork <= from.nChainWork`.\r\n\r\n**Description:**\r\n\r\n`int64_t GetBlockProofEquivalentTime(const CBlockIndex& to, const CBlockIndex& from, Ã¢ÂÂ¦)`\r\ncontains the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint sign = 1;\r\nif (to.nChainWork > from.nChainWork) {\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ¦\r\n} else {\r\n    Ã¢ÂÂ¦\r\n    sign = -1;\r\n}\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ¦\r\nreturn sign * r.GetLow64();\r\n```\r\n\r\n`r.GetLow64()` is of type `uint64_t`.\r\n\r\nNote that the types of the two operands in `sign * r.GetLow64()` differ in signedness.\r\n\r\nSince `uint64_t` is wider than `int` the signed operand (`sign`) is converted to the unsigned type.\r\n\r\nIn the case of `sign == -1` (`to.nChainWork <= from.nChainWork`) we wrap around and end up with `18446744073709551615 * r.GetLow64()` (`std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max() * r.GetLow64()`) instead of the intended `-1 * r.GetLow64()`.\r\n\r\nNote however that another conversion takes place when the result is converted into the return type \r\n(`int64_t`), so the resulting value should be the expected one (equivalent to `-1 * r.GetLow64()`).\r\n\r\nIn the case that this behaviour (wrap-around + relying on return type to fix) is intentional a comment should probably be added to indicate so :-)\r\n\r\n`GetBlockProofEquivalentTime(Ã¢ÂÂ¦)` was introduced in f7303f97933be33e34d482cf8348d180c8da2a26. Friendly ping @sipa - intentional or not? :-)\r\n\r\n",
