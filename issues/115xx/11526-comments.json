And if you wanted all the .exe applications (bench_bitcoin, bitcoin-cli, bitcoind, bitcoin-tx, test_bitcoin) you'd still need a separate project. And at a minimum I'd recommend the Qt related source files be excluded as since when the pre-processsing steps (protoc, bincc, moc, uic, lrelease) are invoked it can take a looong time. \r\n\r\nI think the following projects \"could\" be safely consolidated if people thought it was a good idea: \r\n\r\n- libunivalue \r\n- libleveldb \r\n- libbitcoin_zmp\r\n- libbitcoinwallet\r\n- libbitcoin_util\r\n- libbitcoin_server \r\n- libbitcoin_crypto \r\n- libbitcoin_common\r\n- libbitcoin_cli\r\n\r\nMy vote is for a modular approach that mirrors the existing makefiles. Ultimately though I'd be happy with any VS build config in the bitcoin or bitcoin-core repos that empowers us poor MS devs with our emancipated command line skills.\r\n\r\nI will go ahead and remove the .vcxproj.filters files as they are only used to layout the source files in each project and given the concerns about verbosity can safely be omitted.\r\n",
