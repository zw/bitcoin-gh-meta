And if you wanted all the .exe applications (bench_bitcoin, bitcoin-cli, bitcoind, bitcoin-tx, test_bitcoin) you'd still need a separate project. And at a minimum I'd recommend the Qt related source files be excluded as since when the pre-processsing steps (protoc, bincc, moc, uic, lrelease) are invoked it can take a looong time. \r\n\r\nI think the following projects \"could\" be safely consolidated if people thought it was a good idea: \r\n\r\n- libunivalue \r\n- libleveldb \r\n- libbitcoin_zmp\r\n- libbitcoinwallet\r\n- libbitcoin_util\r\n- libbitcoin_server \r\n- libbitcoin_crypto \r\n- libbitcoin_common\r\n- libbitcoin_cli\r\n\r\nMy vote is for a modular approach that mirrors the existing makefiles. Ultimately though I'd be happy with any VS build config in the bitcoin or bitcoin-core repos that empowers us poor MS devs with our emancipated command line skills.\r\n\r\nI will go ahead and remove the .vcxproj.filters files as they are only used to layout the source files in each project and given the concerns about verbosity can safely be omitted.\r\n",

The project files are working for me, but could use a few changes and fixes:\r\n\r\n* I think the project files should be added to main repository, but under a `contrib/build-msvc/` directory instead of the top level `build_msvc/` because they are significant contribution that can save windows developers who want to work with bitcoin a lot of time, headaches, and effort, but are also something we need to be able to easily drop in case they stop being maintained, or become more of a burden to maintain than we are anticipating.\r\n\r\n* I needed to add `..\\..\\src\\secp256k1\\include` to \"additional include directories\" for the `libbitcoin_{common,server,wallet}` projects in order for them to be able to find `secp256k1_recovery.h`, which is part of the vcpkg secp256k1 build tree, but does not seem to get installed. (The only secp file in `C:\\Users\\russ\\src\\vcpkg\\installed\\x64-windows-static\\include` is `secp256k1.h`.) Maybe it would be better to just use the included secp sources instead of relying on the vcpkg package. That's what this PR is already doing for univalue and leveldb.\r\n\r\n* It might make sense to drop the libbitcoin_qt project for now since it doesn't seem to be working yet.\r\n\r\n* The `test_bitcoin` and `bench_bitcoin` projects which rely on generated files aren't currently working for me. Errors look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3>------ Build started: Project: bench_bitcoin, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\r\n3>checkblock.cpp\r\n3>c:\\users\\russ\\src\\bitcoin\\src\\bench\\checkblock.cpp(13): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'bench/data/block413567.raw.h': No such file or directory\r\n3>Done building project \"bench_bitcoin.vcxproj\" -- FAILED.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n3>------ Build started: Project: test_bitcoin, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\r\n3>transaction_tests.cpp\r\n3>c:\\users\\russ\\src\\bitcoin\\src\\test\\transaction_tests.cpp(5): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'data/tx_invalid.json.h': No such file or directory\r\n3>sighash_tests.cpp\r\n3>c:\\users\\russ\\src\\bitcoin\\src\\test\\sighash_tests.cpp(7): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'data/sighash.json.h': No such file or directory\r\n3>script_tests.cpp\r\n3>c:\\users\\russ\\src\\bitcoin\\src\\test\\script_tests.cpp(5): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'data/script_tests.json.h': No such file or directory\r\n3>base58_tests.cpp\r\n3>c:\\users\\russ\\src\\bitcoin\\src\\test\\base58_tests.cpp(7): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'data/base58_encode_decode.json.h': No such file or directory\r\n3>Generating Code...\r\n3>Done building project \"test_bitcoin.vcxproj\" -- FAILED.\r\n========== Build: 2 succeeded, 1 failed, 8 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n* There are tons of compiler warnings, mostly about implicit integer conversions in serialization code which would be nice to fix separately.\r\n\r\n* I suspect maintaining a CMakeLists.txt file (if someone wanted to step up and write one) would probably be easier than maintaining all these xml project defintions. The community edition version of visual studio I downloaded has an option to explicitly open cmake files, so it doesn't seem to be true that using CMake would add an extra step the visual studio build process. I have a lot of experience with CMake on unix, and my overall impression is that while the CMake language, primitives, and workflow are gratuitously weird, they do work really well in practice.",

If necessary they can be moved to wherever the consensus decides.\r\n\r\n- Thanks for the note on the missing secp256k1 headers. That's a problem with the vcpkg I created for it. I've fixed and submitted the [PR](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/pull/2058) to Microsoft.\r\n\r\n- libbitcoin_qt does build but requires the Qt5 dependency set up correctly. The vcpkg Qt5 package currently doesn't support static builds. Like anything with Qt it will take a lot of time and effort to wrangle so in this case, and assuming this PR goes ahead, stage 2 will be to document/package the Qt5 dependency.\r\n\r\n- I'd overlooked the pre-generated files for the test and bench projects. I must have copied them straight across from the mingw build. Will look into those shortly.\r\n\r\n- Maintaining CMake files would be more effort than maintaining the VS files. It would make sense if the CMake config was being used to generate other build configs but this PR is only concerned about VS. A substantial portion of Windows devs don't tend to use the *nix tool chains and aren't familiar with CMake etc. and a straight VS config will make life easier for them.\r\n\r\n",

It would be good if we could drop this requirement back to maybe Win7?",

As far as the target Windows SDK version I believe Visual Studio will revert to its default if what's specified in the project file is not available but I'm not 100% on that. Apart from that it's trivial to retarget to a different Windows SDK, in the Solution Explorer pane right click the Solution->Retarget solution and then select the desired SDK version. That updates the SDK version for all projects and configurations in the solution in a couple of clicks.",
