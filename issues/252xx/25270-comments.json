But I don't think it would be right to say rpcauth is less secure than cookie auth.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage cookies have over RPC passwords is just their convenience. Other than being generated randomly each restart, they don't provide extra security. You could write a script to randomly generate new passwords for grafana each time bitcoin is restarted to get the same effect as using a cookie.\r\n\r\nRPC passwords also have an advantage over cookies because they are hashed. So if an attacker manages to get read access to the bitcoin directory, they can't easily use password hashes to connect to the server, while they could straightforwardly use the cookie file to connect.\r\n\r\nAlso it looks like depending on your setup you may be able control permissions of the cookie file in current versions of bitcoind by running `umask 0027` and passing `-sysperms` argument.",
