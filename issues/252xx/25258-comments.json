Due to recent mempool chop, the chances of requiring a round-trip for slightly-later-but-behaving high bandwidth peer's cb goes way up, and currently cannot be accommodated.\r\n\r\ncouple of questions to think about:\r\n1) should the 2nd download only work for outbound connections? currently there are 3 hb peers possible, and only one outbound is \"protected\". Sybil nodes can take up 2 inbound slots pretty easily. Perhaps if first to announce is outbound, we allow an inbound as second as well?\r\n2) is 10 transaction diff as per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10984 reasonable with today's mempool characteristics?",
