This was only needed when nNow was recorded in seconds, but now that it's milliseconds, it's very unlikely there'll be two nNows that are equal. Also, the -1 was added when it was seconds since 1 was the small subtraction possible. Why, when it changes to milliseconds, was the 1 changed to 1000000? 1 is still the smallest subtraction possible, so surely it should be -1 not -1000000. Or am I misunderstanding the point of the code? @sipa ?",
