I'm not totally sure this doesn't introduce other problems, however -- right now I'm watching a pruning node do an IBD with this patch (with a large `-dbcache`), and I'm observing that the frequent utxo writes (as files get pruned) are very slow, presumably because it's looping through a large utxo cache to find the dirty entries.  So if this doesn't actually help with pruning, then I might need to tighten the scope to only do this for the periodic writes.",

This isn't too surprising if you assume that the purpose of the dbcache is a write buffer for the purpose of eliminating writes on short lived objects (and the additional writes to delete them), rather than a read cache.  Maybe on a slow disk the read cache component is more important, but on SSD it doesn't appear to be.\r\n\r\nIf benchmarks support doing this, I'm all for it!  but it sounds to me like they might not.\r\n\r\nLong term what I'd like to see is keeping a linked list of writes,  and after letting the cache fill a day or a weeks worth of activity (interesting open question: what is the amount of write suppression as a function of the buffer horizon?), start writing out (and erasing) the surviving oldest block worth of activity after each connected block... this way we're always writing rather than blocking on writes in big bursts.\r\n\r\nBy writing in block-ordered order (or something close to it) we would get the ability to continually advance the synced-to point.   (I also assumed that we'd change to some kind of open hash table for the random lookups--to reduce the pointer chasing, have a collision resolution which will overwrite non-dirty entries whenever its convenient, and write flushing simply make entries non-dirty rather than erasing them). \r\n\r\nOr, at least, this was the kind of thing I had in mind when suggesting non-atomic-flushing. But all that stuff is a big project. :(    I suspect the periodic flushes are by far the biggest source of blockacceptance/gbt latency though,  so it's one which would almost certainly have a big payoff.",

At any rate this approach seems like it's not worth pursuing, so I'll close.",
