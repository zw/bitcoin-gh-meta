   "body" : "Using the `travis_wait` command in conjunction with `set -o errexit` causes problems. The `travis_wait` command will correctly log the command's output if successful, but if the command fails the process exits before the `travis_wait` command can dump the logs. This will hide important debugging information like error messages and stack traces. We ran into this in #15196 and it was very hard to debug because output was being suppressed.\r\n\r\n`travis_wait` was being used because the `contrib/verify-commits/verify-commits.py` script can sometimes run for a long time without producing any output. If a script runs for 10 minutes without logging anything, the CI run times out. The `travis_wait` command will extend this timeout by logging a message for you, while sending stderr and stdout to a file.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `travis_wait` command from our CI system and adds additional logging to the `verify-commits.py` script so it doesn't make Travis timeout.
