I thought at first that maybe we'd want `filterInventoryKnown` to be as correct as possible even in the `fBlocksOnly` case, since we might still relay transactions to that peer (eg if we have a whitelisted peer and `-whitelistrelay` is on), but given that it's a protocol violation this seems like a silly thing to worry about.\r\n\r\nI was thinking we could probably use a p2p regression test that exercises `filterInventoryKnown`, as I don't believe any of our tests would fail if it were broken?  \r\n\r\nI'll plan to update this PR at some point with a test and the change for the `fBlocksOnly` case.",
