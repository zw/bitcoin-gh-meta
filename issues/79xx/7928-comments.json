If your clock is wrong Bitcoin will not work properly.\"` means you probably run with a incorrect system clock. You should fix that.\r\n\r\n2) You can change the maximum allowed time adjustment by setting `maxtimeadjustment=<value>`.\r\n\r\n3)\r\n> `bitcoin-qt.exe\" -alert -reindex -disablewallet`\r\n\r\nWhat is the `-alert` arg for? IIRC that is not supported by Bitcoin-Core.\r\nI don't think `-disablewallet` will have a significant impact on the maxtimeadjustment behavior.\r\n\r\nThe `AddTimeData()` is related to `version` messages. Maybe in your seconds `-disablewallet` tests you did connect to more nodes and got more samples?\r\n\r\nIs this always reproducible? ",

      "body" : "1) The first thing I did was synchronize my clock while attempting to diagnose the issue, but it did not appear to stopping the messages appearing - nor was the time noticeably \"off\" to start with. I had also never seen this prior to attempting to reindex. Unfortunately I did not think to keep the debug log from those runs, as I was more keen in figuring out if I could get it to start reindexing at all.\r\n\r\n2) I'll see whether that changes anything if there is a recurrence.\r\n\r\n3) You're right, [it should be -alerts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin#Command-line_arguments), thanks! I added it on seeing they had been disabled by default in the release notes, because I am keen to hear whatever the Japanese government has to say to users.\r\n\r\n4) The issue was 100% reproducible the four or five times I did it, until I added the -disablewallet parameter. Upon doing so, *the time warning still popped up* - the difference was that now when I clicked OK to dismiss it, the UI did not lock up and CPU and disk activity proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe popup always occurred within a few seconds, though the \"time behind\" at the point of the popup varied slightly - possibly related to how many initial blocks were already in disk cache as it processed them, or how long it took to establish connections.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one way to reproduce the UI freeze would be to force that dialog to always pop up, although it might not be that simple if it had to process some transactions first. I'm nine hours into reindexing my node and it's only 1/3 through, so I must admit I'm not super-keen to try it again unless it falls over. :-)\r\n\r\nIn case it matters, I do have some bitcoin in my wallet; the transactions for it would not be visible since I had dumped the index.",
