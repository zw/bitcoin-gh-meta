I do understand how this could be a challenge for the team, and I certainly am not trying to create work.  Unfortunately, at this time, I am pretty locked into Snow Leopard.  I hope to be able to move forward (perhaps through the use of virtual machines?) at some point during the next 12 months, but I would need a working installation of Bitcoin Core long before then.  For me, it isn't a matter of just dragging my feet or not wanting to upgrade, I'd prefer to be on El Cap, if for no other reason than security patches.  I just have to be patient for the time being.\r\n     You asked if I can \"compile other c/c++ code?\", to which I say, \"I'm not sure\".  I haven't had need to do so recently.  Does anyone have a recommendation as to a simple build I could try to test this?  My only requirements are...\r\n\r\n1. Needs to be a trusted code base -- I can not afford to add any security vulnerabilities, and\r\n2. Needs to be easy to build...  I'm not afraid of the CLI, but I don't live there.  I can follow a well written \"how to\" but following instructions and understanding what one is doing are two completely different things.\r\n\r\nThank you, Mr. van der Laan\r\n\r\n-----\r\npaveljanik,\r\n\r\nHopefully the below file is what you are looking for...\r\n\r\n[config.log.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/224390/config.log.txt)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI appreciate the work that you all do for the community.  As before, please let me know if there is more that I can do to help...\r\nRegards",

      "body" : "> If I run an older version (say 0.11.2) of Bitcoin Core, are there security risks?\r\n\r\nProbably not, but you should check the release notes of releases since that one to see if any critical vulnerabilities have been patched. Sometimes security vulnerabilities are found and are fixed in later versions\r\n\r\n> Are there trustworthy BTC apps for the iOS platform?\r\n\r\nYes, but Bitcoin Core does not run on iOS.\r\n\r\n> If I run one on iOS will it consume gigabytes of storage in order to maintain a copy of the blockchain?\r\n\r\nIt depends on the software. Most mobile software will be either an SPV wallet or web wallet so it won't download the entire blockchain.\r\n\r\n> Does Apple accept BTC for me to buy a \"new\" system which will run current software? =-$\r\n\r\nNo. Apple does not accept Bitcoin",
