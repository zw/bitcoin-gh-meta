As x86 char is signed the sorting for the block index database was messed up, resulting in a segfault due to missing records. This should be caught by the tests.\r\n\r\nAdd a test to catch:\r\n- Wrong sorting\r\n- Seeking errors\r\n- Iteration result not complete\r\n- Wrong keys/values from iterator\r\n\r\nAlso add an assertion to CBlockIndex::GetAncestor, as this it the place it will segfault when block index records are missing. An assertion error is easier to diagnose than a pointer crash (although what we really need is a start-up check whether the database is complete otherwise suggest a reindex).\r\n",
