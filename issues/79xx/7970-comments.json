I think it should be `-I/h/vm/db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/include/` (append the **`include/`**).\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe you manage it to install a newer version over a mingw package manager (mingw-get or something), though I'm not familiar with mingw package managers.\r\nYou can always pass `--with-incompatible-bdb` in `./configure` to allow compilation against newer versions of berkley db (which results in wallet files that are incompatible with bitcoin version compiled with bdb 4.8).\r\n\r\n",
