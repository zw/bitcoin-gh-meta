Anyway, if you are trying to empty a wallet, you should use `sendall`.\r\n\r\nIn all other cases where your wallet has a balance that exceeds what you are trying to send at least by a bit,  `SelectCoinsSRD(â¦)` will always find a solution as it will continue selecting inputs until it exceeds `target_value+CHANGE_LOWER`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the Issue Tracker is the best place to ask questions about the Bitcoin Core codebase. It might be better to ask in the [#bitcoin-core-pr-reviews](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat?channel=#bitcoin-core-pr-reviews) channel on Libera Chat (IRC), or on Bitcoin Stack Exchange with the [tag [bitcoin-core-development]](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bitcoin-core-development).",

I also couldn't find any accompanying tests for this which would also be helpful.\r\n\r\nAs for your comment, I wasn't sure if this was a potential issue or not so I started here.  The `#bitcoin-core-pr-reviews` seems more geared toward reviewing active or recent PR's, right?  Wouldn't `#bitcoin-core-dev` be more appropriate?  I didn't want to be intrusive so I'll also consider Bitcoin Stack Exchange in the future.",
