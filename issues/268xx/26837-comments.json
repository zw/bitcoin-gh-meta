The key is you've gone from 290 tunnels at startup down to 22, which is a massive massive improvement.\r\n\r\nA couple notes:\r\n\r\n- You should monitor/test the reliability of connections over transient tunnels with *.quantity=1. If it doesn't meet your requirements, retest with *.quantity=2 to see if that improves things enough to be worth the additional resource usage.\r\n- You should monitor/test the performance of non-transient tunnels with *.quantity=3. If it doesn't meet your requirements, try 4 or 5 to see if that improves things enough to be worth the additional resource usage.\r\n- Agreed you want to avoid a pool with lots of unused sessions for a long time, either by design or some check. Also maybe close all idle sessions once you get to 10 good ones? Up to you, you're on the right track here.\r\n- Try to get an ack from i2pd's @orignal",

I2P Destinations are designed to be long-lived, it's not like in Tor where you can create tons of circuits. Waiting for tunnels to be built for each connection also adds a huge amount of delay to connection setup time.  A high number of addresses will also result in excessive CPU and bandwidth usage by your router to build the tunnels for each. Additionally, other routers will reject your excessive tunnel building, which will increase your resource usage even more as your router retries. And, of course, the overhead applies to every connection attempt, not just every successful connection.*\r\n\r\nLocally, I'm seeing between 45-100 seconds for a successful transient I2P connection to be established, based on the \"Creating transient SAM session xyz\" and \"Transient SAM session xyz created\" logging in `src/i2p.cpp`.\r\n",
