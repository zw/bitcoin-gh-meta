However this is not useful as if `rpcbind` is actually activated, the bound IP addresses will be written to the log anyways. The test `feature_config_args.py` did not catch this contradiction as the test node was not started with `rpcallowip` and so `rpcbind` was not acted upon.\r\n\r\nThis also brings `rpcbind` inline with `bind` as that is not flagged as sensitive either.",
