      "body" : "If not all of our pending outgoing messages can fit in the socket's transmit buffer, then we *want* all of our calls to `send` to specify `MSG_MORE`. The kernel will immediately (without delay) transmit as many full segments as it can assemble and that will fit in the congestion window. It will not immediately transmit a partial segment but instead will call back to us (via returning a writable status from `select`, `poll`, `epoll`, etc.) to fetch more data to transmit. If we have no more data to transmit, then yes, calling `send` with a zero length and without `MSG_MORE` will tell the kernel that we have nothing left to send, and it will transmit a partial segment as soon as such segment will fit in the congestion window.\r\n\r\nIn your example, if the second of the three 10-byte messages can only partially be copied to the socket transmit buffer, then it must be the case that the transmit buffer is now full. The transmit buffer is always larger than MSS, the maximum segment size, meaning the kernel can now assemble a full segment, which it will transmit as soon as the window allows. It will then indicate the socket is writable again, and we will be called again to write more of the second message.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, your concern that we will unnecessarily delay transmitting data is unwarranted. The kernel never delays transmitting a full segment if it fits in the congestion window. The kernel does delay transmitting a partial segment that fits in the congestion window if the last call to `send` on that socket specified `MSG_MORE`, but that's exactly what we want, as we want the opportunity to write more data into the transmit buffer so the kernel will potentially transmit fewer and larger segments.",

Vasil's concern is the case where we try to send a non-final message, run out of space in the kernel's transmit buffer (so only some of the message was copied in), then go off and do other things for a virtual eternity. If we haven't called `send` without `MSG_MORE`, then it is *possible* that there is a complete message sitting in the kernel's transmit buffer (ahead of the incomplete message that we failed to fully write) that will be delayed. That's true, but I'd say that's by design. If it's really taking us longer than 200 ms for the network I/O loop to make a full pass, we have much bigger problems!",

In that case, there will be no artificial delay introduced to any message we've written to the socket.\r\n\r\nSo, basically, we want the network I/O loop to come back around to service our socket again in less time than the kernel's transmit buffer takes to drain.",
