Your listing of the features makes sense, and I currently don't think a more optimal way to achieve them.\r\n\r\nBy no means blockers, but rather some thoughts I wanted to share on the design:\r\n1. I'm personally not sure batching withdrawals is that compelling... It's a nice-to-have, but I'd think about the benefits dropping this feature would provide.\r\n2. Or, from a different angle, the issue of malicious de-batching should not stop this idea from moving forward, as I'm not convinced this use case would be that widespread. I want to think more about use cases (solo user cold wallet, exchange cold wallet, fund cold wallet) and what their setups would look like.",

The impossibility to batch Unvaults in Revault is a major drawback: it significantly increases the cost of any realistic operation (you need one whole additional transaction per input, and each have likely more than one output). It also potentially increases the cost on the network (you'd likely want some sort of anchor output on each Unvault tx, that you might not spend, so that's `2*n` outputs created with `n` the number of coins spent): we definitely don't want to prevent batching. The ability to batch the recovery transactions (what we called Emergency tx in Revault) is also very compelling but i think your comment was only about batched withdrawals.",

My apologies if these are premature!\r\n\r\nI believe the recursion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f8d55bb32c267f2f02e67ad1dec1af65c6f16881/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1334) ought to be explicitly limited. As it stands, an attacker could crash a node by crafting a transaction spending from a vault that has, as its `recov_spk_script`, a P2WSH scriptPubkey with a `witnessScript` of:\r\n\r\n`OP_3 OP_PICK OP_3 OP_PICK OP_3 OP_PICK OP_3 OP_PICK OP_VAULT`\r\n\r\nIf you supply `witnessScript, recovery_params, delay, 0x00*32, witnessScript` to the witness stack (in addition to the initial witness stack [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f8d55bb32c267f2f02e67ad1dec1af65c6f16881/test/functional/feature_vaults.py#L671-L676)), it'll recurse infinitely and crash. (See diff at the end of this comment for my addition to the test code.)\r\n\r\nA potential attacker could also perform almost any arbitrary computation using a similar method.\r\n\r\nThe recursion also doesn't count any potential additional signature operations toward the `sigOps` limits from what I can tell. (Maybe this is by design, though?)\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't think implementing these opcodes as `OP_NOPs` is workable as a soft fork. The current implementation is actually (I think) a hard fork, given that the stack will not be clean for old nodes and they'll reject most transactions using these opcodes. Even absent the cleanstack rule for witness scripts, the top element could be `false` in this case for old nodes yet the script would succeed in this PR, since it [pushes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f8d55bb32c267f2f02e67ad1dec1af65c6f16881/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1341) a `true`.\r\n\r\nI think it's generally unsafe for a reimplemented `NOP` to push to or pop the stack. My suggestion would be restricting `OP_VAULT` / `OP_UNVAULT` to be Tapscript only and using `OP_SUCCESSx` codes.  \r\n\r\nDiff for `feature_vaults.py`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n\r\n@@ -21,0 +22 @@ from test_framework.util import assert_equal, assert_raises_rpc_error\r\n+from test_framework.script_util import script_to_p2wsh_script\r\n@@ -64,0 +66,3 @@ class VaultsTest(BitcoinTestFramework):\r\n+            title(\"testing recursive attack sweep\")\r\n+            self.single_vault_test(node, wallet, sweep_from_vault=True)\r\n+\r\n@@ -447 +451,3 @@ DEFAULT_UNVAULT_SECRET = 3\r\n-\r\n+def get_recursive_witness_script() -> CScript:\r\n+    return CScript([script.OP_3, script.OP_PICK, script.OP_3, script.OP_PICK, script.OP_3,\r\n+                    script.OP_PICK, script.OP_3, script.OP_PICK, script.OP_VAULT])\r\n@@ -465 +471,3 @@ class VaultSpec:\r\n-        self.recovery_spk = CScript([script.OP_TRUE])\r\n+        recursive_script = get_recursive_witness_script()\r\n+        recursive_program = script_to_p2wsh_script(recursive_script)\r\n+        self.recovery_spk = recursive_program\r\n@@ -672,0 +681,5 @@ def get_sweep_to_recovery_tx(\r\n+                get_recursive_witness_script(),\r\n+                vault.recovery_params,\r\n+                CScript([vault.spend_delay]),\r\n+                CScript(b'\\x00' * 32),\r\n+                get_recursive_witness_script(),\r\n\r\n\r\n```",

I'd planned to move OP_VAULT/OP_UNVAULT to OP_SUCCESSx as of late last week, and was vaguely aware that the recursion probably facilitates Bad Things, but your detailed explanations and test cases (!) are very valuable. Never too early to point out a crash bug! Thank you for your help.\r\n\r\nI'll remedy these things in the coming days.",
