      "body" : "It looks like the block header variables are:\r\n\r\n`Version + hashPrevBlock + hashMerkleRoot + Time + Bits + Nonce`\r\n\r\nSo, there are six total variables that need to be submitted. `Bits` is the `target` in compact form, which is apparently different from the `hashPrevBlock`, which is curious because my impression was the hash of the previous block is the target. Moreover, this six variable header leaves out `workid` and `coinbasevalue`, so it could be possible these variables are just noise. This may be unlikely though given [BIP0022](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0022), which is relatively silent on the core issue of submission.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the [bitcoin.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoin-cli.cpp) file in Bitcoin Core does not include a reference to `submitblock`. Still there must be a mechanism for differentiating between.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> hexlify(hash).decode(\"utf-8\")\r\n'1dbd981fe6985776b644b173a4d0385ddc1aa2a829688d1e0000000000000000'\r\n>>> hexlify(hash[::-1]).decode(\"utf-8\")\r\n'00000000000000001e8d6829a8a21adc5d38d0a473b144b6765798e61f98bd1d'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere must also be a way to determine file format, whether bytecode or JSON.\r\n",
