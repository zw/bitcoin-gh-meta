This has the (incredibly) nice property of not re-deserializing the same block over and over again in SendMessages when we go to announce the block.\r\n\r\nFinally caches the block which was just announced to respond to getblocktxn requests without a similar deserialize (this could probably be extended to be used by other requests as well, but other requests are still going to want to lock cs_main and check that the block didn't get rejected as invalid first).",
