   "body" : "The current version is lifted directly from [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/), i.e.\r\n\r\n    Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; \r\n    managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the \r\n    network.\r\n\r\nSo as an improvement to readability I propose to change the present perfect progressive such as `managing` and `issuing` to declarative sentences for the form `management` & `issuance`. \r\n\r\nAlso I chopped up the last sentence which was kind of long, into two shorter ones with the links.
