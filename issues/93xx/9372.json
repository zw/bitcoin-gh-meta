   "body" : "[This is an alternative approach to #9366]\r\n\r\nThe `bswap_XX` functions are sometimes provided by external libraries (protobuf) and sometimes not. To avoid inconsistency and relying on include order, the idea is to move these into a dedicated namespace (`Bitcoin`). Since they are declared as macros by e.g. protobuf, they are `#undef`d as well.\r\n\r\nThe one caveat with this approach is when someone would include `compat/byteswap.h`, and then include protobuf's `port.h` (in that order). In this case, the macro would be redefined and `Bitcoin::bswap_XX` would result in a compilation error.\r\n",
