What's puzzling is it works with Michagogo's guide but doesn't work with the github guide.  Today I looked at it and thought hm maybe there's something wrong with that directory.  So I typed \"cd\" and it went to this directory:  \r\n\r\n```molxyz@LAPTOP-O22LRA5I:~$```\r\n\r\nFrom then on everything works!  I tested and got master, 0.13.0, and 0.13.1 versions built with no problem.  Could not get v0.12.0 and v0.12.1 built though, but I will tinker on that later.  \r\nI'm new to linux and this sub system, I thought  `molxyz@LAPTOP-O22LRA5I:/mnt/c/Users/moli$`  and  `molxyz@LAPTOP-O22LRA5I:~$` should be the same directory but I guess not? \r\n \r\n@achow101 and @laanwj , thank you for your help and fast replies.

They are separate directories on different file systems. Your windows drive is mounted under `/mnt/c` in the Linux root. The Linux root is not directly accessible from windows (this is why there is an install step to install the executables to the windows drive).\r\n\r\nI don't understand why it matters for the build instructions, where you put the files, though.
