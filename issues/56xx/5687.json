It's stuck on block 339768, hash 0000000000000000160483c084b185b87e974467e0f684a1b26cc555174b59c7, currently about 7 hours old. I have 34 peer connections and ~33k transactions in my mempool. In debug.log I'm seeing a lot of AcceptToMemoryPool errors; not sure what else to look for.\r\n\r\nThis is on Linux x86_64, using the binary downloaded from bitcoin.org. I've confirmed I'm not out of disk space.\r\n\r\nI notice there's an rc3 up now, but I'll hold off on restarting or upgrading in case there's anything you want me to try first.",
