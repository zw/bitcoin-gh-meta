Age counted down from 5 to 3 days.  At this point, age ceased to count down on the main window and the processed block number on the main window and the Help Information window was unchanging. Looking at the Help Network Traffic window it looked like the network IO had been completed.  Windows task manager showed that all processor cores were busy servicing Bitcoin Core.  The program appeared to be hung, except that the two windows responded to mouse actions.  Checking the Debug Log it appeared that blocks were being processed and logged normally at the usual high speed. The problem appeared to be a lagging user interface display, not an actual lag in processing.\r\n\r\nWhen catchup happened, the progress display still showed 3 days of blocks to catch up just before it disappeared and the green check mark appeared.",
