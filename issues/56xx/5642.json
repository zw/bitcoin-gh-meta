   "body" : "The intention of this pull is to be able to extend the existing unit-tests for payment requests. This is achieved by adding a second ``PaymentRequest Test CA`` (serial number f0:da:97:e4:38:d7:64:16) into paymentrequestdata.h. The CA was generated by my using \"ca_in_a_box\" (by @gavinandresen), which I've partly re-worked to natively run on Windows. Also the code in paymentservertests was reworked to be able to directly load payment request raw data from paymentrequestdata.h into an usable ``PaymentRequestPlus`` object. This is used to skip normal client code flow, to be able to explicitly test and verify payment request validity.\r\n \r\nAs a first step I integrated a new unit test, which is able to verify that the \"client network matches the payment request network\" rule is working as intended.",
