   "body" : "It turns out that some miners have been staying with old versions of\n Bitcoin Core because their software  behaves poorly with persistent\n connections and the Bitcoin Core thread and connection limits.\n\nWhat happens is that underlying  HTTP libraries leave connections open\n invisibly to their users and then the user runs into the default four\n thread limit.  This looks like Bitcoin Core is unresponsive to RPC.\n\nThere are many things that should be improved in Bitcoin Core's behavior\n here, e.g. supporting more concurrent connections, not tying up threads\n for idle connections, disconnecting kept-alive  connections when limits\n are reached, etc. All are fairly big, risky changes.\n\nDisabling keep-alive is a simple workaround. It's often not easy to turn\n off the keep-alive support in the client where it may be buried in some\n platform library.\n\nIf you are one of the few who really needs persistent connections you\n probably know that you want them and can find a switch; while if you\n don't and the misbehavior is hitting you it is hard to discover the\n source of your problems is keepalive related.  Given that it is best\n to default to off until they're handled better.\n",
