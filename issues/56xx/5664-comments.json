Also, at least on my system it is repeatable.\r\n\r\nThere may be a related problem during block acquisition whereby all network activity ceases for several minutes while downloading but all the blocks haven't yet been downloaded.  In this case, the difference would be that the system would be quiescent with no processor, disk or network activity but unfetched blocks available on peers or fetched but not being processed by the CPU.  At the time I suspected this was happening it was not repeatable, which is why I didn't report it.  If this actually happened then it would be a performance bug and would affect timing of initial bock acquisition.  Probably not a low priority cosmetic bug (unless it was rare and unique to my system) but definitely not a high priority bug either.\r\n",
