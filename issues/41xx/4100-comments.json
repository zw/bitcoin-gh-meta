It doesn't scale to modern mining hardware, that alone is reason enough to get rid of it (we will have to adopt the `contrib/pyminer` to use `getblocktemplate`). I'm not convinced it should happen in this pull, though. Removing midstate seems like a fine intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nNit: we're ending up with a lot of hash-related implementation and header files. Maybe move them to a directory `src/hash`?",

Every modern CPU has a byte-swap instruction.  Any networked LE or BE platform is constantly byte-swapping.\r\n\r\nThe general principle, therefore, is to include your platform's favorite endian.h, and use the macros therein.  It should degenerate into a compiler intrinsic for us.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this becomes painful as BSD and Linux diverge on the opinion of endian macro naming and header location.\r\n",
