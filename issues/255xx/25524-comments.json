      "body" : "NACK \r\n\r\nI had no strong opinion until yesterday and still think she is a good coder and reviewer. However, this pull request gives commit access which I am not sure about:\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n\r\n1. If this pull request is merged, there will be 7 maintainers and 3 funded by Brink. This was even mentioned by @0xB10C as nit in [meeting](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-06-30#827758;). Bitcoin has only 1 implementation used by majority of nodes. It would be better if maintainers were from different parts of world and funded by different organizations. Being anon could also be helpful. \r\n\r\n2. Process of adding another maintainer could be improved. One of the suggestion from @ariard was to know if we have other candidates interested for being a maintainer. Others were mainly about scope of a maintainer.\r\n\r\n3. Self merging mempool related pull requests would be different from build, wallet etc. and if this role is just about running a script then it could be done by any of the present maintainers when there are enough ACKs and no technical NACK. There are a [few other contributors](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-07-01#828347;) that are not sure about self merge.\r\n\r\n4. Speculations about full-rbf being default in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353 by PR author did not look like the right approach. Lot of important pull requests are open that could affect security of different bitcoin projects (positively or negatively) related to mempool. I would prefer status-quo with more reviewers or developers with more experience in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n5. I do not understand why @theuni  was trying to stop some people from sharing their thoughts in meeting.\r\n\r\n6. @laanwj also found questions, suggestions etc. from Jeremy Rubin annoying and mentioned that an opinion about PR author being maintainer was [changed](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-06-30#828026;) recently.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI know this NACK would not be considered being a new contributor and this [comment](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/99674/how-do-devs-decide-who-should-have-commit-access-what-is-the-process/99676#comment112930_99676) by @achow101 however still want to document my thoughts as review for this PR. Also if governments/banks/3 letter agencies would ever try this, I am sure they won't use new contributors or random accounts based on my experience.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "@1440000bytes full time developers are more likely to get to a skill level where they can be a maintainer. Sponsored developers are more likely able to work full time. Conversely, maintainers are more likely to get sponsorship due to their reputation. Combine that with Pareto's law, and you're just going to have a situation where one organisation sponsors a relatively large chunk of maintainers. This happened with Blockstream, then with Chaincode, now with Brink.\r\n\r\nIf we had a huge surplus of candidate maintainers, then perhaps this sort of stuff could factored in. But we nearly ran out. The maintainers that have been around the longest have all been subjected to legal attacks, which could have forced them to become salary slaves at Google to pay off infinite bills. The lead maintainer has said multiple times he [doesn't want to do this forever](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html).\r\n\r\nI'm very happy to see several fresh maintainers step up to this task. It mainly involves ungrateful boring work and personal risk.\r\n\r\nIf you're worried about a pattern of malicious merges by maintainers, then rather than blocking new maintainers, a more productive course of action might be to keep a very close eye on what gets merged. It all happens in the open. There's a signed public record.",

      "body" : "-0, which defaults to NACK from me\r\n\r\n@glozow is an excellent coder and thinker, and I am hugely supportive of her work, but a few things make me hesitate here. My main concern is that @glozow is a not-impartial participant in the development of mempool design, and she has a number of outstanding proposals and PRs in that area. Presumably she will continue to put forward proposed designs that need to be evaluated by others. I think her role as a maintainer might muddy the waters, and cause others to be more likely to defer to her proposals on the basis of perceived hierarchy.\r\n\r\nYou can make the argument that other maintainers were in a similar position when inbound, e.g. @achow101 and @hebasto, but things like wallet and GUI and relatively localized to Core, don't have as wide a design space as mempool, and do not crosscut through the ecosystem in the same way that mempool does. Having a maintainer of the leading implementation who is both maintaining and proposing designs seems like a possible conflict.\r\n\r\nI think an ideal maintainer is someone who is well-grounded enough to have good familiarity with the domain, but who has enough distance to be able to impartially adjudicate the suitability and technical appetite for a PR's merge.\r\n\r\nThere are also specific instances that make me uncertain, albeit to a minor degree, about her judgement as a maintainer. The recent exchange in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25461 does not inspire confidence from my end. Many of Gloria's mempool proposals I heartily support (conceptually at the very least - I'm behind on my review) but proposals that e.g. involve doing replacement policy on the basis of caching block templates (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-March/020124.html) strike me as fairly opinionated and controversial. Of course I don't begrudge people suggesting things that are speculative - it's just tough to dissociate that activity from a place in the (soft) power structure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd then there are ancillary concerns that are a little harder to articulate:\r\n- If maintainership is really just \"janitorial,\" as the refrain commonly goes, and progress in this repo is bottlenecked by review, why do we need more maintainers? Why not just more \"ready for merge?\" pings?\r\n- This is hard to express without coming off as impolite or ad hominem, but we have a pretty large plurality of young maintainers who don't really have a lot of experience in other projects. Furthermore, this plurality seems pretty tightly linked in terms of funding, personal life, etc. to the point where I've heard concern expressed from other contributors that there may be a \"virtuous circle\" of mutual ACKs among maintainers. I'm not trying to criticize or alienate, but I think the potential for weirdness is growing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, all this to say that I'm a huge fan of Gloria's work and I really hope it continues. A lot of Bitcoin's future is contingent on fixing the mempool, and she's been a big part of that over the last two years. I just have various reservations that amount to a -0, which - when considering something like maintainership - defaults to a NACK. \r\n\r\nIf we're going to have another maintainer, I'd like to see someone who is a little further removed, more experienced in the repo, and somewhat more disjoint from the funding/social graph.\r\n\r\nBut I also think we need to back up a little and answer: if maintainers really are just \"janitors,\" why do we need another maintainer? Do we need to revisit the role of maintainers? Should they be expected to take a more active role in setting goals for regions of the system - if so, that's okay (and I think might even solve some problems!) but we should make that explicit instead of just repeating this maintainers-are-just-janitors line while kind of implicitly expecting something else.",

Self merging mempool related pull requests would be different from build, wallet etc. and if this role is just about running a script then it could be done by any of the present maintainers when there are enough ACKs and no technical NACK. There are a [few other contributors](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-07-01#828347;) that are not sure about self merge.\r\n\r\nI think concerns about self merging are overblown. Self merges are not that common, and I think it is widely understood that self merges are not a good look. Just because someone is a maintainer does not mean that the code they write is going to automatically be merged, particularly by themselves.\r\n\r\n> I think an ideal maintainer is someone who is well-grounded enough to have good familiarity with the domain, but who has enough distance to be able to impartially adjudicate the suitability and technical appetite for a PR's merge.\r\n\r\nI don't see how that would be possible if that person were not directly implementing code in those areas prior to maintainership. To build up the expertise required to have the familiarity with the domain would require working on it directly, and so inherently run into your issue of conflict of interest.\r\n\r\n> * If maintainership is really just \"janitorial,\" as the refrain commonly goes, and progress in this repo is bottlenecked by review, why do we need more maintainers? Why not just more \"ready for merge?\" pings?\r\n\r\nObviously part of a maintainer's job is to evalulate whether a PR is ready for merging. Having subject matter expertise makes it easier to make that judgement call. If maintainers are blindly trusting the \"ready for merge\" calls of particular individuals because they are considered experts, then those people are pseudo-maintainers and should be given merge rights to reduce friction. Otherwise \"ready for merge\" pings still require assessing whether a PR is ready for merging.\r\n\r\nAs assessing whether a PR is ready for merge involves both looking at the code and readying through review comments and (N)ACKs, a subject matter expert is far better equipped to make that judgement call with confidence. They will be more familiar with the code itself and could leave a review. They will be more familiar with those who are working in those areas and be able to know how much to weight those people's reviews. This changes what is looked for when assessing whether a PR is ready to be merged.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if I were to look at an area of code that I am not familiar with, I may not be able to leave my own ACK on it because I am not confident in my own review. I may wait for several more ACKs than would otherwise be necessary for the PR to be merged, e.g. waiting for 5 people to ACK rather than 3. This ends up extending the amount of time a \"ready for merge\" PR sits unmerged, and of course brings us back around to the problem of not having enough reviewers. If there were a maintainer who was an expert in that area of code, then they may be able to supply their own review. They may be able to determine that the PR is ready to be merged at 3 ACKs and so merge the PR at that point instead of waiting for additional review. In this way, maintainers who are experts in certain areas allow us to get things merged faster.",

That was uncool and disrespectful.\r\n>\r\n> Again, I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n@theuni: I was rather perplexed why you were apologizing so I reread the conversation log of the meeting and there is absolutely nothing to apologize for. There is a weekly hour long Core dev meeting so when someone (in this case a maintainer) brings a topic (glozow for rbf / mempool / validation maintainer) people shouldn't have to be asked multiple times to stick to the topic (as you were forced to and as the host of the meeting was forced to multiple times). There have been a number of months since the last maintainer was added (achow101) and plenty of opportunity to discuss changing the process for adding maintainers (whether they should have to commit to one-to-one meetings with certain contributors or not etc). All the maintainers are ACKing this and effectively saying they would like another maintainer added to cover mempool/policy. \r\n\r\nIf there are particular concerns with glozow taking on this role (@jamesob raises a couple in his [post](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1172570635) in a thoughtful way which is absolutely fine, this criticism isn't directed towards him) or individual(s) think there is a better candidate than glozow for this role then that is on topic and should be discussed. But discussing who should be the next maintainer(s) after glozow or throwing half baked suggestions around about what glozow should have to do and how far she should have to jump before she becomes a maintainer is totally inappropriate.",

      "body" : "Concept ACK.\r\n\r\nSome replies:\r\n\r\n> I think concerns about self merging are overblown. Self merges are not that common, and I think it is widely understood that self merges are not a good look. Just because someone is a maintainer does not mean that the code they write is going to automatically be merged, particularly by themselves.\r\n> (From https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1172838909 , and a few comments on IRC)\r\n\r\nI agree with your other points in your comment, but I disagree about self merges. First, I think that self merges *are* common. I estimate that about half of my changes are merged by myself, the same estimate should hold for fanquake and you. (I used `git log --merges --since=$date --author=\"$name1\" --grep=\"$name2\"  --oneline | wc -l` to estimate very roughly). In fact, in the absence of several active maintainers per file/module, I fail to see how self merges could be rare.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think self merges are not a good look, simply because they are self merges. Before a change is merged, it should be reviewed. If a change is merged without sufficient review or with outstanding concerns, it should be proposed for a revert (regardless of whether it was a self merge or not). I fail to see how a process that discourages (or even forbids) self-merges is helpful in any way. If anything, it would increase the distraction and burden on other maintainers to keep their constant attention on modules they may not primarily be interested in. (Hypothetically, taking this to the extreme, a requirement for maintainers to perform a dance for each other to avoid a self merge could create a \"virtuous circle\", which was actually used as rationale for a NACK above.)\r\n\r\n> \"funding\" (From various comments)\r\n\r\nSurely funding open source software development is in an early stage and there are many ways it could be improved. However, I'd be concerned if the constantly changing funding landscape was used as a criteria to evaluate the technical proficiency of contributors in the scope of this project. Needless to say that the same goes for the country of residence (or anything not related to this software project) of contributors. If this was used as a criteria, are we going to remove maintainers/contributors as soon as their source of funding changes to a source that already funds a maintainer/contributor?\r\n\r\n> \"questions about the role of maintainers\" (From various comments)\r\n\r\nGenerally, I find it questionable that potentially unclear documentation about the role of maintainers are used as a reason to NACK this proposal. The role of maintainers is explained in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md . I see that the explanation could be updated, based on the discussions on IRC and GitHub. However, it seems absurd to reject a perfectly capable and motivated maintainer candidate based on this.\r\n\r\nMaintainers (just like every other contributor) of this project are evaluated based on the quality of their technical contributions. Suggestions to extend evaluation criteria to also cover unrelated topics (such as funding, country of residence, age, personal life, as well as experience in other projects or work-related settings), seems not only a process burden, but would likely backfire and achieve the opposite of what the stated goal was. Surely there are imperfections (of process documentation and otherwise), but I highly doubt that refusing glozow as a maintainer is going to fix them.",
