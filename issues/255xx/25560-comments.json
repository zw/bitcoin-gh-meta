However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected",

The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion.

However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work.

For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted.

Similarly, other maintainer merging the pull request would take the responsibility to make changes, will be less biased and go through everything before merging.\r\n\r\n- If other maintainer who merges code did not already review the pull request, it will be helpful in getting another review and find new issues, bugs etc. that may go unnoticed. \r\n\r\nExample: If laanwj decides to merge https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24362 instead of achow101 there will be another review, no bias and maybe new issues, bugs etc.\r\n\r\nOnly positive of allowing self merges is merge/week or merge/month is not affected even if less active maintainers.

Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1.

For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer.

Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion.

The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release",

C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer.

Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion.

However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release\n+\n+Maintainers are generally free to structure their posts as they like. Posts are\n+not expected to be \"all new content\", they can be simple updates from the last\n+post. Posts may also be more frequent, if there is significant updates to share.\n+\n+Historical examples of similar postings:\n+\n+- [@laanwj](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html)\n+- [@achow101](https://achow101.com/2020/10/0.21-wallets)\n+\n+\n+Below, each maintainer should keep up-to-date links of current and past\n+prioritization addresses (as well as any other useful materials in that\n+respect).\n+\n+#### @achow101\n+#### @fanquake\n+#### @hebasto\n+#### @laanwj\n+#### @marcofalke\n+#### @sipa\n+\n+Non maintainers may also share similar documents detailing their work here:\n+\n+\n+## Maintainers \"Moving On\"\n+\n+Maintainers may choose to cease being a maintainer at any time without notice.\n+Where possible, maintainers should try to gracefully transition out of their\n+role, until a new maintainer has been selected to replace them (if needed).\n+\n+## Maintainer Removal",

While imperfect, this\n+procedure ensures that access can be revoked quickly in the event of a\n+compromise, while preventing takeover by a single dev.\n+\n+Maintainers removal may be initiated by regular contributors (and maintainers)\n+by creating an issue (or post in other venue) asking the maintainer to resign\n+with a stated (arbitrary) reason (e.g., dereliction of duties, inactivity, bad\n+merges, etc). The maintainer should be placed on a temporary removal\n+simultaneously with this request, if it is judged to be reasonable by any other\n+maintainer. If there is no response within 2 weeks, the maintainer may be\n+removed by other maintainers. If the maintainer responds, and many regular\n+contributors do not retract their request for removal, other maintainers may,\n+at their discretion, remove the maintainer in question. If the maintainers\n+choose not to remove the maintainer, the regular contributors may choose to do\n+nothing, or to work on alternative Bitcoin implementations.\n+\n+Requests for removal are a last step, not a first step, depending on the\n+severity. A Maintainer Removal Issue should typically be accompanied by\n+citations of requests for the maintainer to do something differently to improve\n+that were rebuffed or ignored. For example, if the average PR time to merge is\n+3 months, and the bottleneck seems to be that the maintainer only merges PRs\n+once a month, contributors might reasonably request that the maintainer merge\n+PRs at least once a week if there is work that is ready to go. Should the\n+maintainer refuse, contributors might ask that they step down so that a more\n+active maintainer might step in. Or, if the issue is too few maintainers for",

I have shared 2 reasons above your comment:\r\n\r\n1. **Bias**: Alice and Bob are maintainers. Alice opens a pull request which is reviewed by others. Maintainers are humans and assessment of the reviews for this pull request can be different by Alice and Bob. Alice will have some bias to get it merged with 3 ACKs and Bob will look at all the comments, reviews, nits, possibility of bugs etc. before merging.\r\n\r\n2. **1 Extra review before merge:** In some cases it adds another review before merge by another maintainer. More reviews should never be a problem.\r\n\r\n",

However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release\n+\n+Maintainers are generally free to structure their posts as they like. Posts are\n+not expected to be \"all new content\", they can be simple updates from the last\n+post. Posts may also be more frequent, if there is significant updates to share.\n+\n+Historical examples of similar postings:\n+\n+- [@laanwj](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html)\n+- [@achow101](https://achow101.com/2020/10/0.21-wallets)\n+\n+\n+Below, each maintainer should keep up-to-date links of current and past\n+prioritization addresses (as well as any other useful materials in that\n+respect).\n+\n+#### @achow101\n+#### @fanquake\n+#### @hebasto\n+#### @laanwj\n+#### @marcofalke\n+#### @sipa\n+\n+Non maintainers may also share similar documents detailing their work here:\n+\n+\n+## Maintainers \"Moving On\"\n+\n+Maintainers may choose to cease being a maintainer at any time without notice.\n+Where possible, maintainers should try to gracefully transition out of their\n+role, until a new maintainer has been selected to replace them (if needed).\n+\n+## Maintainer Removal\n+\n+\n+Maintainers should be removed by other maintainers if there is any reason to\n+believe the maintainer or their keys may be compromised -- this removal can be\n+done temporarily by any single maintainer, unless there are only three\n+remaining maintainers (in which case removal requires 2, a majority), but\n+should be unanimously decided if permanent removal. While imperfect, this\n+procedure ensures that access can be revoked quickly in the event of a\n+compromise, while preventing takeover by a single dev.",

If Alice and Bob are maintainers, and self merges are not allowed, Alice informs Bob that they think the PR is ready to be merged.

However it is possible to be completely opaque to observers that there was bias because the communication from Alice to Bob may not be in a place that is public or publicly logged.

This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release",

The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work.

However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release",

However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.",

However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.",

Which is fine to mention, but at least I wouldn't open the section with that.

However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.",

The review process that\n+establishes general consensus is detailed in\n+[CONTRIBUTING.mg](/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, one Bitcoin's maintainers was a designated \"Lead Maintainer\",\n+which was most recently @laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the unofficial\n+title of Lead Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a\n+bug-not-feature if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over\n+other General Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+Typically, a PR authored by a maintainer will be merged by a different",
