      "body" : "Concept ACK. Thank you for working on this :rocket:  I plan to review this. I want to see e.g. what additional things we would need to consider when adding new tracepoints. A few first impressions, notes, and questions: \r\n\r\n- This looks like a cool PoC, but not really close to being ready for merge, especially with the custom patch :). Could also be a draft PR.\r\n- Awesome to see that we can re-use the same `TRACEx` macros we've already placed in the code. This was how I envisioned macOS (or Windows if possible) tracing support.\r\n\r\n>  and then apply the [probes-fix.diff](https://gist.github.com/kouloumos/df773b1e0896adca827e7960eace1d21) patch with git apply probes-fix.diff.\r\n- Would be good find a workaround for this. Did you create the patch manually? Can we change the tracepoints to improve this? I.e. not use `bool`?\r\n- Does `src/util/probes.h` need to be in version control or can it be generated during build time?\r\n- I was able to generate `src/util/probes.h` from `src/util/probes.d` on Linux, with `dtrace` supplied by Systemtap. However, it looks very different from your `probes.h` file. See [this](https://gist.github.com/0xB10C/655e506e9e53092f4becf412284f572a) gits.\r\n- It would be ideal if we could have a probes.d file that works for both Linux and macOS.\r\n- The `*_ENABLED()` in probes.h reminded me of https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work\r\n- We should check the macOS GUIX builds at some point to see if tracing works with them.\r\n- We'd probably want to document these steps in doc/tracing.md once we've figured something out that works well and doesn't add to much maintenance. Also, the *.d scripts can be mentioned under the example section.\r\n\r\ncc @jb55 ",

      "body" : "Thank you for the review @0xB10C! I am not happy with that custom patch either, but this being my first interaction with the build system, I was not sure what is consider acceptable. In retrospect, it is not and it adds unnecessary maintenance burden. \r\n\r\n> * Would be good find a workaround for this. Did you create the patch manually? Can we change the tracepoints to improve this? I.e. not use `bool`?\r\n\r\nIf what you mentioned at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#discussion_r913646086 is acceptable and we find a way to not use `bool` for the tracepoints, the generation of the header file could possibly become part of the build process. I avoided thinking about changing the `bool` type, mostly because of the [overhead](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#no-expensive-computations-for-tracepoints) that this might introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n> * Does `src/util/probes.h` need to be in version control or can it be generated during build time?\r\n...\r\n> * The `*_ENABLED()` in probes.h reminded me https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work\r\n\r\nLooking into the [probes_sdt branch](https://github.com/eklitzke/bitcoin/tree/probes_sdt) in that article, it seems that generating it during build time might be possible. This would possibly result to a probes.d file that works for both Linux and macOS. I initially avoided going that route because of the currently required changes (patch) after the file generation.\r\n\r\n> * I was able to generate `src/util/probes.h` from `src/util/probes.d` on Linux, with `dtrace` supplied by Systemtap. However, it looks very different from your `probes.h` file. See [this](https://gist.github.com/0xB10C/655e506e9e53092f4becf412284f572a) gits.\r\n\r\nI think being different makes sense as the resulting file has a different target os? My `probes.h` file is not the actual result of the command, as the committed file is after the manual changes shown in the patch. I've updated the [patch link](https://gist.github.com/kouloumos/df773b1e0896adca827e7960eace1d21) with the initial (before applying the patch) `probes.h` file. \r\n\r\n> * We'd probably want to document these steps in doc/tracing.md once we've figured something out that works well and doesn't add to much maintenance. Also, the *.d scripts can be mentioned under the example section.\r\n\r\nYes, I plan to enhance  the docs as soon as this works well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'll convert this to a draft PR until I find a way to get rid of the patch and in the meantime fix the failing checks. \r\nBest case scenario: replace `bool` > generate `util/probes` during build time > ð \r\n",

But anyway. with the current status of #26593, it doesn't make sense for this PR to be dealt with before that one is merged. Additionally, there is a chance that #26593 will make it easier to reason for macOS USDT support if [what I proposed ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#pullrequestreview-1376804705)gets into the final PR.\r\nTherefore, marking it as draft for now.\r\n",
