   "body" : "This PR adds macOS support for User-Space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) as well as dtrace example scripts based on the existing bpftrace scripts for Linux. This is tested on macOS 10.15. \r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of USDT only supports Linux  as the `DTRACE_PROBE*(context, event, ...args)` macros are not supported on macOS. As initially referenced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22238, the process of using USDT probes on macOS is slightly different and it's described in [the BUILDING CODE CONTAINING USDT PROBES section in the dtrace(1) manpage](https://gist.github.com/fanquake/e56c9866d53b326646d04ab43a8df9e2).\r\n\r\nThis more involved process includes\r\n\r\n1. Creating the providers description file `util/probes.d` which defines the providers and specifies their probes.\r\n2. Use `util/probes.d` to generate the header file `util/probes.h` with the neccesary tracepoints macros which are of the format `CONTEXT_EVENT(...args)`.\r\n3. Add the tracepoints macros to `util/trace.h`.\r\n\r\n##  Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n~Part of the macOS process is to create the providers description in a `.d` file. Therefore, types not supported by the D language (specifically `bool` and `std::byte`) cannot be used as part of the probe's signature. On those occasions, in lack of a better solution, only supported types are used and then a patch is applied at the generated `util/probes.h` file to replace the temporary D-supported types with those that we actually need.~\r\n\r\n~You can reproduce the initial header file by running `dtrace -h -s src/util/probes.d -o src/util/probes.h` (compiling with that results to errors because of not matching types) and then apply the [`probes-fix.diff`](https://gist.github.com/kouloumos/df773b1e0896adca827e7960eace1d21) patch with `git apply probes-fix.diff`.~\r\nEdit: `util/probes.h` is now generated during build time after changes (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#discussion_r913646086 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#discussion_r915192574) that removed the need for the non supported types.\r\n\r\nHaving the `bitcoind` binary compiled with USDT support, you can then use the dtrace example scripts `connectblock_benchmark.d`, `log_p2p_traffic.d`, `log_utxos.d` (root privileges needed) to test the macOS support. Extra documentation for those can be found at [contrib/tracing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/tracing) as they are functionally the same as the existing bpftrace scripts.\r\n\r\n### Adding tracepoints to Bitcoin Core (extra steps after this PR)\r\n\r\nAfter this PR when a new tracepoint is added, we will need to\r\n\r\n- Define the new probe for the tracepoint at `util/probes.d` together with a new provider if needed.\r\n- Add a new `#define context_event CONTEXT_EVENT`  macro at `util/trace.h`. This might not be final as discussed at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#discussion_r913611013. \r\n",
