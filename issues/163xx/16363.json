(Requested by ajtowns in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16333#issuecomment-508604071)\r\n\r\nWe can not add a test that a later duplicate tx overwrites a previous one, because BIP30 is always enforced on regtest. If someone feels strongly about such a test, some Bitcoin Core code would have to be modified, which can be done in a follow up pull request.\r\n\r\nAlso, add a commit to fix the BIP34 test failures reported in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14633#issue-227712540",
