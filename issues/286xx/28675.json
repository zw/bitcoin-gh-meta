This doesn't have to be bad since the hash of the UTXO set still matches, but it was new to me that two different dump files could both be valid and result in the same UTXO set.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to figure out yet why exactly this is the case though. From my understanding, the byte I am changing is the Coin `VARINT((coinbase ? 1 : 0) | (height << 1))`. The original value of the byte is `\\x82`, implying it's just the value in this one byte. Changing it should result in a different UTXO set. I must be missing something about the serialization of `Coin` or the `dumptxoutset` in general...",
