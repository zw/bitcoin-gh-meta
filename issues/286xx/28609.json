   "body" : "Some incomplete/incorrect state as a result of migration can be mitigated/cleaned up by simply restarting the migrated wallets. We already do this for a wallet when it is migrated, but we do not for the new watchonly and solvables wallets that may be created. This PR introduces this behavior, in addition to creating those wallets initially without an attached chain.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing this, I noticed that not all `CWalletTx` metadata was being copied over to the watchonly wallet and so some data, such as time received, was being lost. This PR fixes this as a side effect of not having a chain attached to the watchonly wallet. A test has also been added.",
