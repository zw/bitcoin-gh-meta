If after fixing the linting infrastructure we still need manual fix up PRs, they should happen whenever someone is sufficiently motivated to do it, and not be tied to a release process. Ideally, any future fix-up PRs should also include updates to the linting infrastructure to prevent the same type of errors from sneaking through.",

For example, when bumping the spellchecker version. This is problematic, because bumping this spellchecker usually comes with having to fight false positives, which doesn't seem worth it to load off on to pull request authors. Also, silent merge conflicts could mean that a reviewed pull request (ready for merge) has a failing CI shortly before merge, or worse, after merge. Finally, even absent the above issues, loading off the false positive fighting to pull request authors is not a good use of their time.\r\n\r\nunrelated: It could make sense to document this in the linter code, to avoid having to re-hash the discussion every two years.\r\n\r\nNo opinion on whether to add the false positive fighting to the release process. Whether or not it is added, no one is holding anyone back from fixing typos before the branch-off of a release.",
