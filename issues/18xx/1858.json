I waited a few more blocks and sent the transaction without having to pay the fee.\n\nThe message asking me to pay a fee didn't mention the blockchain not being synchronized. Users who are unaware of how fees are calculated could have paid an unnecessary fee to the network had they accepted prior to the client knowing that there was a way to send coins w/o the fee. Perhaps the error message could be modified to reflect this?\n\n**Laanwj: clarified issue title**\n",
