   "body" : "At the moment, if one accidentally performs a double-spent (or has a double-spent performed against them), the transaction is forever stored in the wallet.dat file and appears as a 0-confirmation transaction on top of the transaction history in BitcoinQT. There is no way to get rid of that transaction without purging the wallet through various workarounds through external software.\r\n\r\nI propose adding some option of deleting double-spent transactions once their paired transactions are buried deep in the blockchain (say, 120 confirmations). This would allow the users to clean their wallets from accidental double-spend transaction without enabling one an easier way to perform double-spent attacks by deleting an unconfirmed but a valid transaction.",
