As it is I think the format seems still \"black magic\".\n\nI'll add that you haven't really removed the internals of bignumber from the implementation: BN_num_bytes is based on the internal representation of BN. To make an example, BN_num_bytes of the 0 number is 0, while the .NET BigInteger serializes the 0 as a single { 0 } byte, and BN_num_bytes gives the length of the \"internal\" buffer of the BN, with the sign that is saved on another field, so BN_num_bytes(0xFF) == BN_num_bytes(-0xFF) == BN_num_bytes(0x7F) == BN_num_bytes(0x-7F) == 1.",

      "body" : "@xanatos: You're raising good questions and I've thus pushed an updated \"big comment\".\n\nOn testing the correctness of the implementation:  I've tested the equivalence of the old and new implementations for a reasonably big subset of all possible compact numbers.  While doing so I've benchmarked the new against the old implementation:  For sizes relevant to bitcoin the new implementation is ~80% faster.  For bigger sizes the speedup approaches ~900% due to the big intermediate value used by the old implementation.  Ã¢ÂÂ  Compact numbers are such a small part of bitcoin, their speed is almost irrelevant; I'm hoping the new implementation is easier to understand, the speedup is just a nice side effect.\n\nAbout endianness:  The \"compact\" representation is not a serialization into bytes, but a mapping into and out of an unsigned 32 bit number.  The endianness (= order of bytes when mapping a number to a sequence of bytes) is thus irrelevant.  However, bitcoin serializes `CBlock::nBits` like any other `unsigned long`.\n\nThe semantics of `BN_num_bytes(n)` is well documented and part of the interface of OpenSSL.  It is *not* the number of bytes used in a serialization of `n`, but the position of the most significant non-zero base256 digit of `n`.  It actually is implemented as `(BN_num_bits(n)+7)/8`.  (`BN_num_bits(10)` = 4 because decimal 10 = binary 1010)\n",
