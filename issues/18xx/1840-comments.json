Html/css is not supported in table cells, so greying out or hiding digits would require a custom delegate just as well.\n\nThe problem with bitcoin is the precision. In most cases in financial software you only want to show two digits to the right in these kinds of overviews, which doesn't look cluttered.\n\nHere, you want to show amounts of 10000 as well as 0.00001. Which would make the \"amount\" column requirement very wide, and result in empty space.  And adding .00000000 to all whole-bitcoin amounts *would* look cluttered.\n\n(doing this properly is not trivial... and how to gracefully fall back if there is not enough space to display all decimals? maybe 0.00...? either that or fall back to right-align in that case...)\n\n",
