From glancing at the code here it seems like `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock` would be the only needed RPCs. I've seen the discussion about separation (multi-process) in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049 but wasn't convinced by the arguments there (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049#issuecomment-926009122). I am worried about the maintenance burden of this and would prefer it being a separate thing.\r\n\r\nIf stratumv3 or \"some other cool new mining protocol\" comes out tomorrow, are we gonna add support for that too? In my opinion, Bitcoin Core's interfaces should accommodate projects like this but direct integration should be reserved for strictly necessary things.",

I can't think of anything that would not work by using the current interfaces or exposing extra functionality through them. For example, looking at Matt's comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049#issuecomment-926009122:\r\n\r\n> do things like pre-construct next-next-block templates in advance and push them out quicker\r\n\r\nThis is not something we currently support and would (afaik) require significant changes to our mining/mempool logic (entirely separate of any stratum v2 changes). Once we have that functionality we should expose it through our interfaces (e.g. zmq, rpc, rest) such that applications like stratum v2 can make use of it.\r\n\r\n> the inefficiencies of getblocktemplate have been a real source of pain for pool operators for some time, I'm excited its going away.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but the inefficiencies of `getblocktemplate` (for the most part) stem from the underlying mining algorithm's runtime complexity. This is not something that stratum v2 magically solves.",

      "body" : "I'm Concept ACK on eventually replacing the current `getblocktemplate` with another interface, for the following reasons:\r\n* The poll-based nature introduces unnecessary latency over a hypothetical push-based one.\r\n* Being RPC based, `getblocktemplate` is bandwidth and CPU inefficient due to JSON and hex encoding (for large amounts of data being transferred on every call).\r\n* `getblocktemplate` provides too much information for clients that do not care about performing their own transaction selection (full transaction hex and dependency information), with no way to opt out.\r\n\r\nNone of these deficiencies require the full StratumV2 approach to address; e.g. longpolling RPC could partially address the polling concern, a binary REST or ZMQ interface instead of RPC could address encoding issues, and additional RPC options to reduce verbosity could address that concern. Still, I don't think there was much impetus to improve upon these in an ecosystem that is `getblocktemplate`-based.\r\n\r\nIf (and that is an if) it is clear that the ecosystem is likely to adopt StratumV2, then I believe it makes sense to consider it as an interface too now. An alternative could still be a more \"neutral\" interface that is also push-based, binary, and efficient, and keep the StratumV2 logic as a separate daemon. That has advantages and disadvantages:\r\n\r\n* Advantages:\r\n  * Less complexity in Bitcoin Core to review and maintain.\r\n  * Less tied to the specific protocol, so wouldn't need Bitcoin Core changes when further protocol changes occur (as long as those don't introduce additional data requirements not exposed by the interface), perhaps making it easier to evolve StratumV2 (and/or successors).\r\n* Disadvantages:\r\n  * Slight efficiency/latency loss due to needing an additional process/layer to do the translation.\r\n  * Additional deployment friction (I do think it's important in general to make sure mining is as easy and efficient as possible, and having easily usable interfaces helps with that).\r\n  * In case a feature like outsourcing transaction selection is considered, I can imagine having one party performing the coinbase construction (the pool), and another performing transaction selection (the bitcoind talked to). In case this involves communicating e.g. the size/sigops of that coinbase to bitcoind for block construction, that may be harder to incorporate in a \"neutral\" protocol (it'd necessarily be bidirectional, while REST/ZMQ are inherently uni-directional I believe).\r\n\r\nI haven't reviewed StratumV2 itself, so I'm curious how people see these. Perhaps one can also consider different trade-offs in between \"`bitcoind` speaks the mining protocol directly\" and \"`bitcoind` only speaks a neutral interface\":\r\n* I assume what is considered in this PR is already only a subset of StratumV2 (as I remember there are multiple subprotocols, and I imagine not all of them are relevant to Bitcoin Core). But seeing things like Noise being part of the protocol, I do wonder if it's a possibility to just consider an unencrypted/unauthenticated subset, requiring a (perhaps much thinner) separate daemon to add that. Doing so may perhaps reduce the complexity to maintain in Bitcoin Core significantly.\r\n* Perhaps we see what is considered here as StratumV2 not so much as \"the\" mining protocol we expect everything to use, but just as the de facto binary interface protocol chosen because we need one anyway, and StratumV2 is already designed to cover the needs of such a protocol. If StratumV2 expansions/evolutions come along, or whatever other protocol, it may not be unreasonable to expect that to need a separate daemon that speaks StratumV2 with Bitcoin Core still.\r\n\r\n> This is not something we currently support and would (afaik) require significant changes to our mining/mempool logic (entirely separate of any stratum v2 changes). Once we have that functionality we should expose it through our interfaces (e.g. zmq, rpc, rest) such that applications like stratum v2 can make use of it.\r\n\r\nIt's true that we don't current support this, and that Stratum V2 does not magically solve this, but I do believe that part of the reason we don't is exactly because it's not that trivial in an RPC-based setting, and hard to move away from that in an ecosystem that's reliant on `getblocktemplate`. And in the long term, I do believe it's reasonable to consider at least the possibility of doing block template construction asynchronously in Bitcoin Core, because it is the one piece of infrastructure that has all the information to do so, and moving to such an approach enables for more computationally heavy block building without burdening the critical path.",

The fact that it comes under a \"StratumV2\" banner is somewhat unrelated, there's only some common framing. It's also not a substantial protocol, arguably simpler than getblocktemplate in full.\n\nThis protocol exists basically to create an alternative to getblocktemplate which solves key problems in it, and can be used with or without any other Stratumv2 content.\n\n* it is (much, much) lower bandwidth than getblocktemplate,\n* it explicitly moves decisions of when to switch to a new block to bitcoin core with a push model, rather than long polling which almost never gets used in practice. This allows for substantially better optimization of transaction selection and next-block switching across the ecosystem. This also implies we cannot build this das some kind of layer on the existing bitcoin core APIs, there needs to be something new.\n* it provides some cryptographic authentication, allowing the protocol to go over the open internet without fear - this allows the protocol to take the place of current systems like CK's \"solopool\", which allows miners to solo mine without the complexity of running a full node and pool stack, and can now be replicated by any full node. More generally, abstracting the block construction logic from a pool via a protocol which doesn't require tight integration could allow pools or miners with regulatory risk to use a third party template provider.\n\nThis protocol is certainly not set in stone, if someone has ideas for other goals that should be addressed or other protocol tweaks that can still happen at this phase, though ideally not a complete rewrite :).",

From glancing at the code here it seems like `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock` would be the only needed RPCs. I've seen the discussion about separation (multi-process) in #23049 but wasn't convinced by the arguments there (e.g. [#23049 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049#issuecomment-926009122)). I am worried about the maintenance burden of this and would prefer it being a separate thing.\r\n> \r\n> If stratumv3 or \"some other cool new mining protocol\" comes out tomorrow, are we gonna add support for that too? In my opinion, Bitcoin Core's interfaces should accommodate projects like this but direct integration should be reserved for strictly necessary things.\r\n\r\nThanks and appreciate the time for reviewing the PR. A lot of the points are valid especially concerns around maintenance burden and supporting numerous project integrations.\r\n\r\nIn terms of RPC calls, this is of course possible. With stratum v2 some of the goals are around improving performance and reducing latency. JSON RPC can fall short in speed and efficiency. If the sv2 TP were to be run as a separate   process that uses the existing RPC calls, then at a very high level we have the overhead:\r\n\r\n- Encoding Template fields to bytes\r\n- Encode bytes to HexStr\r\n- Build a JSON representation with HexStr fields\r\n- Serialize JSON representation to utf8 binary and send over the wire\r\n\r\nwhere as if sv2 provided templates:\r\n\r\n- Encode Template fields to bytes (sv2 encoding)\r\n- Send sv2 bytes over the wire\r\n\r\nThere are different approaches we could take, none of which I think has necessarily strong support for a particular direction but I guess the common goal would be, to be able to extract templates and submit work more efficiently with less overhead than the current RPCs available",

      "body" : "> In terms of RPC calls, this is of course possible. With stratum v2 some of the goals are around improving performance and reducing latency. JSON RPC can fall short in speed and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIts not just latency and overhead, however - one of the important goals of replacing GBT in Bitcoin Core broadly is to move towards everything being push, rather than polling. In general, block templates should come out of Bitcoin Core very aggressively - when a new block comes in and has been validated, before the mempool gets updated, we should be able to get a new block template out based on some prediction and conflict-removal, from there, we can update the mempool and then do a full new block generation, updating the template again. During steady-state, we should make decisions about when to update the block template based on new transactions (ignore 30-second-old transactions unless they have lots of fees, do a block template update immediately if a huge-fee transaction comes in, etc). This is important for long-term sustainability of Bitcoin Core as a block template constructor, and while GBT technically supports polling, I don't think any major production pool servers actually use it - it being optional means you can't make decisions like most of the above without assuming everyone uses GBT long-polling, which just isn't true.",

After studying more Stratum V2 and the inner details of mining operations, and in light of more âreactive\" block template construction in future in function of the processed mempool content, I think this more valuable to have Stratum V2 TP integrated in Bitcoin Core to enhance decentralization of the mining ecosystem. From a maintenance viewpoint, the changes are very âperipheralâ from other subsystem like the validation engine or the p2p stack so concept ACK to have Stratum V2 TP in Core.\r\n\r\n> Another architectural approach other than a new thread and server for the Sv2 TP might be preferred such as the current work in the [multiprocess project](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Process-Separation)\r\n\r\nIn the future, it might make sense to split the `bitcoin-node` process in a bunch of more granualr process (e.g `bitcoin-validation`, `bitcoin-server` with indexes, `bitcoin-p2p`) to avoid exposed DoS leakage between them or having redundance of some functionality like block-relay. What can be a good architecture/deployment fit for a âhobbyistâ full-node might not work for a substantial mining pool or Lightning Service Provider.",

      "body" : "Hi @Sjors , thanks and appreciate the review,\r\n\r\n> The PR description could use instructions on how to test this. Specifically I'd like to try it on mainnet against my vintage S9 with BraiinsOS+ (not sure which pools already support job negotiation/ announcement). This can of course point to existing documentation. [Config D](https://stratumprotocol.org/getting-started/#config-d-sv1-firmware--translation-proxy-jn-job-negotiator--sv2-pool) is close but it assumes regtest and running your own pool.\r\n\r\nFor this, honestly I'm not sure which would be the best configuration, I'll need to ask a few people that have done mainnet testing/testing with devices. I'll update the PR description once I find out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> It will also be easier to test and review this pull request if you add some functional tests. Maybe also add a `-debug=sv2` log category so it's easier to see what's happening.\r\n> \r\n> > There could be potential conflict with functional tests. [...] My guess is that it would be acceptable to disable the Sv2 TP when running functional tests [...]\r\n> \r\n> I think it's better to fix / improve these tests. Depending on the exact issue that could be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nYou're right, I'll work on setting up some functional tests and also adding the debug log category.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Imo this does not need to go behind a `--enable-template-provider` flag. Having `-stratumv2` off by default is enough. You're not adding a new dependency nor creating a new binary. Covering all possible configure flags in CI scales exponentially. Of course this ties into my previous point about tests.\r\n> \r\n> I'm seeing `CreateNewBlock()` messages now even when running without `-stratumv2`. That should probably be changed.\r\n> \r\n> When running with `-stratumv2` it says `Sv2 Template Provider listening on port: 0` so something is off with the default argument parsing there.\r\n\r\nThis makes more sense. I implemented this change removing the compile configuration flag and just used `-stratumv2` and `stratumv2port` with some default ports for each env. \r\n\r\nI think since there's a lot of changes in this one PR and noise to come, it would probably make sense to break this down into much smaller focused PRs? I think it would be much more beneficial for reviewers to consume and review smaller chunks of code.",

The pool incidentally rugged me because I don't have an account :-)\r\n* Job Declarator client running locally, connected to my node, and upstream to a testnet Job Declarator _server_\r\n\r\nI have not tried the censorship solo mining fallback yet (there's no easy way to trigger that without a test pool that censors).\r\n\r\nIt would be great to see _this_ PR updated with the latest stuff, and maybe also rebased.\r\n\r\nIn addition it would be useful to have an _up to date_ overview of what parts of the Stratum v2 spec are implemented in what part of the code here.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if we can keep the first iteration of this project poll based, e.g. the above linked branch just creates a template every 30 seconds and the Job Declarator client occasionally comes by and asks for it. The main changes to focus on would then be a new communication protocol and some new messages. Then a later pull request could figure out how to make it all push based. Since the existing `getblocktemplate` RPC is unaffected, it should be fine to ship work in progress and test-only stratum v2 functionality.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we completely figure out how to get everything right before merging anything.",
