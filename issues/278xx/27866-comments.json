A flush may fail once due to some sporadic error, but may succeed again at a later point in time. I'm still not sure though if it is really correct to ignore the flush error. If we fail to flush, but succeed in writing the block index, and then crash, we might have indexed a block, that has not been synced to disk. It also feels weird that we are currently okay with the block files failing to flush, while the call to `CoinsTip().Flush()` returns early on failure. Can you comment on this rationale?",

It could have a great rationale or just be weird like it appears to be.\r\n\r\nI'm less concerned about this PR than I am about #27861, which is treating flush errors as fatal errors when they are not inherently fatal. If code writing to disk fails it could either mean (1) state on disk is corrupt or invalid and can't be recovered from or (2) state on disk is valid but out of date and requires more work to catch up. These cases are inherently different and I think kernel API would benefit off having separate \"flush error\" and \"fatal error\" notifications to distinguish them, regardless of implementation details of current code.",

However, as I said [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1246307365) I am trying to keep this PR's scope limited to just the flush functions and their immediate call sites. I added the `[[nodiscard]]` to `FindBlockPos`, because it reports on the flush error now too. `FindUndoPos` on the other hand is not immediately affected by the flush errors. There are many such examples where we ignore error codes upon return throughout the kernel code and I'd like to tackle them bit by bit.",

Maybe your goal is to enhance libbitcoinkernel applications ability to handle and report errors, and my goal is to improve clarify of validation code and find to potential bugs in it. From my perspective, just adding `[[nodiscard]]` to function declarations and `(void)` to call sites along with \"// This error is intentionally ignored because ...\" and \"// This error is currently ignored but might be better to handle by ...\" comments would already be improvements. Maybe that doesn't go far enough though, or is more tangential to what this PR is trying to do.",

This seems to be safe because this `FindBlockPos` function only has one caller, `SaveBlockToDisk`, which only has two callers, `Chainstate::AcceptBlock` and `Chainstate::LoadGenesisBlock` which both seem to handle this error by stopping what they are doing and writing \"Failed to find position to write new block\" log messages. I did not look up `AcceptBlock` and `LoadGenesisBlock` callers but assume they are handling this case reasonably.\r\n\r\nI think existing log messages are vague / misleading, so would suggest adding a new log message here like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nLogPrintf(\"Failed to flush previous block file %05i (finalize=%i, finalize_undo=%i) before opening new block file %05i\", m_last_blockfile, !fKnown, finalize_undo, nFile)`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the benefits are of returning false here. I think unlike the other changes in this commit, this change doesn't help avoid any \"potential write from WriteBlockIndexDB that may refer to a block that is not fully flushed to disk yet\", because this flush call is happening after previous block data has already been successfully written and the database has already been updated.\r\n\r\nI think the clearest and most conservative thing to do would be to drop \"return false\" line in this commit, and only log an error message here. If you think returning false is a good idea, just do it in a followup commit decoupled from the other changes here with a commit message that explains why that is safe / desirable.",

I think it would be great to add a log print here, but if this this code is going to be changed to return false, I think that should happen in a separate followup commit, not combined with other changes here, and have a clear explanation and justification.\r\n\r\nIIUC, this change introduces an inconsistency. For all block data, and for vast majority of undo data, the data is considered to be successfully written if the write call succeeeds regardless of whether syncing and trimming succeeds later. But now with this change, for some small fraction of undo block data, the data will be considered not written if the syncing or trimming fails. And the fraction of blocks this will be true for will be essentially random due to the undo flush heuristic (described in a new [comment](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bitcoin/blob/03dfe04075668aa3b99a5d6d68adfcecffca0593/src/node/blockstorage.h#L129-L139) from #27746)\r\n\r\nI understand that your [goal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1254840912) here is to have libbitcoinkernel functions return more complete error information. I understand that goal is easier to achieve by changing behavior of validation and block storage code and returning early in certain cases. But fundamentally it is not necessary to change behavior of any existing code to have it return more error information. Without returning early, you can always accumulate errors and just return the error code at the end.\r\n\r\nIf returning early makes sense, I think it should be justified in its own terms and done carefully in smaller commits.",
