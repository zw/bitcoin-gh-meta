There are only 117 utxos currently, but the wallet.dat file is 370M.\r\n\r\nUsing the same wallet.dat file and (transaction history) `fundrawtransaction` saw a substantial speedup:\r\n ~5 seconds using v25.99.0-a36134fcc7b4\r\n ~20 milliseconds using v25.99.0-d9c4dcfe68c5 (latest [wallet-unspent-txos](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/d9c4dcfe68c547d23f7687e5f0e9db363aa3b460))\r\n\r\nI will try to recreate my large test wallet.dat file tomorrow so I can confirm the steps to reproduce it. Is there anything in particular I can do to help? Would you like more testing? code review?\r\n\r\nNB: I had to export my original wallet descriptors and re-import them to work around the issue fixed in [#27920](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27920#pullrequestreview-1608551611). Before the export/import the wallet.dat file was 1.1G, but the speed of `fundrawtransaction` was 5 sec both in the original file and the tested one created via importing descriptors.",
