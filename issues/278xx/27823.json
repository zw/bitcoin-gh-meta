   "body" : "When the block index database is non-contiguous due to file corruption (i.e. it contains indexes of height `x-1` and `x+1`, but not `x`), bitcoind can currently crash with an assert in `BuildSkip()` / `GetAncestor()` during `BlockManager::LoadBlockIndex()`:\r\n```\r\nbitcoind: chain.cpp:112: const CBlockIndex* CBlockIndex::GetAncestor(int) const: Assertion `pindexWalk->pprev' failed.\r\n```\r\nThis PR changes it such that we instead return an `InitError` to the user.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon this because I noticed that the file perturbation in `feature_init.py`  wasn't working as intended, which is fixed in the second commit:\r\n* Opening the file twice in one `with` statement would lead to `tf_read` being empty, so the test wouldn't perturb anything but replace the file with a new one. Fixed by first opening for read, then for write.\r\n* We need to restore the previous state after perturbations, so that only the current perturbation is active and not a mix of the current and previous ones.\r\n* I also added `checkblocks=200` to the startup parameters so that corruption in earlier blocks of `blk00000.dat` is detected during init verification and not ignored.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing `feature_init.py` like that I'd run into the `assert` mentioned above (so running the testfix from the second commit without the first one is a way to reproduce it).",
