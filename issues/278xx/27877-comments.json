      "body" : "Thanks for exploring this, I think this is an interesting idea! I'll comment based on my specific usage of the wallet for lightning service providers, please bear in mind that this is a very specific use case that is quite different from regular users (see #24795 for early details about this).\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the current goals of coin selection are that it tries to find a good balance between minimizing fees and consolidating utxos. The latter actually helps the former: consolidating utxos is usually good for performance, and if you do it when fees are low, you will avoid paying more fees in the future when fees are higher because you'll be able to use less inputs in your future transactions.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a lightning service provider, we'd rather avoid consolidating utxos, and are ready to pay more fees to keep a large enough utxo set to satisfy our users' needs. The main reasons for that are that:\r\n\r\n- we are using 0-conf (in a setup where the user is trusting us to not double-spend)\r\n- we are using low fees for those transactions (it's ok to keep transactions unconfirmed until the mempool clears, this is how we can keep the cost low for users)\r\n- the change outputs from most of those transactions are _unsafe_ because they may be double-spent by a commitment transaction (and thus generally unusable until the the transaction confirms, except when used for that same user)\r\n\r\nThat last point is a consequence of [splicing](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/863), let me know if you want me to explain that point in more details.\r\n\r\nIf we run out of _safe_ utxos, we cannot onboard new users, which may require us to transfer funds from a cold wallet while making sure we're creating many utxos, at a time where the on-chain fees may be high. Our ideal wallet would maintain a large pool of utxos of various sizes, to ensure we're always ready to onboard new users or sell liquidity to existing users.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is the opposite of what most end users want and can't be achieved by the same algorithm: that's why I would find it very useful to have various coin selection algorithms in bitcoin core, that are tuned to different profiles/scenarios. I like that this algorithm feels like something we could use (at all feerates) to keep a wallet state that makes more sense for us.",

Your comment inspired a small optimization. \r\nCoinGrinder has been simplified by keeping only track of the input weight (instead of weight and waste), and minimizing input weight throughout. This reduced the number of parameters necessary to call CoinGrinder, simplified the input set traversal, and allows CoinGrinder to be used at all feerates instead of just high feerates.

      "body" : "@dergoegge: Thanks, I discovered the issue myself over the weekend and was exploring yesterday whether I could come up with another optimization. In the end, I fixed the fuzz test by only comparing the weight with SRD and Knapsack when CoinGrinder actually concluded searching the combination space exhaustively. Since finding the lowest weight input set is an NP-hard problem, itâs clearly expected that we can generate UTXO pools for which CoinGrinder will not be able to finish the search in 100k attempts, it was naÃ¯ve to expect that the fuzz test wouldnât eventually find such a case.\r\n\r\nYour crash seed passes now.\r\n\r\nIâm sorry Iâm only seeing your comment after pushing the fix.",

We do see the walletâs UTXO pool quickly contract whenever the feerates are reduced to lower levels: \r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/4060799/87223918-eb26-44da-ab23-a96fd72ab23a)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see in a second simulation that uses the same payment scenario but a series of much lower feerates (\"Peak and tail\") that the UTXO pool size is only slightly elevated when a larger portion of the transactions is performed at feerates below the _long-term feerate estimate_. We see that the addition of CoinGrinder reduces the total fees by about 4% due to better performance in the infrequent high feerate payments.\r\n\r\n| Branch | Mean UTXO count | Total Fees paid | Change outputs created | Solutions found by |\r\n| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `master` | 32.70 |0.10775743 | 4556 | knapsack: 3636 ; srd: 920 ; bnb: 449 |\r\n| `CoinGrinder` | 34.31 | 0.10326806 | 4538 | knapsack: 3593 ; srd: 554 ; bnb: 467;â¯cg: 391 |\r\n\r\nPlease see this [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/gutterguard-and-coingrinder-simulation-results/279) thread for the complete description of the simulation and results.",

      "body" : "Thanks, I did some hard staring at this while-loop. I restructured it to use a `break` as you suggested, and was able to reduce the loopâs condition to:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-            while (!should_shift && next_utxo > 0\r\n-                    && (curr_selection.empty() || curr_selection.back() != next_utxo - 1)\r\n-                    && utxo_pool[next_utxo - 1].GetSelectionAmount() == utxo_pool[next_utxo].GetSelectionAmount()\r\n+            while (utxo_pool[next_utxo - 1].GetSelectionAmount() == utxo_pool[next_utxo].GetSelectionAmount()\r\n                     && utxo_pool[next_utxo - 1].fee == utxo_pool[next_utxo].fee) {\r\n-                if (next_utxo < utxo_pool.size() - 1) {\r\n-                    // Skip clone: previous UTXO is equivalent and unselected\r\n-                    ++next_utxo;\r\n-                } else {\r\n+                if (next_utxo >= utxo_pool.size() - 1) {\r\n                     // Reached end of UTXO pool skipping clones: SHIFT instead\r\n                     should_shift = true;\r\n+                    break;\r\n                 }\r\n+                // Skip clone: previous UTXO is equivalent and unselected\r\n+                ++next_utxo;\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n```\r\nOriginally, when I introduced clone skipping, I missed that it could only occur after a SHIFT, so there were some unnecessary checks here. Clearly `next_utxo` has to be greater than 0, since it was just incremented in the SHIFT. We also donât have to check whether the `current_selection.back()` is the last element of the UTXO pool, we would have cut if that were the case. So, we only have to check for clones.\r\n\r\nIâm actually just realizing that I might also be able to drop the `fee` comparison. We already break ties between UTXOs of the same selection amount in favor of less weight, so the preceding UTXO must always have the same fee or a lower fee. While a UTXO with a greater fee (i.e. greater weight) and the same selection amount would not strictly be a clone, it can only lead to a worse input set than the predecessor that we have already evaluated. Gonna ponder and test, will perhaps fix up later today.",

Fixed by explicitly checking that weight is tied.\r\n\r\nMy argument for preferring an input set with less funds is that the walletâs confirmed balance is reduced less and therefore the wallet has more confirmed liquidity (that is not constrained by e.g. needing to bump a lower feerate parent transaction) in case this transaction doesnât get confirmed immediately.",

      "body" : "I think you should set the number of tries to be at least some multiple of the utxo_pool size, because (a) without it, you can't guarantee even considering every UTXO, and (b) the runtime of coin selection overall already contains a component proportional to the size of utxo_pool (simply the cost of constructing the pool in the first place) anyway. So I would suggest something like `const auto total_tries = max(TOTAL_TRIES_CG, 10 * utxo_pool.size());` or so.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth doing this as a follow-up, as other algorithms may benefit from a similar treatment. Still, I'd suggest using a separate constant `TOTAL_TRIES_CG`, even if you also set it to 100000 for now, because there is no inherent reason why BNB and CG should have the same iteration count limit (their time per iteration, and certainly their \"solving power\" per iteration, is possibly quite different).",

We can represent the current state of the search with constant data thanks to\n+ * visiting the nodes in a deterministic order. We skip visiting as many nodes as possible by recognizing subtrees that\n+ * cannot yield any better solutions.\n+ * CoinGrinder is searching for the input set with lowest weight that can fund a transaction, so for example we can only\n+ * ever find a _better_ candidate input set in a node that adds a UTXO, but never in a node that skips a UTXO. After\n+ * visiting {A} and exploring the inclusion branch {AB} and its descendants, the candidate input set in the omission\n+ * branch {A_} is equivalent to the parent {A} in effective value and weight.

(The index of the ultimate element in the candidate input set\n+ * shifts right by one: {AB} â {A_C}.)\n+ * When we reach a leaf node in the last level of the tree, shifting to the omission branch is not possible. Instead we\n+ * go to the omission branch of the nodeâs last ancestor on an inclusion branch: from {ABCD}, we go to {AB_D}. From\n+ * {AB_D}, we go to {A_C}. We refer to this operation as a _CUT_. (The ultimate element in\n+ * the input set is deselected, and the penultimate element is shifted right by one: {AB_D} â {A_C}.)\n+ * If a candidate input set in a node has not selected enough to fund a transaction, we continue directly along the next\n+ * inclusion branch. We call this operation _EXPLORE_. (We go from one inclusion branch to the next inclusion branch:\n+ * {_B} â {_BC}.)\n+ * Further, any prefix that already has selected sufficient effective value to fund the transaction cannot be improved\n+ * by adding more UTXOs. If for example the candidate input set in {AB} is a valid solution, all potential descendant\n+ * solutions {ABC}, {ABCD}, and {AB_D} must have a higher weight.\n+ *\n+ * Given the above UTXO set and a target of 11, using these initial observations, the basic implementation of\n+* CoinGrinder visits the following 10 nodes:\n+ *\n+ *     Node   [eff_val/weight]  Evaluation\n+ *     -------------------\n+ *     {A}    [10/2]   Insufficient funds: EXPLORE\n+ *     {AB}   [17/3]   Solution: SHIFT to omission branch\n+ *     {A_C}  [15/3]   Better solution: SHIFT to omission branch\n+ *     {A__D} [14/4]   Worse solution, shift impossible due to leaf node: CUT to omission branch of {A__D}, i.e. SHIFT\n+ *                     to omission branch of {A}\n+ *     {_B}   [7/1]    Insufficient funds: EXPLORE\n+ *     {_BC}  [12/2]   Better solution: SHIFT to omission branch\n+ *     {_B_D} [11/3]   Worse solution, shift impossible due to leaf node: CUT to omission branch of {_B_D}, i.e. SHIFT\n+ *                     to omission branch of {_B}\n+ *     {__C}  [5/1]    Insufficient funds: EXPLORE\n+ *     {__CD} [9/3]    Insufficient funds, leaf node: CUT\n+ *     {___D} [4/2]    Insufficient funds, leaf node, cannot CUT since only one UTXO selected: done.\n+ *\n+ *                                       _______________________ {} ________________________\n+ *                                      /                                                   \\\n+ * A=[10/2]               __________ {A} _________                                ___________\\____________\n+ *                       /                        \\                              /                        \\\n+ * B=[7/1]            {AB}                       __\\_____                     {_B} __                    __\\_____\n+ *                                              /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\\n+ * C=[5/1]                                 {A_C}          \\            {_BC}          \\            {__C}          \\\n+ *                                                        /                           /             /             /\n+ * D=[4/2]                                           {A__D}                      {_B_D}        {__CD}        {___D}\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * We implement this tree walk in the following algorithm:\n+ * 1.

The algorithm is similar to the Branch and Bound algorithm, but will produce a transaction _with_ a\n+ * change output instead of a changeless transaction.\n+ *\n+ * Full description: CoinGrinder can be thought of as a graph walking algorithm. It explores a binary tree\n+ * representation of the powerset of the UTXO pool. Each node in the tree represents a candidate input set. The treeâs\n+ * root is the empty set. Each node in the tree has two children which are formed by either adding or skipping the next\n+ * UTXO (\"inclusion/omission branch\"). Each level in the tree after the root corresponds to a decision\n+ * about one UTXO in the UTXO pool.\n+ *\n+ * Example:\n+ * We represent UTXOs as _alias=[effective_value/weight]_ and indicate omitted UTXOs with an underscore. Given a UTXO\n+ * pool {A=[10/2], B=[7/1], C=[5/1], D=[4/2]} sorted by descending effective value, our search tree looks as follows:\n+ *\n+ *                                       _______________________ {} ________________________\n+ *                                      /                                                   \\\n+ * A=[10/2]               __________ {A} _________                                __________ {_} _________\n+ *                       /                        \\                              /                        \\\n+ * B=[7/1]            {AB} _                      {A_} _                      {_B} _                      {__} _\n+ *                  /       \\                   /       \\                   /       \\                   /       \\\n+ * C=[5/1]     {ABC}         {AB_}         {A_C}         {A__}         {_BC}         {_B_}         {__C}         {___}\n+ *              / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\\n+ * D=[4/2] {ABCD} {ABC_} {AB_D} {AB__} {A_CD} {A_C_} {A__D} {A___} {_BCD} {_BC_} {_B_D} {_B__} {__CD} {__C_} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * CoinGrinder uses a depth-first search to walk the tree. It first tries inclusion branches, then omission branches. A\n+ * naive exploration of a tree with four UTXOs requires visiting all 31 nodes:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {ABC_} {AB_} {AB_D} {AB__} {A_} {A_C} {A_CD} {A_C_} {A__} {A__D} {A___} {_} {_B} {_BC}\n+ *     {_BCD} {_BC_} {_B_} {_B_D} {_B__} {__} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ * As powersets grow exponentially with the set size, walking the entire tree would quickly get computationally\n+ * infeasible with growing UTXO pools. We can represent the current state of the search with constant data thanks to\n+ * visiting the nodes in a deterministic order. We skip visiting as many nodes as possible by recognizing subtrees that\n+ * cannot yield any better solutions.\n+ * CoinGrinder is searching for the input set with lowest weight that can fund a transaction, so for example we can only\n+ * ever find a _better_ candidate input set in a node that adds a UTXO, but never in a node that skips a UTXO.

It first tries inclusion branches, then omission branches. A\n+ * naive exploration of a tree with four UTXOs requires visiting all 31 nodes:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {ABC_} {AB_} {AB_D} {AB__} {A_} {A_C} {A_CD} {A_C_} {A__} {A__D} {A___} {_} {_B} {_BC}\n+ *     {_BCD} {_BC_} {_B_} {_B_D} {_B__} {__} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ * As powersets grow exponentially with the set size, walking the entire tree would quickly get computationally\n+ * infeasible with growing UTXO pools. We can represent the current state of the search with constant data thanks to\n+ * visiting the nodes in a deterministic order. We skip visiting as many nodes as possible by recognizing subtrees that\n+ * cannot yield any better solutions.\n+ * CoinGrinder is searching for the input set with lowest weight that can fund a transaction, so for example we can only\n+ * ever find a _better_ candidate input set in a node that adds a UTXO, but never in a node that skips a UTXO. After\n+ * visiting {A} and exploring the inclusion branch {AB} and its descendants, the candidate input set in the omission\n+ * branch {A_} is equivalent to the parent {A} in effective value and weight. While CoinGrinder does need to visit the\n+ * descendants of the omission branch {A_}, it is unnecessary to evaluate the candidate input set in the omission branch\n+ * itself. By skipping evaluation of all nodes on an omission branch we reduce the visited nodes to 15:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {AB_D} {A_C} {A_CD} {A__D} {_B} {_BC} {_BCD} {_B_D} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ *                                       _______________________ {} ________________________\n+ *                                      /                                                   \\\n+ * A=[10/2]               __________ {A} _________                                ___________\\____________\n+ *                       /                        \\                              /                        \\\n+ * B=[7/1]            {AB} __                    __\\_____                     {_B} __                    __\\_____\n+ *                  /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\\n+ * C=[5/1]     {ABC}          \\            {A_C}          \\            {_BC}          \\            {__C}          \\\n+ *              /             /             /             /             /             /             /             /\n+ * D=[4/2] {ABCD}        {AB_D}        {A_CD}        {A__D}        {_BCD}        {_B_D}        {__CD}        {___D}\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * We refer to the move from the inclusion branch {AB} via the omission branch {A_} to its inclusion-branch child {A_C}\n+ * as _shifting to the omission branch_ or just _SHIFT_.

Instead we\n+ * go to the omission branch of the nodeâs last ancestor on an inclusion branch: from {ABCD}, we go to {AB_D}. From\n+ * {AB_D}, we go to {A_C}. We refer to this operation as a _CUT_. (The ultimate element in\n+ * the input set is deselected, and the penultimate element is shifted right by one: {AB_D} â {A_C}.)\n+ * If a candidate input set in a node has not selected enough to fund a transaction, we continue directly along the next\n+ * inclusion branch. We call this operation _EXPLORE_. (We go from one inclusion branch to the next inclusion branch:\n+ * {_B} â {_BC}.)\n+ * Further, any prefix that already has selected sufficient effective value to fund the transaction cannot be improved\n+ * by adding more UTXOs.

A\n+ * naive exploration of a tree with four UTXOs requires visiting all 31 nodes:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {ABC_} {AB_} {AB_D} {AB__} {A_} {A_C} {A_CD} {A_C_} {A__} {A__D} {A___} {_} {_B} {_BC}\n+ *     {_BCD} {_BC_} {_B_} {_B_D} {_B__} {__} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ * As powersets grow exponentially with the set size, walking the entire tree would quickly get computationally\n+ * infeasible with growing UTXO pools. We can represent the current state of the search with constant data thanks to\n+ * visiting the nodes in a deterministic order. We skip visiting as many nodes as possible by recognizing subtrees that\n+ * cannot yield any better solutions.\n+ * CoinGrinder is searching for the input set with lowest weight that can fund a transaction, so for example we can only\n+ * ever find a _better_ candidate input set in a node that adds a UTXO, but never in a node that skips a UTXO. After\n+ * visiting {A} and exploring the inclusion branch {AB} and its descendants, the candidate input set in the omission\n+ * branch {A_} is equivalent to the parent {A} in effective value and weight. While CoinGrinder does need to visit the\n+ * descendants of the omission branch {A_}, it is unnecessary to evaluate the candidate input set in the omission branch\n+ * itself. By skipping evaluation of all nodes on an omission branch we reduce the visited nodes to 15:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {AB_D} {A_C} {A_CD} {A__D} {_B} {_BC} {_BCD} {_B_D} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ *                                       _______________________ {} ________________________\n+ *                                      /                                                   \\\n+ * A=[10/2]               __________ {A} _________                                ___________\\____________\n+ *                       /                        \\                              /                        \\\n+ * B=[7/1]            {AB} __                    __\\_____                     {_B} __                    __\\_____\n+ *                  /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\\n+ * C=[5/1]     {ABC}          \\            {A_C}          \\            {_BC}          \\            {__C}          \\\n+ *              /             /             /             /             /             /             /             /\n+ * D=[4/2] {ABCD}        {AB_D}        {A_CD}        {A__D}        {_BCD}        {_B_D}        {__CD}        {___D}\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * We refer to the move from the inclusion branch {AB} via the omission branch {A_} to its inclusion-branch child {A_C}\n+ * as _shifting to the omission branch_ or just _SHIFT_. (The index of the ultimate element in the candidate input set\n+ * shifts right by one: {AB} â {A_C}.)\n+ * When we reach a leaf node in the last level of the tree, shifting to the omission branch is not possible. Instead we\n+ * go to the omission branch of the nodeâs last ancestor on an inclusion branch: from {ABCD}, we go to {AB_D}. From\n+ * {AB_D}, we go to {A_C}. We refer to this operation as a _CUT_. (The ultimate element in\n+ * the input set is deselected, and the penultimate element is shifted right by one: {AB_D} â {A_C}.)\n+ * If a candidate input set in a node has not selected enough to fund a transaction, we continue directly along the next\n+ * inclusion branch. We call this operation _EXPLORE_. (We go from one inclusion branch to the next inclusion branch:\n+ * {_B} â {_BC}.)\n+ * Further, any prefix that already has selected sufficient effective value to fund the transaction cannot be improved\n+ * by adding more UTXOs. If for example the candidate input set in {AB} is a valid solution, all potential descendant\n+ * solutions {ABC}, {ABCD}, and {AB_D} must have a higher weight.\n+ *\n+ * Given the above UTXO set and a target of 11, using these initial observations, the basic implementation of\n+* CoinGrinder visits the following 10 nodes:\n+ *\n+ *     Node   [eff_val/weight]  Evaluation\n+ *     -------------------\n+ *     {A}    [10/2]   Insufficient funds: EXPLORE\n+ *     {AB}   [17/3]   Solution: SHIFT to omission branch\n+ *     {A_C}  [15/3]   Better solution: SHIFT to omission branch\n+ *     {A__D} [14/4]   Worse solution, shift impossible due to leaf node: CUT to omission branch of {A__D}, i.e. SHIFT\n+ *                     to omission branch of {A}\n+ *     {_B}   [7/1]    Insufficient funds: EXPLORE\n+ *     {_BC}  [12/2]   Better solution: SHIFT to omission branch\n+ *     {_B_D} [11/3]   Worse solution, shift impossible due to leaf node: CUT to omission branch of {_B_D}, i.e. SHIFT\n+ *                     to omission branch of {_B}\n+ *     {__C}  [5/1]    Insufficient funds: EXPLORE\n+ *     {__CD} [9/3]    Insufficient funds, leaf node: CUT\n+ *     {___D} [4/2]    Insufficient funds, leaf node, cannot CUT since only one UTXO selected: done.\n+ *\n+ *                                       _______________________ {} ________________________\n+ *                                      /                                                   \\\n+ * A=[10/2]               __________ {A} _________                                ___________\\____________\n+ *                       /                        \\                              /                        \\\n+ * B=[7/1]            {AB}                       __\\_____                     {_B} __                    __\\_____\n+ *                                              /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\\n+ * C=[5/1]                                 {A_C}          \\            {_BC}          \\            {__C}          \\\n+ *                                                        /                           /             /             /\n+ * D=[4/2]                                           {A__D}                      {_B_D}        {__CD}        {___D}\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * We implement this tree walk in the following algorithm:\n+ * 1.

(The index of the ultimate element in the candidate input set\n+ * shifts right by one: {AB} â {A_C}.)\n+ * When we reach a leaf node in the last level of the tree, shifting to the omission branch is not possible. Instead we\n+ * go to the omission branch of the nodeâs last ancestor on an inclusion branch: from {ABCD}, we go to {AB_D}. From\n+ * {AB_D}, we go to {A_C}. We refer to this operation as a _CUT_. (The ultimate element in\n+ * the input set is deselected, and the penultimate element is shifted right by one: {AB_D} â {A_C}.)\n+ * If a candidate input set in a node has not selected enough to fund a transaction, we continue directly along the next\n+ * inclusion branch. We call this operation _EXPLORE_. (We go from one inclusion branch to the next inclusion branch:\n+ * {_B} â {_BC}.)\n+ * Further, any prefix that already has selected sufficient effective value to fund the transaction cannot be improved\n+ * by adding more UTXOs. If for example the candidate input set in {AB} is a valid solution, all potential descendant\n+ * solutions {ABC}, {ABCD}, and {AB_D} must have a higher weight.\n+ *\n+ * Given the above UTXO set and a target of 11, using these initial observations, the basic implementation of\n+* CoinGrinder visits the following 10 nodes:",

By skipping evaluation of all nodes on an omission branch we reduce the visited nodes to 15:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {AB_D} {A_C} {A_CD} {A__D} {_B} {_BC} {_BCD} {_B_D} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ *                                       _______________________ {} ________________________\n+ *                                      /                                                   \\\n+ * A=[10/2]               __________ {A} _________                                ___________\\____________\n+ *                       /                        \\                              /                        \\\n+ * B=[7/1]            {AB} __                    __\\_____                     {_B} __                    __\\_____\n+ *                  /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\                  /        \\\n+ * C=[5/1]     {ABC}          \\            {A_C}          \\            {_BC}          \\            {__C}          \\\n+ *              /             /             /             /             /             /             /             /\n+ * D=[4/2] {ABCD}        {AB_D}        {A_CD}        {A__D}        {_BCD}        {_B_D}        {__CD}        {___D}\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * We refer to the move from the inclusion branch {AB} via the omission branch {A_} to its inclusion-branch child {A_C}\n+ * as _shifting to the omission branch_ or just _SHIFT_. (The index of the ultimate element in the candidate input set\n+ * shifts right by one: {AB} â {A_C}.)\n+ * When we reach a leaf node in the last level of the tree, shifting to the omission branch is not possible. Instead we\n+ * go to the omission branch of the nodeâs last ancestor on an inclusion branch: from {ABCD}, we go to {AB_D}. From\n+ * {AB_D}, we go to {A_C}. We refer to this operation as a _CUT_. (The ultimate element in\n+ * the input set is deselected, and the penultimate element is shifted right by one: {AB_D} â {A_C}.)\n+ * If a candidate input set in a node has not selected enough to fund a transaction, we continue directly along the next\n+ * inclusion branch. We call this operation _EXPLORE_. (We go from one inclusion branch to the next inclusion branch:\n+ * {_B} â {_BC}.)\n+ * Further, any prefix that already has selected sufficient effective value to fund the transaction cannot be improved\n+ * by adding more UTXOs. If for example the candidate input set in {AB} is a valid solution, all potential descendant\n+ * solutions {ABC}, {ABCD}, and {AB_D} must have a higher weight.\n+ *\n+ * Given the above UTXO set and a target of 11, using these initial observations, the basic implementation of\n+* CoinGrinder visits the following 10 nodes:",

The algorithm is similar to the Branch and Bound algorithm, but will produce a transaction _with_ a\n+ * change output instead of a changeless transaction.\n+ *\n+ * Full description: CoinGrinder can be thought of as a graph walking algorithm. It explores a binary tree\n+ * representation of the powerset of the UTXO pool. Each node in the tree represents a candidate input set. The treeâs\n+ * root is the empty set. Each node in the tree has two children which are formed by either adding or skipping the next\n+ * UTXO (\"inclusion/omission branch\"). Each level in the tree after the root corresponds to a decision\n+ * about one UTXO in the UTXO pool.\n+ *\n+ * Example:\n+ * We represent UTXOs as _alias=[effective_value/weight]_ and indicate omitted UTXOs with an underscore. Given a UTXO\n+ * pool {A=[10/2], B=[7/1], C=[5/1], D=[4/2]} sorted by descending effective value, our search tree looks as follows:\n+ *\n+ *                                       _______________________ {} ________________________\n+ *                                      /                                                   \\\n+ * A=[10/2]               __________ {A} _________                                __________ {_} _________\n+ *                       /                        \\                              /                        \\\n+ * B=[7/1]            {AB} _                      {A_} _                      {_B} _                      {__} _\n+ *                  /       \\                   /       \\                   /       \\                   /       \\\n+ * C=[5/1]     {ABC}         {AB_}         {A_C}         {A__}         {_BC}         {_B_}         {__C}         {___}\n+ *              / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\           / \\\n+ * D=[4/2] {ABCD} {ABC_} {AB_D} {AB__} {A_CD} {A_C_} {A__D} {A___} {_BCD} {_BC_} {_B_D} {_B__} {__CD} {__C_} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ *\n+ * CoinGrinder uses a depth-first search to walk the tree. It first tries inclusion branches, then omission branches. A\n+ * naive exploration of a tree with four UTXOs requires visiting all 31 nodes:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {ABC_} {AB_} {AB_D} {AB__} {A_} {A_C} {A_CD} {A_C_} {A__} {A__D} {A___} {_} {_B} {_BC}\n+ *     {_BCD} {_BC_} {_B_} {_B_D} {_B__} {__} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___} {___D} {____}\n+ *\n+ * As powersets grow exponentially with the set size, walking the entire tree would quickly get computationally\n+ * infeasible with growing UTXO pools. We can represent the current state of the search with constant data thanks to\n+ * visiting the nodes in a deterministic order. We skip visiting as many nodes as possible by recognizing subtrees that\n+ * cannot yield any better solutions.\n+ * CoinGrinder is searching for the input set with lowest weight that can fund a transaction, so for example we can only\n+ * ever find a _better_ candidate input set in a node that adds a UTXO, but never in a node that skips a UTXO. After\n+ * visiting {A} and exploring the inclusion branch {AB} and its descendants, the candidate input set in the omission\n+ * branch {A_} is equivalent to the parent {A} in effective value and weight. While CoinGrinder does need to visit the\n+ * descendants of the omission branch {A_}, it is unnecessary to evaluate the candidate input set in the omission branch\n+ * itself. By skipping evaluation of all nodes on an omission branch we reduce the visited nodes to 15:\n+ *\n+ *     {} {A} {AB} {ABC} {ABCD} {AB_D} {A_C} {A_CD} {A__D} {_B} {_BC} {_BCD} {_B_D} {__C} {__CD} {__C} {___D} {____}",

      "body" : "@murchandamus Let me elaborate for context, but no point in addressing this in this PR (after my edit, I don't think it's a particularly impactful improvement even).\r\n\r\nLet's say the transactions, in order after sorting are A,B,C,D,E,F. Imagine we've just processed `_BC`, and SHIFT after it (so, without clone skipping, the next exploration would be `_B_D`). If it happens to be the case that D is unambiguously worse than C, then D can be skipped as well. This happens when value(D)=value(C) AND weight(D)>=weight(C) (as your current PR does; the latter condition being implied by sorting), but it also happens when value(D)<value(C) AND weight(D)>weight(C). If we wouldn't care about minimizing value overshoot, it'd be even possible to skip whenever weight(D)>=weight(C) in general, which would be far more often applicable.\r\n\r\nOk, so let's say for any of the reasons above, `_B_D` was clone-skipped, so we're now considering E as next_utxo. It suffices to compare E with C, rather than with D, because it's possible that weight(E)>weight(C), but not weight(E)>weight(D).\r\n\r\nSo my belief is that the rule can be that whenever next_utxo is unambiguously worse than the first omitted UTXO *without intervening inclusions*, it can be skipped, as a generalization of clone skipping. I haven't tried it, though.\r\n\r\n> Also, isnât that just pre-empting the overweight check in the evaluation?\r\n\r\nPartially, but clone-skipping works on just individual UTXOs, not just when an entire subtree can be skipped. It's possible that after the clone-skipping another, includable, UTXO still needs to be considered.",
