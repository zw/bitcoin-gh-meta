I get the following message on `loadwallet`:\r\n```\r\n\"Wallet file verification failed. Failed to open database path '/home/james/.bitcoin/wallet-name'. Build does not support Berkeley DB database format.\"  code: -18\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose I somehow have to upgrade this old wallet to sqlite, but I'm not sure how. I can't find any documentation on how to do this, and it would be nice if the error message surfaced here would give me a link, because at this point I have no idea what to do but downgrade the software.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nClear instructions on how to upgrade the wallet during this error.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nBitcoin Core version v25.99.0-4a481a1f4d79\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nI didn't see any related logs.\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nBitcoin Core version v25.99.0-4a481a1f4d79\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
