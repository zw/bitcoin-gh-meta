Essentially the node can only estimate how many blocks \"should be\" in the chain given the time. Your node doesn't know if there is a longer chain out there than what it already has, and so \"progress\" is just a guess. \r\n\r\nEdit: hm actually the SE questions don't really cover this. I'll add it there !",
