Essentially the node can only estimate how many blocks \"should be\" in the chain given the time. Your node doesn't know if there is a longer chain out there than what it already has, and so \"progress\" is just a guess. \r\n\r\nEdit: hm actually the SE questions don't really cover this. I'll add it there !",

I agree that something along the lines of what @maflcko is talking about  would be more clear. The \"verification progress\" could be as a function of known headers, and then there could be a field showing elapsed time since the most recent header. \r\n\r\nThe reality is that a node can be fully synchronized, although its work of constantly searching for new headers and blocks is never-ending. So perhaps it would be technically correct to say both it is fully synchronized (100%), and yet it is still \"synchronizing\" at the same time. But if the term can have these dual meanings, it can lead to confusion.",
