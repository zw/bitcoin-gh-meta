They might now be protected from eviction due to network-specific extra peers, but that eviction is also new: Before #27213, we only had the stale-tip eviction, and I think that it would only extremely rarely evict such a peer because of the way it works (see [this post](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28248#issuecomment-1812702510) for why I think so), so once an automatic connections was made, it was probably never evicted unless there were other causes like we got offline or they disconnected us.\r\n\r\nI think that the mechanism mentioned in the OP (race after getting disconnected) is probably what makes this most noticeable, because `ThreadOpenAddedConnections()` has a long sleep (60s) which it wouldn't interrupt, and even though `EXTRA_NETWORK_PEER_INTERVAL = 5min` is larger, it would immediately kick in after the only peer from a network disconnected us (and then the next time ~5 minutes later), so `ThreadOpenConnection` would usually be quicker than `ThreadOpenAddedConnections()`.\r\n\r\nA completely unrelated problem is that this problem exists because cjdns has so few peers <10? on mainnet, which is a shame considering how much engineering effort went into it, but I'm not sure what to do about that.",

When one-click I2P support was added to Raspiblitz and Umbrel in December 2022 after [this workshop and blog post](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/using-alternative-p2p-networks-with-bitcoin-core), the number of recent peers returned by -addrinfo for me went from a couple hundred to quickly more than a thousand, and now a couple thousand.  Cjdns being a friend-of-a-friend topology requires the additional step of finding a friend to connect to the network with, but we have a couple of stable ones in the hardcoded DNS seeds, and maybe I can encourage and work with the node-in-a-box packages to get support for it in (and do more related workshops).",

For example `aaa:8333` and `aaa` and if we are checking if string `aaaa` is equal to either one, the way this is done now is that it would traverse the entire `aaaa` twice whereas it can be done with a single traverse.
