   "body" : "This makes the functional test suite compatible with BIP324, so that \r\n`python3 test_runner.py --v2transport`\r\nshould succeed (currently, 12 tests fail for me on master).\r\nIncludes two commits by TheStack I found in an old discussion https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28331#discussion_r1326714164\r\n\r\nNote that even though all tests should pass, the python `p2p.py` module will do v2 connections only after the merge of #24748, so that for now only connections between two full nodes will actually run v2.\r\nSome of the fixed tests were added with `--v2transport` to the test runner. Though after #24748 we might also want to consider running the entire suite with `--v2transport` in some CI.",
