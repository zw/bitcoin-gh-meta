Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- Experimental support for the v2 transport protocol defined in\n+  [BIP324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki) was added.\n+  It is off by default, but when enabled using `-v2transport` it will be negotiated\n+  on a per-connection basis with other peers that support it too. The existing\n+  v1 transport protocol remains fully supported.\n+\n+- Nodes with multiple reachable networks will actively try to have at least one\n+  outbound connection to each network. This improves individual resistance to\n+  eclipse attacks and network level resistance to partition attacks. Users no\n+  longer need to perform active measures to ensure being connected to multiple\n+  enabled networks. (#27213)\n+\n+Pruning\n+-------\n+\n+- When using assumeutxo with `-prune`, the prune budget may be exceeded if it is set\n+  lower than 1100MB (i.e. `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES * 2`). Prune budget is normally\n+  split evenly across each chainstate, unless the resulting prune budget per chainstate\n+  is beneath `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES` in which case that value will be used. (#27596)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- Setting `-rpcserialversion=0` is deprecated and will be removed in\n+  a future release. It can currently still be used by also adding\n+  the `-deprecatedrpc=serialversion` option. (#28448)\n+\n+- The `hash_serialized_2` value has been removed from `gettxoutsetinfo` since the value it\n+  calculated contained a bug and did not take all data into account. It is superseded by\n+  `hash_serialized_3` which provides the same functionality but serves the correctly calculated hash. (#28685)\n+\n+- New fields `transport_protocol_type` and `session_id` were added to the `getpeerinfo` RPC to indicate\n+  whether the v2 transport protocol is in use, and if so, what the session id is.\n+\n+- A new argument `v2transport` was added to the `addnode` RPC to indicate whether a v2 transaction connection\n+  is to be attempted with the peer.\n+\n+- [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) expressions can now be used in Taproot descriptors for all RPCs working with descriptors. (#27255)\n+\n+- `finalizepsbt` is now able to finalize a PSBT with inputs spending [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/)-compatible Taproot leaves. (#27255)\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- `loadtxoutset` has been added, which allows loading a UTXO snapshot of the format\n+  generated by `dumptxoutset`. Once this snapshot is loaded, its contents will be\n+  deserialized into a second chainstate data structure, which is then used to sync to\n+  the network's tip.\n+\n+  Meanwhile, the original chainstate will complete the initial block download process in\n+  the background, eventually validating up to the block that the snapshot is based upon.\n+\n+  The result is a usable bitcoind instance that is current with the network tip in a\n+  matter of minutes rather than hours. UTXO snapshot are typically obtained via\n+  third-party sources (HTTP, torrent, etc.) which is reasonable since their contents\n+  are always checked by hash.\n+\n+  You can find more information on this process in the `assumeutxo` design\n+  document (<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/assumeutxo.md>).\n+\n+  `getchainstates` has been added to aid in monitoring the assumeutxo sync process.\n+\n+- A new `getprioritisedtransactions` RPC has been added. It returns a map of all fee deltas created by the\n+  user with prioritisetransaction, indexed by txid. The map also indicates whether each transaction is\n+  present in the mempool. (#27501)\n+\n+- A new RPC, `submitpackage`, has been added. It can be used to submit a list of raw hex\n+transactions to the mempool to be evaluated as a package using consensus and mempool policy rules.\n+These policies include package CPFP, allowing a child with high fees to bump a parent below the\n+mempool minimum feerate (but not minimum relay feerate). (#27609)\n+\n+  - Warning: successful submission does not mean the transactions will propagate throughout the\n+    network, as package relay is not supported.\n+\n+  - Not all features are available. The package is limited to a child with all of its\n+    unconfirmed parents, and no parent may spend the output of another parent.  Also, package\n+    RBF is not supported. Refer to doc/policy/packages.md for more details on package policies\n+    and limitations.\n+\n+  - This RPC is experimental. Its interface may change.\n+\n+- A new RPC `getaddrmaninfo` has been added to view the distribution of addresses in the new and tried table of the\n+  node's address manager across different networks(ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p, cjdns). The RPC returns count of addresses\n+  in new and tried table as well as their sum for all networks. (#27511)\n+\n+- A new `importmempool` RPC has been added. It loads a valid `mempool.dat` file and attempts to\n+  add its contents to the mempool. This can be useful to import mempool data from another node\n+  without having to modify the datadir contents and without having to restart the node. (#27460)\n+    - Warning: Importing untrusted files is dangerous, especially if metadata from the file is taken over.\n+    - If you want to apply fee deltas, it is recommended to use the `getprioritisedtransactions` and\n+      `prioritisetransaction` RPCs instead of the `apply_fee_delta_priority` option to avoid\n+      double-prioritising any already-prioritised transactions in the mempool.\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` will now raise an error on startup\n+ if a datadir that is being used contains a bitcoin.conf file that\n+ will be ignored, which can happen when a datadir= line is used in\n+ a bitcoin.conf file. The error message is just a diagnostic intended\n+ to prevent accidental misconfiguration, and it can be disabled to\n+ restore the previous behavior of using the datadir while ignoring\n+ the bitcoin.conf contained in it. (#27302)\n+\n+- Passing an invalid `-debug`, `-debugexclude`, or `-loglevel` logging configuration\n+  option now raises an error, rather than logging an easily missed warning. (#27632)\n+\n+Changes to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+Tools and Utilities\n+-------------------\n+\n+- A new `bitcoinconsensus_verify_script_with_spent_outputs` function is available in libconsensus which optionally accepts the spent outputs of the transaction being verified.\n+- A new `bitcoinconsensus_SCRIPT_FLAGS_VERIFY_TAPROOT` flag is available in libconsensus that will verify scripts with the Taproot spending rules.\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- Wallet loading has changed in this release. Wallets with some corrupted records that could be\n+  previously loaded (with warnings) may no longer load. For example, wallets with corrupted\n+  address book entries may no longer load. If this happens, it is recommended\n+  load the wallet in a previous version of Bitcoin Core and import the data into a new wallet.\n+  Please also report an issue to help improve the software and make wallet loading more robust\n+  in these cases. (#24914)\n+\n+- The `gettransaction`, `listtransactions`, `listsinceblock` RPCs now return\n+  the `abandoned` field for all transactions. Previously, the \"abandoned\" field\n+  was only returned for sent transactions. (#25158)\n+\n+- The `listdescriptors`, `decodepsbt` and similar RPC methods now show `h` rather than apostrophe (`'`) to indicate\n+  hardened derivation. This does not apply when using the `private` parameter, which\n+  matches the marker used when descriptor was generated or imported. Newly created\n+  wallets use `h`. This change makes it easier to handle descriptor strings manually.\n+  E.g. the `importdescriptors` RPC call is easiest to use `h` as the marker: `'[\"desc\": \".../0h/...\"]'`.\n+  With this change `listdescriptors` will use `h`, so you can copy-paste the result,\n+  without having to add escape characters or switch `'` to 'h' manually.\n+  Note that this changes the descriptor checksum.\n+  For legacy wallets the `hdkeypath` field in `getaddressinfo` is unchanged,\n+  nor is the serialization format of wallet dumps. (#26076)\n+\n+- The `getbalances` RPC now returns a `lastprocessedblock` JSON object which contains the wallet's last processed block\n+  hash and height at the time the balances were calculated. This result shouldn't be cached because importing new keys could invalidate it. (#26094)\n+\n+- The `gettransaction` RPC now returns a `lastprocessedblock` JSON object which contains the wallet's last processed block\n+  hash and height at the time the transaction information was generated. (#26094)\n+\n+- The `getwalletinfo` RPC now returns a `lastprocessedblock` JSON object which contains the wallet's last processed block\n+  hash and height at the time the wallet information was generated. (#26094)\n+\n+- Coin selection and transaction building now accounts for unconfirmed low-feerate ancestor transactions. When it is necessary to spend unconfirmed outputs, the wallet will add fees to ensure that the new transaction with its ancestors will achieve a mining score equal to the feerate requested by the user. (#26152)\n+\n+- For RPC methods which accept `options` parameters ((`importmulti`, `listunspent`,\n+  `fundrawtransaction`, `bumpfee`, `send`, `sendall`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`,\n+  `simulaterawtransaction`), it is now possible to pass the options as named\n+  parameters without the need for a nested object. (#26485)\n+\n+This means it is possible make calls like:\n+\n+```sh\n+src/bitcoin-cli -named bumpfee txid fee_rate=100\n+```\n+\n+instead of\n+\n+```sh\n+src/bitcoin-cli -named bumpfee txid options='{\"fee_rate\": 100}'\n+```\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=walletwarningfield` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `createwallet`, `loadwallet`, `restorewallet` and `unloadwallet` RPCs no\n+  longer return the \"warning\" string field. The same information is provided\n+  through the \"warnings\" field added in v25.0, which returns a JSON array of\n+  strings. The \"warning\" string field was deprecated also in v25.0. (#27757)\n+\n+- The `signrawtransactionwithkey`, `signrawtransactionwithwallet`,\n+  `walletprocesspsbt` and `descriptorprocesspsbt` calls now return the more\n+  specific RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER error instead of RPC_MISC_ERROR if their\n+  sighashtype argument is malformed. (#28113)\n+\n+- RPC `walletprocesspsbt`, and `descriptorprocesspsbt` return\n+  object now includes field `hex` (if the transaction\n+  is complete) containing the serialized transaction\n+  suitable for RPC `sendrawtransaction`. (#28414)\n+\n+- It's now possible to use [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) inside Taproot leaves for descriptor wallets. (#27255)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------",

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- Experimental support for the v2 transport protocol defined in\n+  [BIP324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki) was added.\n+  It is off by default, but when enabled using `-v2transport` it will be negotiated\n+  on a per-connection basis with other peers that support it too. The existing\n+  v1 transport protocol remains fully supported.\n+\n+- Nodes with multiple reachable networks will actively try to have at least one\n+  outbound connection to each network. This improves individual resistance to\n+  eclipse attacks and network level resistance to partition attacks. Users no\n+  longer need to perform active measures to ensure being connected to multiple\n+  enabled networks. (#27213)\n+\n+Pruning\n+-------\n+\n+- When using assumeutxo with `-prune`, the prune budget may be exceeded if it is set\n+  lower than 1100MB (i.e. `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES * 2`). Prune budget is normally\n+  split evenly across each chainstate, unless the resulting prune budget per chainstate\n+  is beneath `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES` in which case that value will be used. (#27596)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- Setting `-rpcserialversion=0` is deprecated and will be removed in\n+  a future release. It can currently still be used by also adding\n+  the `-deprecatedrpc=serialversion` option. (#28448)\n+\n+- The `hash_serialized_2` value has been removed from `gettxoutsetinfo` since the value it\n+  calculated contained a bug and did not take all data into account. It is superseded by\n+  `hash_serialized_3` which provides the same functionality but serves the correctly calculated hash. (#28685)\n+\n+- New fields `transport_protocol_type` and `session_id` were added to the `getpeerinfo` RPC to indicate\n+  whether the v2 transport protocol is in use, and if so, what the session id is.\n+\n+- A new argument `v2transport` was added to the `addnode` RPC to indicate whether a v2 transaction connection\n+  is to be attempted with the peer.\n+\n+- [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) expressions can now be used in Taproot descriptors for all RPCs working with descriptors. (#27255)\n+\n+- `finalizepsbt` is now able to finalize a PSBT with inputs spending [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/)-compatible Taproot leaves.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- Experimental support for the v2 transport protocol defined in\n+  [BIP324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki) was added.\n+  It is off by default, but when enabled using `-v2transport` it will be negotiated\n+  on a per-connection basis with other peers that support it too. The existing\n+  v1 transport protocol remains fully supported.\n+\n+- Nodes with multiple reachable networks will actively try to have at least one\n+  outbound connection to each network. This improves individual resistance to\n+  eclipse attacks and network level resistance to partition attacks. Users no\n+  longer need to perform active measures to ensure being connected to multiple\n+  enabled networks. (#27213)\n+\n+Pruning\n+-------\n+\n+- When using assumeutxo with `-prune`, the prune budget may be exceeded if it is set\n+  lower than 1100MB (i.e. `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES * 2`). Prune budget is normally\n+  split evenly across each chainstate, unless the resulting prune budget per chainstate\n+  is beneath `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES` in which case that value will be used. (#27596)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- Setting `-rpcserialversion=0` is deprecated and will be removed in\n+  a future release. It can currently still be used by also adding\n+  the `-deprecatedrpc=serialversion` option. (#28448)\n+\n+- The `hash_serialized_2` value has been removed from `gettxoutsetinfo` since the value it\n+  calculated contained a bug and did not take all data into account. It is superseded by\n+  `hash_serialized_3` which provides the same functionality but serves the correctly calculated hash. (#28685)\n+\n+- New fields `transport_protocol_type` and `session_id` were added to the `getpeerinfo` RPC to indicate\n+  whether the v2 transport protocol is in use, and if so, what the session id is.\n+\n+- A new argument `v2transport` was added to the `addnode` RPC to indicate whether a v2 transaction connection\n+  is to be attempted with the peer.\n+\n+- [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) expressions can now be used in Taproot descriptors for all RPCs working with descriptors. (#27255)\n+\n+- `finalizepsbt` is now able to finalize a PSBT with inputs spending [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/)-compatible Taproot leaves. (#27255)\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- `loadtxoutset` has been added, which allows loading a UTXO snapshot of the format\n+  generated by `dumptxoutset`. Once this snapshot is loaded, its contents will be\n+  deserialized into a second chainstate data structure, which is then used to sync to\n+  the network's tip.\n+\n+  Meanwhile, the original chainstate will complete the initial block download process in\n+  the background, eventually validating up to the block that the snapshot is based upon.\n+\n+  The result is a usable bitcoind instance that is current with the network tip in a\n+  matter of minutes rather than hours. UTXO snapshot are typically obtained via\n+  third-party sources (HTTP, torrent, etc.) which is reasonable since their contents\n+  are always checked by hash.\n+\n+  You can find more information on this process in the `assumeutxo` design\n+  document (<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/assumeutxo.md>).\n+\n+  `getchainstates` has been added to aid in monitoring the assumeutxo sync process.\n+\n+- A new `getprioritisedtransactions` RPC has been added. It returns a map of all fee deltas created by the\n+  user with prioritisetransaction, indexed by txid. The map also indicates whether each transaction is\n+  present in the mempool. (#27501)\n+\n+- A new RPC, `submitpackage`, has been added. It can be used to submit a list of raw hex\n+transactions to the mempool to be evaluated as a package using consensus and mempool policy rules.\n+These policies include package CPFP, allowing a child with high fees to bump a parent below the\n+mempool minimum feerate (but not minimum relay feerate). (#27609)\n+\n+  - Warning: successful submission does not mean the transactions will propagate throughout the\n+    network, as package relay is not supported.\n+\n+  - Not all features are available. The package is limited to a child with all of its\n+    unconfirmed parents, and no parent may spend the output of another parent.  Also, package\n+    RBF is not supported. Refer to doc/policy/packages.md for more details on package policies\n+    and limitations.\n+\n+  - This RPC is experimental. Its interface may change.\n+\n+- A new RPC `getaddrmaninfo` has been added to view the distribution of addresses in the new and tried table of the\n+  node's address manager across different networks(ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p, cjdns). The RPC returns count of addresses\n+  in new and tried table as well as their sum for all networks. (#27511)\n+\n+- A new `importmempool` RPC has been added. It loads a valid `mempool.dat` file and attempts to\n+  add its contents to the mempool. This can be useful to import mempool data from another node\n+  without having to modify the datadir contents and without having to restart the node. (#27460)\n+    - Warning: Importing untrusted files is dangerous, especially if metadata from the file is taken over.\n+    - If you want to apply fee deltas, it is recommended to use the `getprioritisedtransactions` and\n+      `prioritisetransaction` RPCs instead of the `apply_fee_delta_priority` option to avoid\n+      double-prioritising any already-prioritised transactions in the mempool.\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` will now raise an error on startup\n+ if a datadir that is being used contains a bitcoin.conf file that\n+ will be ignored, which can happen when a datadir= line is used in\n+ a bitcoin.conf file. The error message is just a diagnostic intended\n+ to prevent accidental misconfiguration, and it can be disabled to\n+ restore the previous behavior of using the datadir while ignoring\n+ the bitcoin.conf contained in it. (#27302)\n+\n+- Passing an invalid `-debug`, `-debugexclude`, or `-loglevel` logging configuration\n+  option now raises an error, rather than logging an easily missed warning. (#27632)\n+\n+Changes to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+Tools and Utilities\n+-------------------\n+\n+- A new `bitcoinconsensus_verify_script_with_spent_outputs` function is available in libconsensus which optionally accepts the spent outputs of the transaction being verified.\n+- A new `bitcoinconsensus_SCRIPT_FLAGS_VERIFY_TAPROOT` flag is available in libconsensus that will verify scripts with the Taproot spending rules.\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- Wallet loading has changed in this release. Wallets with some corrupted records that could be\n+  previously loaded (with warnings) may no longer load. For example, wallets with corrupted\n+  address book entries may no longer load. If this happens, it is recommended\n+  load the wallet in a previous version of Bitcoin Core and import the data into a new wallet.\n+  Please also report an issue to help improve the software and make wallet loading more robust\n+  in these cases. (#24914)\n+\n+- The `gettransaction`, `listtransactions`, `listsinceblock` RPCs now return\n+  the `abandoned` field for all transactions. Previously, the \"abandoned\" field\n+  was only returned for sent transactions. (#25158)\n+\n+- The `listdescriptors`, `decodepsbt` and similar RPC methods now show `h` rather than apostrophe (`'`) to indicate\n+  hardened derivation. This does not apply when using the `private` parameter, which\n+  matches the marker used when descriptor was generated or imported. Newly created\n+  wallets use `h`. This change makes it easier to handle descriptor strings manually.\n+  E.g. the `importdescriptors` RPC call is easiest to use `h` as the marker: `'[\"desc\": \".../0h/...\"]'`.\n+  With this change `listdescriptors` will use `h`, so you can copy-paste the result,\n+  without having to add escape characters or switch `'` to 'h' manually.\n+  Note that this changes the descriptor checksum.\n+  For legacy wallets the `hdkeypath` field in `getaddressinfo` is unchanged,\n+  nor is the serialization format of wallet dumps. (#26076)\n+\n+- The `getbalances` RPC now returns a `lastprocessedblock` JSON object which contains the wallet's last processed block\n+  hash and height at the time the balances were calculated. This result shouldn't be cached because importing new keys could invalidate it. (#26094)\n+\n+- The `gettransaction` RPC now returns a `lastprocessedblock` JSON object which contains the wallet's last processed block\n+  hash and height at the time the transaction information was generated. (#26094)\n+\n+- The `getwalletinfo` RPC now returns a `lastprocessedblock` JSON object which contains the wallet's last processed block\n+  hash and height at the time the wallet information was generated. (#26094)\n+\n+- Coin selection and transaction building now accounts for unconfirmed low-feerate ancestor transactions. When it is necessary to spend unconfirmed outputs, the wallet will add fees to ensure that the new transaction with its ancestors will achieve a mining score equal to the feerate requested by the user. (#26152)\n+\n+- For RPC methods which accept `options` parameters ((`importmulti`, `listunspent`,\n+  `fundrawtransaction`, `bumpfee`, `send`, `sendall`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`,\n+  `simulaterawtransaction`), it is now possible to pass the options as named\n+  parameters without the need for a nested object. (#26485)\n+\n+This means it is possible make calls like:\n+\n+```sh\n+src/bitcoin-cli -named bumpfee txid fee_rate=100\n+```\n+\n+instead of\n+\n+```sh\n+src/bitcoin-cli -named bumpfee txid options='{\"fee_rate\": 100}'\n+```\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=walletwarningfield` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `createwallet`, `loadwallet`, `restorewallet` and `unloadwallet` RPCs no\n+  longer return the \"warning\" string field. The same information is provided\n+  through the \"warnings\" field added in v25.0, which returns a JSON array of\n+  strings. The \"warning\" string field was deprecated also in v25.0. (#27757)\n+\n+- The `signrawtransactionwithkey`, `signrawtransactionwithwallet`,\n+  `walletprocesspsbt` and `descriptorprocesspsbt` calls now return the more\n+  specific RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER error instead of RPC_MISC_ERROR if their\n+  sighashtype argument is malformed. (#28113)\n+\n+- RPC `walletprocesspsbt`, and `descriptorprocesspsbt` return\n+  object now includes field `hex` (if the transaction\n+  is complete) containing the serialized transaction\n+  suitable for RPC `sendrawtransaction`. (#28414)\n+\n+- It's now possible to use [Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) inside Taproot leaves for descriptor wallets. (#27255)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- The transaction list in the GUI to no longer provide a special category for \"payment to yourself\". Now transactions that have both inputs and outputs that affect the wallet are displayed on separate lines for spending and receiving. (gui#119)",
