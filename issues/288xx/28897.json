Since #27469, birthdates are used to determine whether a block should be scanned. Incorrect birthdates result in the reindex failing to find transactions that already exist in the wallet and subsequently marking them as inactive. While this issue is resolved by reloading the wallet, and rescanning in the worst case, it shouldn't be necessary to do either of those following a reindex.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19808#issuecomment-1814881584",
