What we do save is the service flags , which could be dumped with the debug-only `getrawaddrman` rpc.\r\n\r\nHowever, a BIP324 service flag for an addr in `tried` does not necessarily indicate that we connected to them via v2. The service flag may just be wrong (and we connected to them but downgraded the conection to v1), or maybe it is true now but either we or them did not run with `-v2transport` at the time the connection was made.",
