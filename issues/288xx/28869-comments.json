Maybe there is precedent for something similar but to me it feels more like this is something comparable to `test_utxo_snapshots.sh`? I think the dependencies to the test framework could be removed and then the script could be further parameterized, allowing the stress test to be run on even different numbers with different asmap files, depending on what scenario the tester wants to run. \r\n\r\nI think it could be running as part of suite as well though, invoked with the asmap file fixture that we have there? I guess that also depends on how long the test takes to run.\r\n\r\nSo I am currently unsure if this is more valuable as a devtool or as a functional test. I slightly tend towards devtool at the moment. @virtu do you have some feedback on whether this would be/would have been helpful for you as a tool for your simulations?",

I chose this number to not make the test slower, however, if we migrate this test to `contrib`, we can remove this limitation and use all the distincts ASN from the file).\r\n- Many addresses from the same AS (e.g. 1000) - especially because when adding a new address to an occupied position of a bucket, it will not replace the existing entry, expect for some specific cases.\r\n\r\n",

I have been testing this with the asmap.dat file from https://github.com/fjahr/asmap-data/pull/6 and I noticed that after adding 60-70 entries the program slows down a lot and sometimes takes over a minute to add the next address. Have you seen this as well and do you know why this is @brunoerg ?\r\n\r\nJust checked it, @fjahr. I think `assert_debug_log` is slowing it down. Can you please check with the following diff?\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/contrib/asmap/test_bucketing.py b/contrib/asmap/test_bucketing.py\r\nindex 575ce72ad3..f1033d66bc 100755\r\n--- a/contrib/asmap/test_bucketing.py\r\n+++ b/contrib/asmap/test_bucketing.py\r\n@@ -78,11 +78,10 @@ class AsmapBucketingTest(BitcoinTestFramework):\r\n                     addr_port = f\"{addr}:8333\" if type(ipaddress.ip_address(addr)) is ipaddress.IPv4Address else f\"[{addr}]:8333\"\r\n                     log_msg = f\"Added {addr_port} mapped to AS{asn} to new\"\r\n                     try:\r\n-                        with node.assert_debug_log([log_msg]):\r\n-                            if node.addpeeraddress(address=str(addr), tried=False, port=8333)[\"success\"]:\r\n-                                added = True\r\n-                                self.log.info(f\"added {addr} (ASN {asn}) to the new table\")\r\n-                                asns.append(asn)\r\n+                        if node.addpeeraddress(address=str(addr), tried=False, port=8333)[\"success\"]:\r\n+                            added = True\r\n+                            self.log.info(f\"added {addr} (ASN {asn}) to the new table\")\r\n+                            asns.append(asn)\r\n                     except AssertionError as e:\r\n                         if added:\r\n                             assert f\"{log_msg}[\" in str(e)\r\n@@ -91,12 +90,6 @@ class AsmapBucketingTest(BitcoinTestFramework):\r\n         addrman_info = node.getaddrmaninfo()\r\n         assert_equal(len_entries, addrman_info[\"all_networks\"][\"new\"])\r\n \r\n-        raw_addrman = node.getrawaddrman()\r\n-        self.log.info(\"Check addrman is successfully loaded after restarting\")\r\n-        with node.assert_debug_log([f\"ASMap Health Check: {len_entries} clearnet peers are mapped to {NUM_ASNS} ASNs with 0 peers being unmapped\"]):\r\n-            self.restart_node(0, extra_args=self.args)\r\n-        assert_equal(raw_addrman, node.getrawaddrman())\r\n-\r\n \r\n if __name__ == '__main__':\r\n     AsmapBucketingTest().main()\r\n```",
