I don't think a cheat code is available to sidestep maintenance here.\r\n\r\nIf you only care about not creating leftover tmp files, you can increase the timeout massively. If temp files are still created, it should be reported and treated as a bug and fixed.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should also treat lower timeouts as bugs, because they harm the fuzz engine from making progress, and also block the CI if many of those inputs end up in the git repo.",
