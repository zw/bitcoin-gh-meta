   "body" : "Two changes to improve the libmultiprocess build on aarch64.\r\n\r\nFirst, is to always install libmultiprocess into `lib/`. On some systems (my Fedora aarch64 box), libmultiprocess was being installed into `lib64/`, and then configure would fail to pick it up, because we only add `lib/` to pkgconfig/ldflags out of depends. Rather than adding lib64 to those, I opted for installing libmultiprocess into lib, with every other dependency we build.\r\n\r\nSecond, is to build with position independant code. This matches what we do with all other deps (see `--with-pic`), and ultimately resolves #26943.\r\n\r\nFixes #26943.",
