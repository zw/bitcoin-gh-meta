On some systems (my Fedora aarch64 box), libmultiprocess was being installed into `lib64/`, and then configure would fail to pick it up, because we only add `lib/` to pkgconfig/ldflags out of depends. Rather than adding lib64 to those, I opted for installing libmultiprocess into lib, with every other dependency we build.\r\n\r\nThis was broken in our build after https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/pull/79 upstream.",
