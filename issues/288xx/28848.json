   "body" : "This was prompted by errors being returned that didn't \"make any sense\" to me, because it would for example return a \"fee too low\" error, when the \"real\" error was the child had something invalid, which disallowed CPFP evaluation. Rather than make judgment calls on what error is important(which is currently just return the \"first\"!), we simply return all errors and let the callers determine what's best.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is the best format, in that maybe we want to make failure cases more obvious. Maybe failures into its own top-level object?\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a couple bugs:\r\n\r\n1) Currently we don't actually broadcast a transaction, even if it was entered into our mempool, if a subsequent transaction causes `PKG_TX` failure. (I have a test for another branch that catches this, will adapt if concept ACK)\r\n2) \"other-wtxid\" is uncovered by tests, but IIUC was previously required to return \"fees\" and \"vsize\" results, but did not. I just make those results optional.",
