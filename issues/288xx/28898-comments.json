      "body" : "> the rescan won't find the txs if the birthdate is wrong\r\n\r\nThe birth time check resides on the 'block connected' event handler. It does not affect the `rescanblockchain` functionality. Users can utilize it to identify missing transactions.\r\n\r\n> see also #28897\r\n\r\nFixed it few days ago, see #28920.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, on hardware without parallel cores, building the block filter index is not going to be sped up\r\n\r\nThat's true, but it's not a reason not to do it. The entire node is multi-threaded, and the user will need to call `rescanblockchain` sooner or later to obtain the latest wallet state (use missing tx outputs, see the final balance, etc.)\r\n\r\nI'm not going against your proposed changes (the  `getbalances scan_utxoset=true` sounds good for me). But, just as a clarification; the user will still need to call `rescanblockchain` **after** calling `getbalances` to detect the transaction(s) history and any other possible branches of it.\r\nFor instance, could be a case where the spendable utxo is part of a chain of transactions, so the wallet will need to scan the chain backward. Which could also cause the wallet to surpass the look-ahead window (the 1k key pool), which could make the wallet identify other transactions along the way.",
