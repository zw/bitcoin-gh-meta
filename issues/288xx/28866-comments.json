      "body" : "# V26.0 Testing Guide notes\r\n\r\nHey @m3dwards thanks for taking this on, the guide looks great so far! I didn't practically run through all the tests myself yet, but left a few tiny nits from a read-through below:\r\n\r\n## Compile Release Candidate\r\n\r\n> it is recommended that you compile with sqlite(--with-sqlite=yes), so make sure you have installed the sqlite3 dependency.\r\n\r\ndefault is `--with-sqlite=auto` which will pick up `sqlite3` if it's installed, so this isn't particularly required so long as the dep is installed. If sqlite wallets are needed/used in the guide then it probably still makes sense though, as with it configure should fail if it can't find sqlite3 alerting you in the process instead of silently continuing without it\r\n\r\n## RPC: add getprioritisedtransactions\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- The RPC prioritisetransaction allows you to \"prioritise\" a transaction in the mempool by treating it as if it had a higher fee than it actually does. This new RPC allows you to see which transactions have been prioritised and if they are in your mempool.\r\n+ The RPC prioritisetransaction allows miners to \"prioritise\" a transaction in their mempool for block assembly by treating it as if it had a higher fee than it actually does. This new RPC fetches prioritised transactions from the node's mempool.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Send a transaction to yourself with a 10 sat per vbyte fee\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet send \"{\\\"$ADDRESS\\\": 1}\" null \"unset\" 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust a general comment: it can be easier to use the `-named` flag, so this command (and others) could drop a few unneeded params and become:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet -named send outputs=\"{\\\"$ADDRESS\\\": 1}\" fee_rate=10\r\n```\r\nedit: I see you have used named for some of the other commands, so nvm.\r\n\r\n## RPC: Importmempool\r\n\r\nImport the mempool\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bcli importmempool /tmp/26-rc-test/regtest/mempool.dat.old\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess it's the same in practice, but you've use `/tmp/` here instead of `$DATA_DIR/regtest/mempool.dat.old`\r\n\r\n## V2 Transport - BIP 324\r\n\r\n```diff!\r\n- The `true` at end of the previous command instructs the addnode RPC to us V2 transport.\r\n+ The `true` at end of the previous command instructs the addnode RPC to use V2 transport.\r\n```",

      "body" : "# Feedback and Suggestions for Bitcoin Core 26.0 RC2 Testing Guide\r\n\r\n@m3dwards, many thanks for your great work with this. I've run through all the examples in your guide and found it very easy to follow. Just a few nits from my testing below:\r\n\r\nIn general, I agree with @D33r-Gee that removing the `$` would be helpful. My preference would be for making it as easy as possible to enter the correct input(s) to produce the desired output(s), though I can appreciate the desire to distinguish inputs from outputs.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n```diff\r\n- [macOS zip packaging](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/26.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide#MacOs-zip-packaging) [PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28432)\r\n+ [macOS zip packaging](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/26.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide#MacOs-zip-packaging) ([PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28432))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## RPC: Importmempool\r\nI was able to complete the Regtest testing of `importmempool`, but was unable to complete Mainnet testing. I do have a Mainnet synced node (Bitcoin Core 25.1.0), but it was hard for me to access it from my compiled instance of bitcoin-26.0rc2. Is the expectation that after compiling from source, a full IBD is completed with bitcoin-26.0rc2 and then the Mainnet tests should be run? If so, that was not immediately clear to me. If not, I was unable to figure out a solution, despite trying for some time.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- Restest Test\r\n+ Regtest Test\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mainnet Test\r\n```diff\r\n- Check mempool, we should transactions\r\n+ Check mempool, we should see transactions\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TapMiniscript\r\n```diff\r\n- And check out unspent outputs for the taproot wallet:\r\n+ And check our unspent outputs for the taproot wallet:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks again!",

As there's nothing especial and instructions are already specified on sections \"1. Grab Latest Release Candidate\" and \"2. Compile Release Candidate\". Maybe you can rename it as \"Special considerations when run on Mac OS\" or something similar, in case you want to mention those 2 paragraphs regarding the permissions and the reminder of shutting down the app. \r\n\r\nIn the case that user decides to compile from source it's important to mention (perhaps on \"2. Compile Release Candidate\") that once they clone the repo they would need to checkout the proper version (e.g.: `git checkout -b v26.0rc3 tags/v26.0rc3`).\r\n\r\nOn section:\r\n\r\n### RPC: Importmempool\r\n#### Regtest Test\r\n\r\nPerhaps can be mentioned that the `\"usage\"` field could vary (e.g.: in my case was `1184` instead of `1136`).\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"loaded\": true,\r\n  \"size\": 1,\r\n  \"bytes\": 141,\r\n  \"usage\": 1184,\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn section:\r\n\r\n### TapMiniscript\r\n\r\nSince this is the largest testing section, could be structured with a numbered list? Some snippets look a bit similar.\r\n\r\nOn section:\r\n\r\n### Outbound connection management\r\n\r\nIt could be mentioned that would be visually easier to see the connections using `bitcoin-qt` accessing to the Peers tab on the Node window (main menu->Window->Peers).\r\n\r\nA typo on this section:\r\n\r\n### Add pool based memory resource\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-Run a re-index up to block 690000. Warning: Sepending on hardware this will take a long time, probably hours.\r\n+Run a re-index up to block 690000.
