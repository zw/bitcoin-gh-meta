   "body" : "Rebase of #12138:\r\n\r\n> This adds a `setBlockIndexHeaderCandidates` which mimics `setBlockIndexCandidates` and is\r\nThe set of all leaf `CBlockIndex` entries with` BLOCK_VALID_TREE` (for itself and all ancestors) and\r\nas good as our current tip or better. Entries here are potential future candidates for insertion\r\ninto `setBlockIndexCandidates`, once we get all the required block data. Thus, entries here\r\nrepresent chains on which we should be actively downloading block data.\r\n>\r\n> Note that we define \"as good as our current tip or better\" slightly differently here than in\r\nsetBlockIndexCandidates - we include things which will have a higher nSequence (but have the\r\nsame chain work) here, but do not include such entries in setBlockIndexCandidates. This is\r\nbecause we prefer to also download towards chains which have the same total work as our current\r\nchain (as an optimization since a reorg is very possible in such cases).\r\n>\r\n> Note that, unlike `setBlockIndexCandidates`, we only store \"leaf\" entries here, as we are not as\r\naggressively prune-able (`setBlockIndexCandidates` are things which we can, and usually do, try to connect immediately, and thus entries dont stick around for long). Thus, it may be the case that\r\n`chainActive.Tip()` is NOT in `setBlockIndexHeaderCandidates`.\r\n>\r\n> Additionally, unlike setBlockIndexCandidates, we are happy to store entries which are not\r\nconnectable due to pruning here.\r\n>\r\n> This is useful as it (finally) disconnects net_processing logic from the \"store on disk\" logic in validation.cpp. More importantly, it represents what you'd need from the consensus logic to implement a spv-first sync mode, as this provides a best-header which will follow invalidity - always pointing to the best-possible header even after block(s) are found to be invalid.\r\n\r\nNot included:\r\n* #13912 (test framework change)\r\n* #13930 (source code comment which is useful on its own)\r\n* a9db3dada0119c183d16627805e90c4dbca05c6a \"Do not unlock cs_main in ABC unless we've actually made progress\": already merged as part of #13023\r\n\r\nNoteble rebase changes:\r\n* `pindex_was_in_chain` is still needed due to  #12431, in order to notify the gui about a new block tip, only if the active chain was modified\r\n* `qt/clientmodel.cpp` changed significantly, because things were moved to `interfaces/node.cpp`\r\n* updated `ProcessNewBlock` bench\r\n\r\nI added an additional commit, because the new `!fHasMoreOrSameWork && !parent_of_header_candidate` check in `AcceptBlock` can cause `submitblock` (modified in #13439) to mistakingly believe the block is a duplicate.\r\n\r\nAdded debug log statements to `rpc_preciousblock.py` that helped me figure out the above issue.",
