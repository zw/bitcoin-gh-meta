   "body" : "Currently Article 2: Confederation point II reads:\r\n_President: a publicly identified (real\r\n-\r\nlife identity is known) \r\nBU Member who is responsible for the ongoing activities \r\nof the confederation_\r\n\r\nMaking a person who is known publicly (real life identity is known) puts a target on them. Not from so called online trolls but it allows them to be targets of real life physical violence. Having the \"president of bitcoin\" as a public feature is very dangrous for the person and for the project. \r\n\r\nThe following roles also are in danger of physical harm when known publicly: **Secretary,Developer,Pool Operator**. \r\n\r\nWhy is physical harm or blackmail a real possiblity? The reason is that Bitcoin Unlimited calls for voting. Simply beat the vote out of the person or blackmail them into voting how you want. This can be used by factions in the project, the evil company borgstream or any goverment institution that would like to destroy the project. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\n-\r\nRemove \"a publicly identified (real\r\n-\r\n**life identity is known) \"**\r\nFrom all parts of the Confederation\r\n",
