The `Ã¢ÂÂ¦` button won't recognize them and typing it manually in to the field says gives an error of `Cannot create data directory here` - https://my.mixtape.moe/oguyso.png\r\n\r\n@unsystemizer \r\nWhere does it say that you support drive letter paths? Where does it say you support anything at all? If you want to go down this path, you support Windows and UNC paths have been around in Windows since at least the early 90s - https://www.google.com/patents/US5341499?pg=PA6&dq=%22universal+naming+convention%22\r\nThis isnt some sort of new feature or API, and certainly isnt obscure as it is the standard way of specifying network file systems which is rather common nowadays - just look at roaming profiles as an example.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the fact that it allows me to set one in the first place and correctly reads the amount of free space available implies the UNC support is intended - https://my.mixtape.moe/lhvuzz.png. If UNC is not supported as you claim then it shouldnt even allow me to specify a UNC path, and would be a bug in that regard, as then Bitcoin Core is failing to validate input when it has a specific feature to validate input if you see my reply in this post to @laanwj.\r\n\r\nAnd finally in regards to your qualifier of _\"as long as @achow101's first comment stands\"_, if you were to read my previous comment in this thread and read #10000 the issue of LevelDB with SMB shares seems to be confined to Linux systems. It has so far worked fine as long as you specify a drive letter. And if you look at at the debug.log it seems to be simply using a relative path rather than absolute path for a lock file when a UNC path is specified - ` 2017-03-16 22:15:33 IO error: C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\SERVER_NAME_CENSORED\\NAS\\Application Data\\Bitcoin\\blocks\\index\\LOCK: Could not lock file.` Which seems like it would be an easy bugfix for someone familiar with Bitcoin Core's code base.",

And was inventing in his mind a list of supported features so detailed it could be a RFC, which seemingly doesn't exist. And no, thats not how open source works, thats how amateurs work. There are countless professional open source projects which accept bug reports without trying to use some contorted logic to justify reports not being a bug, or crying to the reporter to fix it themselves. Some people actually take pride in developing functioning software, but it seems as if they're in short supply in this project.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core accepts UNC paths as a data directory, this is a simple fact. And it crashes when attempting to use the UNC path, another fact. Regardless of whether you want to call the lack of proper input validation the bug, or it crashing the bug, it is still a bug, which is another fact. Instead it seems that the egos of some people here are so fragile that they apparently have problems accepting the fact that their code may contain bugs. If you require a safe space away from users reporting bugs, make this repo private.\r\n\r\n@NicolasDorier \r\nI can confirm that a mapped drive works as well, thanks for that info from #10000. Unfortunately I can also confirm that `//` does not work on Windows. There is a screenshot in my previous post.\r\n\r\nAs far as a highly available Bitcoin Core node it is likely already possible, at least on Windows. Just setup bitcoind as a service, and with Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) it is fairly easy to configure a failover service. As far as shared storage though it would require a iSCSI mount (or something else like FibreChannel), but WSFC does not support SMB as shared storage except for the witness node to obtain quorum.",
