   "body" : "Travis has beta support for a new feature called [cron jobs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/). We should hook into this to run our extended functional test suite once per day.\r\n\r\nThis requires two changes: merging the change to .travis.yml in this PR, and then enabling daily builds of the master branch through Travis settings.\r\n\r\nFor an example of a cron build see https://travis-ci.org/jnewbery/bitcoin/builds/213827649. This currently fails because:\r\n- rpcbind_tests.py requires ipv6, which Travis currently doesn't support. I have a workaround for that on the way.\r\n- pruning.py times out. I've now updated the .travis.yml file to exclude running pruning.\r\n\r\nThe granularity for cron jobs is very coarse - currently Travis only allows jobs to be run daily, weekly or monthly. There have been lots of requests for more flexible cron schedules in [this thread](https://github.com/travis-ci/beta-features/issues/1) so Travis may add this as an enhancement at some point.",
