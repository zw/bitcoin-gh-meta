   "body" : "To simplify the interface of the Base32/Base64 encoding functions for raw data, this PR changes them from taking two arguments (pointer and length) to just one Span. Most calls to `EncodeBase64` pass data from `CDataStream` instances, which unfortunately internally work with `char*` pointers rather than `unsigned char*`, but thanks to the recently introduced `MakeUCharSpan` helper, converting them is quite easy.",
