Bitcoin should probably persist something into the wallet letting it know it needs to rescan from block 0, but I'm not familiar enough with the code to do this.",

But `bitcoind -rescan` doesn't work. Strange, no?\r\n\r\n* When running `bitcoind -rescan` the logs even say that it's scanning from the genesis block:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/425473c056424574f73935add3f110fbce770273/src/init.cpp#L1229\r\nwhich to me would indicate, that the intention of rescan is to actually rescan everything.\r\n\r\n* I believe I might have already lost some coins due to bitcoind's behaviour. My usage pattern has been this:\r\n`bitcoin-cli importprivkey $PRIVKEY1 \"\" false`\r\n`bitcoin-cli importprivkey $PRIVKEY2 \"\" false`\r\n...for all dozens of private keys I have..\r\n\r\nand then finally:\r\n\r\n`bitcoind -rescan`\r\n\r\nThe only reason I caught it this time, was because I knew i was missing a sizable amount of coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n>    I don't think it makes sense to assume the user wants to rescan from block 0 on next restarts eg\r\n>    people import keys that are newly generated and don't need rescans at all.\r\n\r\nThose people don't run with `bitcoind -rescan`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
