Here it is:\r\n\r\n    hello,\r\n    I don't have an easy way of building it so I can't really test it but I do have a couple of comments from looking over the code myself.\r\n\r\n    1) I think you need to look at the name of the shortcut created as well, since they have the same name so the testnet autostart shortcut will overwrite the mainnet one, since they are both just named \"bitcoin.lnk\" - perhaps call one \"bitcoin - testnet.lnk\" ?\r\n\r\n    2) I think the code that makes the autostart stuff for linux around line 690 needs the same fix as the one in your patch.\r\n\r\n    Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks like you handled 1) but doesn't 2) need fixing as well? \r\n\r\nThanks!",
