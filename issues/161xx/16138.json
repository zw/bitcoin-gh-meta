   "body" : "The docs at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building/gitian-building-setup-gitian-debian.md instruct to create a `sudoers.d` entry and an `rc.local` script.  This PR brings `gitian-build.py` in line with those instructions.  Without this PR, running `gitian-build.py` from a stock Debian Buster VM fails due to the missing `br0`, and also prompts for sudo permissions frequently due to the missing `sudoers.d` entry.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR (and the existing instructions on which it is based) are suboptimal, as they will clobber an existing `rc.local` if one exists.  I'm open to suggestions on improving this (maybe putting it in `/etc/init.d/` instead?), though I think that if an improvement is made, it should be applied both to the English instructions and the automated script in order to keep them consistent.",
