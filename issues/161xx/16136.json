It makes the code clearer, and simultaneously verifies that such assumptions hold. But only in cases where we're not at risk of hurting the network by dying.\r\n> â¦\r\n\r\n`DCHECK(expression)` works like this:\r\n* If compiled with `-DABORT_ON_FAILED_DCHECK` (set by `--enable-debug`): Evaluate expression and abort if `expression` is falsy.\r\n* If compiled without `-DABORT_ON_FAILED_DCHECK`: Evaluate `expression` and continue execution.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint main(void) {\r\n    DCHECK(IsFoo());\r\n     ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `!IsFoo()` _and_ `-DABORT_ON_FAILED_DCHECK`, then:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    filename.cpp:123: main: DCHECK(IsFoo()) failed.\r\n    Aborted\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise the execution continues.\r\n\r\nResolves #4576.",
