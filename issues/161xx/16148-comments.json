I understand doing these things wouldn't solve every problem, but it seems like they would solve most of the current problems with no downsides and not be too difficult to implement. The second option \"Rerun about-to-time-out jobs from within travis\" seems especially appealing and it looks like there's an existing implementation of it with curl here: https://github.com/plume-lib/trigger-travis#use-in-travisyml\r\n\r\nThe only potential downside I see is that logs from \"Error! Initial build successful, but not enough time remains...\" builds would be discarded, but since successful build logs probably aren't very interesting, this doesn't seem so important.\r\n\r\nI guess in the longer term, it does seem like we are pushing against travis limits and might need to find other solutions.",
