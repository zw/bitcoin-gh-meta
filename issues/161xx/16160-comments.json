You shouldn't be receiving incoming payments as transactions with change outputs. We may want to improve how to deal with this situation (as I agree not listing them at all is bad), but there is only so much that can be done.\r\n\r\nThe second, depending on how you got in this situation, worries me a lot more. If Bitcoin Core was ever giving out change addresses as public payment addresses, we have a serious issue, so I'd like to see a way to reproduce that.",
