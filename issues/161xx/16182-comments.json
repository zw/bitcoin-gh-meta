A lot of the complexity comes from the fact that you're trying to apply a 'from address'. Such a concept doesn't exist in bitcoin. A transaction can have multiple txins, each of which refer to a txout that may have a scriptPubKey that encodes to an address.\r\n> \r\n> Addresses should be seen more as single-use invoice identifiers. Trying to apply a from/to address model doesn't fit with the Bitcoin UTXO model and will only cause you headaches!\r\n\r\n@jnewbery yes, you right about `vin`'s, but this complexity is simplified on user side. I just \"show only first address\" for user. But i can keep multiple addresses for statistic purposes (if i need to check which addresses used often, etc). This is how such concept exists inside the code realisation what uses bitcoin core wallet.\r\n\r\nThe product i do and i'm a part of providing centralised and unified UI for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, allowing to use features of each other, sure.\r\n\r\nP.S. with XMR it fail i know, this is exception. But while we can get list of addresses, who has been involved into transaction, we can display then to user, and display a tx id too.",
