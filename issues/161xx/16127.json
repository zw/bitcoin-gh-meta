   "body" : "In a few cases we need to use `std::mutex` rather than the sync.h primitives. But `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` doesn't include the clang thread safety annotations unless you also use clang's C library, which means you can't indicate when variables should be guarded by `std::mutex` mutexes.\r\n\r\nThis adds an annotated version of `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` to threadsafety.h to fix that, and modifies places where `std::mutex` is used to take advantage of the annotations.\r\n\r\nIt's based on top of #16112, and turns the thread safety comments included there into annotations.\r\n\r\nIt also changes the RAII classes in wallet/wallet.h and rpc/blockchain.cpp to just use the atomic<bool> flag for synchronisation rather than having a mutex that doesn't actually guard anything as well.",
