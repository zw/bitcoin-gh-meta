Perhaps I could use this to pollute your wallet.dat with megabytes of junk transactions?   I suppose I could still do this without this change though.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it should validate up to block 75k or so, there are so few transactions that this shouldn't change the speed much but by then the difficulty starts getting high enough to make mining insane blocks just for disruptive purposes less attractive.\r\n\r\nI like that the stopping points is 120 blocks before the last lock-in, this seems prudent.\r\n\r\nIt might be prudent to rig the RPC/UI to never show anything as confirmed until the client reaches the last checkpoint.  I can imagine an attack where I can somehow trigger a remote node to flush and rebuild its blockchain, and then sneak some crap transactions past it while its between checkpoints. Though I admit the attack there is a bit far out and this really would make bitcoin no more vulnerable to it.\r\n",

This change doesn't make that attack any easier to mount. By far the bottleneck to that attack would be generating bogus blocks with valid proof-of-work, and if you were doing that they'd have only a single coinbase transaction which doesn't have a signature to check in it anyway.\r\n\r\nRE: rigging the RPC/UI to show everything as unconfirmed until initial download is complete: good idea, but as you say this proposed change doesn't affect that.\r\n",

However, maybe we can still have a configuration option \"Verify entire chain\", for paranoid people?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we are going to trust the locked-in chain data in the client anyway, why not do it for each and every block? There is not even a need for storing the complete hash of each block. For example, one could argue that 72-bit security is enough for blocks (would require 10 years to break with the current network power). In that case, store for each block the lower 9-N bytes of the hash, where N is the number of zero bytes at the front implied by its difficulty. The entire current chain would require 617725 bytes, in that case.",

Again, I realize there is little difference with the maintainer just changing the code, so this argument is probably meaningless.\r\n\r\n2) Verification in a separate tool: I like that idea, actually, as it also allows detection of corruption of the database afterwards.\r\n\r\n3) Sure, after downloading it has the entire chain.
