   "body" : "I collapsed several wallet mutexes into two:  one for the keystore, and one for the wallet. That fixes many potential deadlocks due to wallet code acquiring the various locks in different orders.\r\n\r\nAnd I fixed several other potential deadlocks by requiring that code that needs both the cs_main and cs_wallet mutexes acquire them in that order.\r\n\r\nOne somewhat scary semantic change:  Transaction times reported by in the rpc interface and in the GUI are now always the time the transaction was received by this node (and not the average-time-of-the-last-n-blocks-that-the-transaction-ended-up-in).\r\n\r\nHaving transaction times change as they were confirmed was a mistake, in my humble opinion, but the main reason I changed this behavior was so that CWallet::GetTxTime() doesn't require the cs_main lock.\r\n\r\nI'd like to further compartmentalize locking, but that's a task for another day...\r\n",
