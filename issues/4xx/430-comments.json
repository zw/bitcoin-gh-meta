I agree it doesn't belong in util but in rpc.\r\n* Faster Base64 decoder: using inline code vs. using a library is always a controversial issue, but this is simple enough imho to do internally, after some correctness tests. It doesn't follow the coding standards though, btw.\r\n* Optimize generation of hex output on 'getwork' requests: if you're able to write a faster version for converting to Hex, would it be possible to use it as a base for replacing the current HexStr() entirely? I don't think we need several pieces of code doing the same thing.",

Frustrating enough that people testing out the Bitcoin concept might walk away entirely.\r\n\r\nStronger mining is null if we don't have people spending the Bitcoins.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nIf there is a demand for changes particular to pool operators, perhaps we can offer an alternative repo with optimizations for pooled mining? I think the further we go with the Bitcoin core, the more apparent the different needs between these two distinct groups of client-downloaders.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, some pool operators run their own optimized versions of the client. At some point it might be wise to conglomerate their efforts. Keeping a pool client and a standard client will IMHO allow for greater innovation, and less compromise.\r\n\r\nForgive me if this is an optimization that all clients would need in order to be effective, TBH I don't really know what it does...",
