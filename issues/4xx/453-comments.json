However, between the components there are also dependencies. As both wallet and network request and submit information from main, I'd say 2>1 and 3>1. Wallet code also depends on the network, so 2>3. That gives us a total ordering on the locks: first wallet, then network, then main. This implies that you can call net and main functions while having a lock on wallet, and that you can call main while having a lock on network.\r\n\r\nHowever, this also means it is not allowed to call (possibly locking) code in wallet while having a lock on main. That's exactly what I caused by introducing the wallet-dispatch functions in main (IsFromMe, GetTransaction, EraseFromWallets, SyncWithWallets, ...). The best solution, i suppose, would be to modify these callbacks to only happen outside of main-locked code, and only pass identifiers (by value) to them, as passing references to blocks may mean exposing data that needs locking, and can change while being inspected.",
