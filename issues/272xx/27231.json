   "body" : "The logging RPC does not work as intended and as documented in its help when `0` or `none` are passed.\r\n\r\nPer the RPC logging help:\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following are available as category names with special meanings:\r\n  - \"all\",  \"1\" : represent all logging categories.\r\n  - \"none\", \"0\" : even if other logging categories are specified, ignore all of them.\r\n```\r\n    \r\nThe behavior and documentation were added in #11191, but over time and extended refactoring, the behavior no longer works in master and versions 22/23/24 (the last supported versions currently) -- passing `0`/`none` has no effect.  As there was no test coverage, the regressions went uncaught.  In v24, `none` became unrecognized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli logging '[\"none\"]'\r\nerror code: -8\r\nerror message:\r\nunknown logging category none\r\n```\r\n    \r\nDuring the same time period, passing `1` and `all` has been operational and documented. \r\n\r\nSolution: detect `none`/`0` values and add test coverage in any case, and either:\r\n    \r\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if the values are passed, and update the RPC help documentation, or\r\n\r\n- fix the behavior by returning early.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given that `all`/`1` has been operational, and that `none`/`0` has been documented and appears per the code of the original PR to have been operational, it seems preferable for consistency to support `none`/`0` in symmetry with `all`/`1` and as ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nDone by this pull:    \r\n- add missing RPC logging logic and test coverage\r\n- update the `-debug` and `-debugexclude` config options to use the same code for consistency in behavior between them, and for consistency with the logging RPC that provides the same behavior for both `-include` and `-exclude`\r\n- improve the user-facing documentation and examples; can be tested with `./src/bitcoind -h | grep -A12 \"\\-debug=<\\|debugexclude\" && ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging`\r\n\r\nIf it is decided to backport a fix, commit `Fix RPC logging behavior when \"0\" and \"none\" values are passed` could probably suffice.",
