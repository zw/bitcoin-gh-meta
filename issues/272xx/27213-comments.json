      "body" : "We have 3 open questions that we are interested in hearing feedback from reviewers. We have considered many potential interactions and have laid out a couple specific ones along with tradeoffs of different approaches.\r\n\r\n### IBD \r\nThe first is regarding the interactions between this patch & IBD. Peers on privacy network might be slower than clearnet peers (eg. Tor or I2P). Our current proposal does not have any special case logic for disabling the network prioritization during IBD. \r\n\r\nThis could mean that our overall IBD speed is reduced by not having the fastest peers possible. The network peers could also be intermittently disconnected for stalling & get the node into a loop where it, for example, disconnects a Tor peer, connects to an IPV4 peer, re-adds a Tor peer and then keeps repeating. Finally, there could be interactions with the slow peers causing delays in the response time of the faster peers based on the specifics of our IBD logic. One solution is to just disable the network-specific outbound logic during IBD.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a node can get slow peers by random chance anyways. Whether randomly connecting to altnet peers or because a clearnet peer just happens to be slow. If they are slow, but not slow enough to be evicted due to the stalling limit, that will already have a significant impact on the IBD rate. The issues and potential solutions with improving IBD can be seen as tangential to this proposal, and we could favor not adding custom workarounds that serve as a bandaid to mask the root cause. Enabling alternative networks during IBD is already known to slow down the sync dramatically, and we can just add a warning in the documentation to help users become more aware. \r\n\r\n### Peers protected from eviction \r\nThis patch adds eviction protection for special network peers, but it only gets triggered when we have an extra outbound-full-relay peer (aka 9). This occurs when we detect a stale tip or because we added another special network peer. In these situations weâd want to ensure that we have at least one non-protected peer that can be disconnected so the node can return to the steady state of 8 full-relay outbound peers. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we protect 4 peers via `m_chain_sync.m_protect`, which are the first peers that send us headers corresponding to our best chain. This means 4 peers could be protected with this logic, and 3 more peers being protected by their network. If we added support for two more alternative networks, a user activating all networks could run into a problem where they have 9 protected peers in these circumstances, and unable to return to the steady state of 8 full-relay outbound peers. \r\n\r\nSince it would require adding support for at least one more network to run into this issue, we have not addressed it in this patch. There are multiple viable mitigation strategies: One option is to reduce the number of peers we protect with the headers logic (via `m_protect`). Another is to limit the network-specific logic to 2 random networks or such. \r\n\r\n### Network peer protection \r\nA potential concern of this patch is that the logic that protects network peers from eviction could be âover-protectiveâ. For example, keeping a Tor connection only because it is the only Tor connection, not because itâs providing us meaningful data.\r\n\r\nAny concerns around this are completely bounded by the fact that the protection logic is limited to when we have an _extra_ peer, either through stale tip detection or through the new temporary connections for network specific peers. \r\n\r\nHowever, if there is still concern, @ajtowns had an interesting idea to increase our likelihood of adding a 2nd peer from alternate networks. We could update the stale tip logic to choose the network of the extra outbound differently. Right now, the network odds reflect the proportions represented in `AddrMan`. Instead, we could amend the logic to select based on the proportion of networks we are connected to. This would increase our likelihood of connecting to the network, because, for example, youâre more likely to have â I2P peers than â of your addrman be I2P addresses. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the chances of connecting to a privacy network in that context has two benefits: \r\nIt serves the original intention of the stale top logic to be a last-ditch effort against a perceived eclipse attack. Overtaking multiple networks increases the cost of attack, so this is theoretically a more useful attempt than clearnet.\r\nFor this proposed patch, it would mean the node is more likely to add another peer from the alternate network, so the node is more able to replace a âbadâ network peer with hopefully a better one. This would be effective since the stale tip logic tends to run a couple times a day. \r\n\r\nThis could be treated as a separate chunk of work to be evaluated in a follow-up, or it could be incorporated into this PR if reviewers believe it could help mitigate concerns about edge case possibilities.

      "body" : "Concept ACK.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhere on my TODO, thanks for picking it up!\r\n\r\n> The automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nHmm, this is maybe ok. Another approach would be to try to open to e.g. Tor while still having < 8 outbound connections. To counter the issue of staying with < 8 connections and not being able to open to Tor because e.g. the Tor proxy is broken, then we could give up after a few attempts and then fall back to the old way of filling with random (aka IPv4 ;-)) addresses. If we overshoot the 8 connections (like described above), then for some time we will have more, until eviction kicks in. How much time is that exactly? If that is short then it would be sub-optimal to open a IPv4 connection and drop it shortly after in cases where Tor connectivity is working smoothly. If it is long then we have practically increased the limit of 8 which will cause more traffic.\r\n\r\n> In the above, the clearnet networks IPv4 and IPv6 are counted as one network because diversification between these doesn't make sense and is impossible in some network environments.\r\n\r\nWhy it doesn't make sense? I think it is an extra effort to obtain IPv4 addresses if one has IPv6 addresses and the other way around. Why impossible in some network environments? After all you know if you are going to attempt to connect to `5.6.7.8` or `2030:c0fe:...`.\r\n\r\n> Manual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\n> IBD\r\n\r\nI think there is no need to add special logic during IBD (e.g. disable this PR during IBD). Clearnet peers can also be slow and non-clearnet peers may be fast-enough. IBD should be able to handle slow/fast peers already without special hand-holding.\r\n\r\n> Peers protected from eviction\r\n\r\nI think we don't need to worry about this now because even if we treat IPv4 and IPv6 as separate networks and all 4 from `m_protected` are from one network (e.g. IPv4), then we have 4 more slots for IPv6, Tor, I2P, CJDNS. If we implement more networks, maybe by that time we will have increased the default 8 or I would suggest to then start disconnecting from `m_protected`.\r\n\r\n> Network peer protection\r\n> A potential concern of this patch is that the logic that protects network peers from eviction could be âover-protectiveâ. For example, keeping a Tor connection only because it is the only Tor connection, not because itâs providing us meaningful data.\r\n\r\nI don't see it as \"over-protective\". Can we not have some metric of whether a peer is \"providing us a meaningful data\"? I am ok to deal with this in a followup.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, the root problem here is that addrman has many IPv4 addresses and few I2P ones (for example). If it would have equal number of addresses from each network, then this problem would not exist because then picking up a random one would have a 1/5 chance of selecting any network (thus there would not be any bias towards IPv4). Would it be simpler and solve the problem equally well if we only change addrman internally to return an address from any given network with a 1/5 chance? Then no need to change the eviction logic or the `ThreadOpenConnections` logic. And no need to _guarantee_ explicitly in the code that at least one connection exists to each network. It will happen by itself most of the time.",

The chance of not selecting IPv4 in all `8` choices is `p=(4/5)^8`. So, the chance of not selecting IPv4 or not selecting IPv6 is `2*p`. The chance of not selecting IPv4, or IPv6 or Tor or I2P or CJDNS is `5*p`. In other words, the chance of not being connected to at least one network is `5*p`, and thus the chance of being connected to all networks is `1-5*p`, or `16%` (`60%` for 4 nets, `88%` for 3 nets, `99%` for 2 nets and `100%` for 1 net).\r\n\r\nI think this is enough to ditch the idea of random-chance `Select()`.

This way, if we broadcast another tx after e.g. 1 hour the recipient will not be able to conclude that both transactions come from the same origin.\r\n\r\n> In order for that to work, it would be good to have stronger guarantee that we are actually connected to these networks.\r\n\r\nWould not be needed with temporary tx-broadcast connections.",

      "body" : "> Hmm, this is maybe ok. Another approach would be to try to open to e.g. Tor while still having < 8 outbound connections. To counter the issue of staying with < 8 connections and not being able to open to Tor because e.g. the Tor proxy is broken, then we could give up after a few attempts and then fall back to the old way of filling with random (aka IPv4 ;-)) addresses. If we overshoot the 8 connections (like described above), then for some time we will have more, until eviction kicks in. How much time is that exactly? If that is short then it would be sub-optimal to open a IPv4 connection and drop it shortly after in cases where Tor connectivity is working smoothly. If it is long then we have practically increased the limit of 8 which will cause more traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thought about this, of course, because it's the most straightforward approach. However, don't like it as much as the approach here for several reasons:\r\n- it requires introducing an arbitrary waiting time, during which we might have less outbound connections, especially if this would happen for multiple networks at the same time.\r\n- having too few outbound connections is a a potential security risk for the node and slows down important processes such as IBD, the only downsides of having an extra outbound connection is to have a bit of extra traffic, plus temporarily requiring more inbound capacity from the network.\r\n- churning through a few short-lived extra connections has several unrelated benefits, we do it voluntarily anyway (feeler connections), so I'd think it's no big deal.\r\n- the conditions which precluded us from connecting to a network might correct over time (maybe we had a lot of bad addresses in our addrman in the beginning; maybe some technical problem). Just trying a couple of times right after startup, and then giving up wouldn't be ideal in this scenario. \r\n\r\nI guess it boils down to that in general, I think temporarily having more outbound connections than our target is preferable to temporarily having less connections.",

Though maybe there is an extra effort for a potential eclipse attacker to cover both IPv4 and IPv6?\r\n2) IPv4-only network setups exist, I've experienced it more than once that I would be within a network of some organization and could only connect to IPv4 peers, but bitcoind wasn't able to detect that so I'd see regular attempts to make connection to IPv6 peers which all failed immediately.\r\n\r\nSo basically, we saw no clear upsides, and some downsides, and that's why we decided to add it.\r\nBut I'm not insistent on this if people think that there is enough benefit in having connections to both IPv4 and IPv6 peers - it would also make the code cleaner if we didn't have to apply this exception in multiple places.\r\n\r\nIt had nothing to do with the number of 8 protected peers. I'm sure we could find other solutions around that edge case problem, e.g. adding logic to just not try an extra outbound in the first place when we could get into a position where we don't have an unprotected peer to evict, or softening the protection during eviction as vasild suggested.",

If it is long then we have practically increased the limit of 8 which will cause more traffic.\r\n\r\nSince we already have short-lived connections through feelers, rotating extra block relay only connections, and stale tip detection, can you clarify the disadvantage of adding another? Especially since we wouldnât expect this new mechanism to occur frequently, does it seem acceptable or intrinsically different somehow? \r\n\r\n### RE: ipv4 vs ipv6\r\n@vasild: Are you suggesting that treating them as separate networks increases the cost of attack? Does the delta in energy required from the attacker feel meaningful? \r\n\r\n@0xB10C\r\n> I had the feeling that protecting only one IPv4 or IPv6 could, for example, reduce the number of inbound connections IPv6-only nodes get. However, Iâm not sure if thatâs really the case (I need to think about this more).\r\n\r\nHm interesting. \r\nOur current baseline is that we have no protections based on network. \r\nBy introducing network protections, we would expect the number of inbounds for IPV4 and IPV6 to drop compared to the current conditions. \r\nItâs likely that conflating the two networks would impact the distribution between them, but would that be problematic? \r\n\r\n### Future improvements\r\nAgreed these are orthogonal to the current proposal, but are very interesting ideas worth further exploration! \r\n\t- temporary tx broadcast connections\r\n\t- block-relay-only connections per network ",

I changed the function implementation and also invoked from the additional call site in `MaybePickPreferredNetwork`. It seems viable.\r\n\r\nI haven't pushed it here yet because I'm still trying to figure out a slightly cleaner solution. I noticed that we are introducing a lot of functions to `CConnman` that iterate through the networks to check similar-but-slightly-different attributes. `GetReachableEmptyNetworks` already exists, this PR introduces `MaybePickPreferredNetwork`, and now we may also add this function, `SupportsMultipleNetworks`. given that `CConnman` is already quite large & frequently imported, I'm trying to see if there's a way we could consolidate these similar functions together. will report back later this week :) ",

      "body" : "thanks for the review @brunoerg ! latest push incorporated fuzz test & `ThreadOpenConnections` simplification. I'm still working on the other feedback (as explained above). \r\n\r\none question about your suggested patch in the fuzz test: \r\n`const Network net{fuzzed_data_provider.PickValueInArray({Network::NET_IPV4, Network::NET_IPV6, Network::NET_INTERNAL, Network::NET_ONION})};`\r\nis there a reason to select from the subset of networks? in the patch I pushed up, I also added the other ones. I saw that  `ConsumeNetAddr` used the same subset, but I am guessing that's because of other challenges in creating network addresses. just wanted to check to see if there's something I'm missing.\r\n\r\n### IPv4 & IPv6 treatment\r\nContext refresher: the open question is whether IPv4 & IPv6 should be bundled together as âclearnetâ or treated as two separate networks. The current proposal opts for the former.\r\n\r\nAfter chatting this through with @mzumsande, we are still leaning towards bundling into a single clearnet. Here is our understanding & rationale. We are curious to hear more feedback from reviewers, and are open to being persuaded that the alternative approach is beneficial through concrete examples.\r\n* We do not see clear value in treating them separately: from our research, it seems that most cloud providers allow users to expose IPv4 or IPv6 addresses with trivial setup. If users are running a node on a different setup, eg. local, they can also use a VPN to expose the opposite. The amount of effort required to obtain the opposite address generally seems minimal, which means diversifying would not meaningfully increase the cost of attack for a malicious entity.\r\n* The potential downside is clear: by default, bitcoind considers both IPv4 & IPv6 to be reachable. However, both Martin & I have experienced running nodes within a network setup such that only connection attempts to IPv4 nodes were successful. A node in this environment running current master will still have failed IPv6 connection attempts. But the problem (aka frequency of failed attempts) would increase in severity if we added this patch with logic that treated IPv4 & IPv6 separately.\r\n* If we wanted to treat these two networks separately and not worsen the rate of failed connections, we would have to add additional logic to prevent infinite periodic attempts (eg. to IPv6 nodes in the previous example). This additional complexity is viable, but does not feel justified given not having a clear value add of separating the two networks.\r\n* Just to clarify, having too many peers be protected from eviction is not a current concern regardless of the approach selected here.\r\n\r\n@vasild, @0xB10C - thoughts?",

      "body" : "> * The potential downside is clear: by default, bitcoind considers both IPv4 & IPv6 to be reachable. However, both Martin & I have experienced running nodes within a network setup such that only connection attempts to IPv4 nodes were successful. A node in this environment running current master will still have failed IPv6 connection attempts. But the problem (aka frequency of failed attempts) would increase in severity if we added this patch with logic that treated IPv4 & IPv6 separately.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced this is a problem in the first place -- failed connection attempts on networks that don't exist don't seem to impose any significant costs?\r\n\r\nIt seems simpler to me to just treat each network as if it's meaningfully distinct, and try to remain connected to each one if possible. I'm not sure trying to be more clever about that (eg: we want one of ipv4 or ipv6 because those connections are fast; we want new networks like cjdns because otherwise they might be really hard to bootstrap because few outbound connections are made; we want i2p because it's harder to eclipse than tor; etc) actually has much benefit?\r\n\r\nIf we are worried about failed connections for some reason, we could lower the frequency from 1 minute to perhaps 5 minutes. I think the worst case scenario there is when you have all 8 outbounds via one network (ipv4 eg), want to make a connection to another network (eg cjdns), but have all 3 remaining networks (ipv6, tor, i2p) marked as reachable but not actually functioning. Then you've got a 75% chance of `MaybePickPreferredNetwork` wasting your time, and having to wait another interval. That seems to have about a 4x multiplier in the worst case, so you'd only be making the extra net outbound connection perhaps every 20 minutes, instead of every 5 minutes. But for a long-lived node, that's probably not too bad even so. And in the ordinary case where you only perhaps have ipv6 as reachable but not working, it's only a 2x multiplier.",

I couldn't come up with any good names for the combo, but open to suggestions. I think \"full-tx-outbound\" would be the combined name, but it's confusing since `OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY` is the name of the automatic connections. Instead of renaming all of `OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY` to `AUTOMATIC_OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY` or something, I opted for the mouthful of \"full outbound or manual\". ",

I couldn't come up with any good names for the combo, but open to suggestions. I think \"full-tx-outbound\" would be the combined name, but it's confusing since `OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY` is the name of the automatic connections.

Use them just as labels. `std::unordered_map` fits best with that - `std::unordered_map<Network, size_t>` would work even if `NET_*` are changed to be strings!\r\n\r\n> ... protect the array with m_nodes_mutex to keep the values consistent between the relevant data structures tracking node data\r\n\r\nYes, that sounds like a good idea!\r\n\r\n> ... spill liquid on my laptop ...\r\n\r\nOh, good luck recovering! :crossed_fingers: \r\n\r\n> isn't the point to update the values?\r\n\r\nRight, that does not make sense.

I am not objecting pre-collecting and maintaining that number in `CConnman`, just thinking aloud. That looks a bit more tricky and maybe more prone to bugs (like the above). It is also not generic - the \"full outbound or manual\" number is used only in this specific case and unlikely to be used elsewhere in the future. A more generic approach, that could possibly be reused by other code, would be to store the number per connection type and then this specific code would sum the numbers for `OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY` and `MANUAL`, but that's maybe over-engineering at this point?",

A more generic approach, that could possibly be reused by other code, would be to store the number per connection type and then this specific code would sum the numbers for OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY and MANUAL, but that's maybe over-engineering at this point?\r\n\r\nyeah, that's exactly the reasoning / conclusion I drew. it wouldn't be too difficult to adapt this data structure in the future, so I think it makes sense to keep it restricted to our use case for now",

I mean sure, attempting connections is pretty cheap, but still?\r\n\r\ngood question! looks like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1021 introduced support of IPV6. there's some PR convo that indicates it started with defaulting off, but review direction lead to it being on. \r\n\r\nmaybe we could consider a deeper fix that would allow nodes to detect whether IPV6 is actually connectable or not, and enable / disable whether that network is considered reachable. that would impact the behavior of this feature, but could be considered separately and have a wider impact. on master, nodes that are currently unable to connect to IPV6 are still going to be persisting addresses to addrman & attempting connections periodically.

I've recapped the current status of the PR and am curious to hear feedback as to what route seems preferable. \r\n\r\n* the current tip on this PR has 3 review ACKs ([vasild](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#pullrequestreview-1516160146), [mzumsande](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#pullrequestreview-1548029271) with co-author caveat, [ajtowns](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#pullrequestreview-1548859239)) and 1 lightly tested approach ACK ([willcl-ark](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#pullrequestreview-1516531774))\r\n* the outstanding review comments are relatively small & mostly can be addressed in a follow up. I opened #28189 to address reviewer suggestions of style, reverting `m_network_conn_counts` to an array & adding a release note\r\n* there are two review comments relating to outdated commit messages that can't be addressed in a follow up: [1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#discussion_r1254495003), [2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#discussion_r1275142287)\r\n\r\nsince this PR has been open for a while & the remaining suggestions are relatively small, my preference is to continue trying to get enough review here for confidence to merge, then address the open improvements separately. that said, if maintainers or reviewers prefer otherwise, I am happy to incorporate those changes here.
