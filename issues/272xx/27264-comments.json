As best as I can tell, @lightlike's [reason for doing so](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19860#issuecomment-1023522150) seems to be the strongest reason:\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, even if you do trust them, there could still be attacks on an ISP level that would apply to multiple nodes from one group, so I think it makes sense to include them in the diversification as well.\r\n\r\nI think that makes sense to me.  However, it occurred to me that for networks where we have authenticated connections -- I2P, onion, CJDNS(?) -- that this argument would not apply.  Moreover I guess doing any kind of \"netgroup\"-based diversification for these peers doesn't make sense, since for those addresses, our group assignments are arbitrary and there's no relationship between the address and our route?  (If that understanding is correct then that is a separate issue from the improvement here, so could be picked up in another PR.)",
