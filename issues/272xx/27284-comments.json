To track this, I've opened https://github.com/bencherdev/bencher/issues/361.\r\n\r\n@0xB10C I would be more than happy to implement a nanobench JSON output adapter. It is going to take me a couple of weeks or so to get to it though. So you could either:\r\n\r\n1. Use the nanobench output format template to [Bencher Metric Format](https://bencher.dev/docs/explanation/adapters/#-json)\r\n2. Implement the adapter in Bencher and open a PR\r\n3. Wait a few weeks and I'll take care of it ð",
