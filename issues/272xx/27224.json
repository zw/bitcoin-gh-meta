   "body" : "This is cleanup that doesn't change external behavior. Benefits of the cleanup are:\r\n\r\n- Removes awkward `StringMap` intermediate representation for wallet address metadata.\r\n- Simplifies `CWallet`, deals with used address and received request serialization in `walletdb.cpp` instead of higher level wallet code\r\n- Adds test coverage\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change externally observable behavior. Internally, the only change in behavior is that `EraseDestData` deletes rows directly from the database because they are no longer stored in memory. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rebased copy of #18608. For some reason that PR is locked and couldn't be reopened or commented on.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to #27215 with differences described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27215#pullrequestreview-1329028143\r\n",
