These commits were originally authored by @empact and are taken from their parent PR #25152.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing effort to decouple the `ArgsManager` used for command line parsing user-provided arguments from the libbitcoinkernel library (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26177, and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125). The `ArgsManager` is defined in `system.h`.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nNext to providing better code organization, this PR removes some reliance of the tree of libbitcoinkernel header includes on `system.h` (and thus the `ArgsManager` definition) by moving some logging functions out of the `system.*` files.\r\n\r\nFurther commits splitting more functionality out of `system.h` are still in #25152 and will be submitted in separate PRs once this PR has been processed.\r\n",
