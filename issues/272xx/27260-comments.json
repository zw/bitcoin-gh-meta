Deterministically calculated base58 prefixes with the function ```EncodedPrefixesFromBase58Prefix```\r\n\r\n3. This PR now greatly improves the accuracy of error reporting as seen in the updates to 3d0a5c37e9ccedfa4ecfaa48eeeca1ada5b4eec1 where many valid bech32 tests are fed through the base58 section of the `DecodeDestination` function. This line gives a great example of how this PR addresses this from the current\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/79e8247ddb166f9b980f40249b7372a502402a4d/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 Into a much more accurate representaion.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 This follows up even further to the changes made in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27727\r\n\r\n4. A function `ChainTypeToDisplayString(ChainType chain)` has been added to give user facing display names for the various chains a Bitcoin client can attach themselves to. \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/src/util/chaintype.cpp#L11-L23\r\n\r\nAs a note this PR solves a fundamental issue in the current address validation scheme that if a user inputs anything bech32 with the wrong hrp it's immediately treated as base58 even though it is valid bech32.\r\n",
