This works for me on my own wallet, correctly identifying an ordinary double spend I received as dead.\r\n\r\nMaybe a slight concern that the word dead suggests a little too much finality, that and it's valid hex so /dead in my pager is not super useful. :P  Think we could safely use \"conflicted\"? (E.g. is there a reason other than being conflicted that a wallet transaction would end up in this stateÃ¢ÂÂ I can't think of one). I'm not too attached to such a shed painty change in any case.",

      "body" : "Just tried this patch. It worked successfully. Thanks Gavin!\r\n\r\nOriginally I had sixteen 0-conf entries in listtransactions.\r\n\r\nTen of these were tx 92ad92abd8f267c29ed89107f3f7dbb6a299ed72cb5d6b73bee094b96781ca08, which conflicts with the confirmed transaction d72f8aca7159e8a21ae32d8b91ff12196eb9ea7d9f944d3b41b8d47c55d2351d. (This appeared eight times as a send and twice as a receive.) With the patch, it appears exactly eight times as 'conflicted', which is expected.\r\n\r\nFour of them were tx 079b3a614125301114a30c0cae25709e6599e47375b6db57ac0fc86f0d684ed5, which conflicts with the confirmed transaction fa4c47a2c5bb03d82f7307bb011764a4bb471b7bdc0aa258c1c6dedcc22131dd. (This appeared twice as a send and twice as a receive.) With the patch, it appears exactly twice as 'conflicted', which is expected.\r\n\r\n<b>Edit</b> Both of these conflicts were me manually double-spending to increase fees. Neither of them were malleated.\r\n\r\n<b>Edit2</b> Actually I think d72f8aca7159e8a21ae32d8b91ff12196eb9ea7d9f944d3b41b8d47c55d2351d is a malleated version of 92ad92abd8f267c29ed89107f3f7dbb6a299ed72cb5d6b73bee094b96781ca08 -- the reported output addresses and values match exactly. IIRC this was a coinjoin, so probably I signed and submitted it twice.\r\n\r\n<b>Edit3:</b> As noted by Wladimir, getunconfirmedbalance includes the conflicted txes.\r\n<b>end of edits</b>\r\n\r\nThe other two were nonstandard transactions which conflict with each other but not any confirmed transactions. I was able to get these into my wallet by commenting out the fHave check in rpcsendrawtransaction, which I did to enable double spends. These two transactions no longer appear with the patch, which IMO is reasonable.\r\n\r\nEvery other transaction remains the same, and diff shows no change in their listtransactions entry. Again, as expected.\r\n\r\n",
