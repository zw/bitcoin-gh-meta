      "body" : "So, this test isn't tight: there are a small number of signature values for which S doesn't have the high bit set (and so is shorter than the length limit) but is still greater than the order. These could still be mutated under this rule.\r\n\r\nIn discussion with Pieter, he pointed out that the probability of hitting one of these values was less than 1 in 2^127 and that this way avoids exposing the order of the curve to script.cpp.  Certainly the test is much easier implemented this way... which may be attractive if it is ever to become a network rule (in order to actually kill malleability).  But then again, not being tight is kinda ugly.\r\n\r\nI could argue either way for this, but I think this particular issue deserves a bit of consideration.\r\n\r\n",
