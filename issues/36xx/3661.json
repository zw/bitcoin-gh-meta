   "body" : "First: txnmall.sh is the start of an integration test for wallet handling of\nmutated (malleable) transaction handling.\n\nSecond is a one-line change to IsConfirmed that adds a condition when\nconsidering change outputs : only consider them confirmed if they are\nin the memory pool (inspired by a comment sipa made yesterday).\n\nThis makes getbalance, getbalance '*', and listunspent all agree when run on the txnmall.sh test wallets. Before this fix, those three would return three different results.\n\nBefore:\n listunspent: one 49BTC output\n getbalance: 96 BTC (change counted twice)\n getbalance '*': 46 BTC (spends counted twice)\n\nAfter: all agree, 49 BTC available to spend.\n",
