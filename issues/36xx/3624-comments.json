Not much room for anything like signal processing.\r\n- To make sure they have the same chances of success every miner must be working on the same puzzle: this means that most of the computations will still be wasted. Systems such as folding-at-home distribute different work to different nodes.\r\n- Algorithms cannot use large amounts of data because it all needs to end up in the block chain (cannot require 3rd party data sources for verification). This pretty much rules out the current purposes of distributed computing: crunching through lots of data to find needles in a haystack.\r\n\r\nDistributed computing grids are an interesting subject matter, but irreconcilable with proof of work for a distributed cryptocurrency.\r\n",

      "body" : "1) I figured the module (or protocol) would have a way for other nodes to verify the result, the same as the native PoW does. There could be a peer review process for modules before getting accepted to a modules subfolder within the Bitcoin project tree and enabled with ./configure --enable-modX during compile time. Could modules be signed?\r\n\r\n2) Could there be a way for the network to identify a malicious module and force it to be rejected from the network, similar to how a firewall can inspect and drop/reject packets? Maybe using a combo of digital signatures/hashing? How would the network respond today to a rogue block being injected into a getblocks response? Going back to my context switching analogy, would there be a way to enforce min/max time spent on a module PoW or have other nodes confirm the time spent? Or, how about having the \"global difficultly\" be used to scale the complexity of the module processing.\r\n\r\n3)  I was thinking the PoW algorithm and verification function could be defined dynamically (attached to the block? gotten with another call like getXblocks? or getpow4block?). Then other nodes would rely on a module interface to run/verify (and identify legit/rogue modules). I don't see how this would impact performance at all, since it works the same way as it does today - run this PoW and broadcast the solution for verification.\r\n\r\n4) What are we defining success as? Solving the PoW so the block can be verified by other nodes and added to the chain? Are things really fair at present? Mining with my CPU vs the next guy with his ASIC is not very \"fair\" either, nor is it fair that the SHA256 market is now dominated by rich people who can afford $30k+ miners. If I choose to process a PoW that is harder than the native PoW, is it really a problem for the stability/operation of the network, or is it only a problem if I want an equal opportunity at mining my reward? Some people might be fine with spending 10% more time on a given PoW if it's benefiting a cause they believe in. Could be this reward is worth more to this miner than minting a Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n5) Agreed, I haven't been thinking the data would be stored outside of the block/blockchain. There has to be a way. I keep thinking how Amazon started out as a B2C shopping cart and ended up exploding into a hosting company because they saw the underlying technology used to scale and compute their algorithms was a game changer, or how Google came up with map/reduce because they noticed patterns in data processing and realized they needed a dynamic way of expressing formula's needed to produce some result with dissimilar, complex problems. I'm looking at the underlying Bitcoin technology in much the same way. Sure it's facilitating a cryptocurrency system at present, but it has the ability to do/be so much more.\r\n\r\nThere has to be a way to tap into the mind boggling amount of crunching power the network has. I'm going to go do some more reading on the internals of the protocol and come back for more hole punching if you guys are open to discussing it further. ",
