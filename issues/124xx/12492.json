   "body" : "v0.15.1\r\n\r\nOn fully up to date Fedora 27 the thread (using `iotop`) `bitcoin-qt [bitcoin-msghand]` consumes far too many io's making the system slow to respond and nearly unusable as even typing is affected and the cursor frequently locks. This was not observed to cause any issues on Fedora 23.\r\n\r\nAfter starting `bitcoin-qt` and when loading is complete (after the splashscreen disappears [Issue# 12355](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12355)) the thread io's sits near 99% for`bitcoin-qt [bitcoin-msghand]` for an extended period, until all outgoing connections are made or, until the blockchain is synced, I have not isolated which. During blockchain synchronization, I often only have a few outgoing connections but have a big list of `addnode=` in my conf file. When I come back later the required number of outgoing connections have been made, the blockchain is synced up to date and, the io's have dropped to a normal level and, the system is usable normally.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-qt [bitcoin-msghand]` io's should not cause significant usability issues.",
