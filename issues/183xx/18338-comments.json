Or harder than an alternate solution? \r\n\r\nThis should clearly not be harder to reason about than the status quo. The status quo uses a combination of raw pointers and shared pointers and has a use-after-free bug as a result. Dropping raw pointers and using shared pointers consistently fixes the bug in the simplest way and makes it obvious and automatic that the pointer is only deleted when the last reference is deleted.\r\n\r\nThis approach is also not harder to reason about than the alternate approaches I've seen which have been to make the Unregister function blocking instead of nonblocking. Three PRs #18280 #18279 #18354 have tried that approach and encountered many bugs along the way. The approach is bad because you can no longer rely on reference counting to free the pointer after the last use, and instead have to manually think through every unload sequence and ensure that the new blocking behavior doesn't lead to deadlocks and invalid pointer accesses. It's also difficult because it changes the scheduler code in an invasive way compared to this PR which is just swapping out pointer type for another.",

I think I'd:\r\n\r\n- Move log print and flush out of ReleaseWallet into CWallet destructor\r\n- Rename ReleaseWallet to DeleteWallet since only thing it's doing is deleting the wallet pointer\r\n- Move handler.reset and NotifyUnload calls to new CWallet::Unload method, and call that method from RemoveWallet, so GUI is notified as early as possible and CWallet data members aren't being accessed from outside functions\r\n- Rename UnloadWallet to WaitForDeleteWallet since all it will be doing at that point is resetting the pointer and waiting for the gui and validation interfaces to let go their wallet references",

The point of declaring this virtual is to prevent memory leaks and incomplete destruction in case this is subclassed (whether intended or not). From https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/virtual-functions#virtual-dtors:\r\n\r\n> Hereâs a simplified rule of thumb that usually protects you and usually doesnât cost you anything: make your destructor virtual if your class has any virtual functions. \r\n\r\nThis is an important rule to follow here and other places. Other alternatives would be to declare the class final or give it a protected nonvirtual destructor, but these are optimizations that are more fragile. Just having a virtual destructor when there are virtual functions is usually the simplest safe approach.",

Without the override keyword somebody could make a change to the base class removing `virtual` and unknowingly cause memory leaks in the derived class. But with the override keyword, the compiler will show a \"does not override\" error building the derived class and not allow this.",

You might need an explicitly defined destructor for other reasons, but thereâs _no need_ to redeclare a destructor simply to make sure it is `virtual`. No matter whether you declare it with the `virtual` keyword, declare it without the `virtual` keyword, or donât declare it at all, itâs _still_ `virtual`.\r\n> \r\n> ?\r\n\r\nNone of that is applicable here. NotificationsProxy base class is CValidationInterface which does not have a virtual destructor. If it did have a virtual destructor, this could be declared with `override` instead of `virtual`, and registration would no longer require shared pointers with custom deleters. But these changes would increase size of the bugfix and are better saved for a followup PR. This PR is just trying to do the simple thing and\r\n\r\n- Declare virtual destructors where there are virtual functions\r\n- Use `override` instead of `virtual` where it prevents derived class code from being silently broken by future changes to the base class",
