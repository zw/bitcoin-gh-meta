This makes the service listen on the Whonix internal interface and does not affect security. Restart bitcoind to apply changes.\r\n\r\nYou will also have to open the port on the Whonix-Workstation firewall.\r\n```\r\n$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/whonix_firewall.d\r\n$ echo \"EXTERNAL_OPEN_PORTS+=\" 8334 \" | tee -a /usr/local/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf`\r\n$ sudo whonix_firewall\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo view onion-grater logs, you need to enable debug mode on the Whonix-Gateway:\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"[Service]\r\n## Clear onion-grater default file '/lib/systemd/system/onion-grater.service'.\r\nExecStart=\r\n## Enable debug mode.\r\nExecStart=/usr/lib/onion-grater --listen-interface eth1 --debug\r\n\" | tee /usr/lib/systemd/system/onion-grater.service.d/50_user.conf\r\n$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload\r\n$ sudo systemctl restart onion-grater\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThen after adding the profile, enabling onion-grater debug mode, restarting onion-grater and bitcoind, test if the address is reachable externally. Use the bitcoid option `connect=address.onion`, so you are sure it is connecting.\r\n\r\nIf it is, restart onion-grater.\r\n```\r\n$ sudo systemctl restart onion-grater\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the bitcoin debug.logs, you should see the same error I saw above about removing onion address and not able to authenticate to the controller.\r\n\r\nBut that is not entirely correct, because I can issue an ADD_ONION manually and it will accept, but bitcoind does not try to issue ADD_ONION a second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:54044 (filter: 30_autogenerated): -> PROTOCOLINFO 1\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:54044 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- 250-PROTOCOLINFO 1\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:54044 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- 250-AUTH METHODS=NULL\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:54044 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- 250-VERSION Tor=\"0.4.7.10\"\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:54044 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- 250 OK\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:54044 (filter: 30_autogenerated): -> AUTHENTICATE\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:54044 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- 250 OK\r\n```\r\nThe controller actually lets bitcoind authenticate, as seen from the onion-grater logs above. But I don't understand why bitcoind says it can't authenticate.\r\nThe ip doesn't matter, it is internal ip.\r\n\r\nWhat you should expect from onion-grater logs is the following:\r\n```\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated): -> AUTHENTICATE\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- 250 OK\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated): -> ADD_ONION NEW:ED25519-V3 Port=8333,0.0.0.0:8334\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated): rewrote command:\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]:     ADD_ONION NEW:ED25519-V3 Port=8333,0.0.0.0:8334\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: to:\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]:     ADD_ONION NEW:ED25519-V3 Port=8333,10.137.0.31:8334 Flags=DiscardPK\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- (multi-line)\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]:     250-ServiceID=myonionhostnamewithoutonion\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]:     250 OK\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated): -> QUIT\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated): <- 250 closing connection\r\nhost onion-grater[149562]: 10.137.0.31:43566 (filter: 30_autogenerated) disconnected: client quit\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could try on Whonix with `tor-ctrl` to authenticate after restarting onion-grater and it will work:\r\n```\r\n$ tor-ctrl ADD_ONION NEW:ED25519-V3 Port=8333,0.0.0.0:8334\r\n```\r\nand it will authenticate.\r\n\r\nBut for some unknown reason bitcoind does not reauthenticate to the controller.\r\n\r\nI understand that once the contoller connection closes, the commands send to the controller are not valid anymore. But bitcoind should be able to reauthenticate once it loses connection.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nSystem information was already described above.\r\nI understand this may be difficult debug because it requires a system with onion-grater.\r\nBut it does not rely on Whonix or Tails or onion-grater package to fix this, as they are only restarting to read the new configuration, but bitcoind understand that as a connection that must be closed forever.\r\n\r\nIf you read all this and is open to make bitcoind retry to authenticate cleanly, I am open to help debug and instruct how to reproduce.",
