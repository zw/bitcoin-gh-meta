Opening this as a draft for the minute, to point to from another PR.\r\n\r\nUltimately the goal here (aside from common quite possibly being a better home for this code) is to move the Boost Signals2 using code out of libbitcoin_util, which is used by the kernel.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, we can drop `$(BOOST_CPPFLAGS)` from libbitcoin_util.",
