   "body" : "This PR rewrites a portion of `test_framework/key.py`, in a compatible way, by introducing classes that encapsulate field element and group element logic, in an attempt to be more readable and reusable.\r\n\r\nTo maximize readability, the group element logic does not use Jacobian coordinates. Instead, group elements just store (affine) X and Y coordinates directly. To compensate for the performance loss this causes, field elements are represented as fractions. This undoes most, but not all, of the performance loss, and there is a few % slowdown (as measured in `feature_taproot.py`, which heavily uses this).\r\n\r\nThe upside is that the implementation for group laws (point doubling, addition, subtraction, ...) is very close to the mathematical description of elliptic curves, and this extends to potential future extensions (e.g. ElligatorSwift as needed by #27479).",
