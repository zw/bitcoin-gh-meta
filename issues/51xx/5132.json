   "body" : "This patch extends the Python test framework with the ability to split and re-join the network \"at will\".  It uses this to extend the test for `getchaintips` (but the capability may be useful for other tests as well, e. g., reorg handling).\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a problem with `run_test` provided by `BitcoinTestFramework` (which is never used anywhere, though) and adds the nodes as member to the class (which seems like a good idea to me, but I can revert that change if that's not desired).\r\n\r\nThe second commit works around #5113.",
