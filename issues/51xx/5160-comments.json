      "body" : "I tend to agree with @sipa here.  In my opinion, the following cases should hold:\r\n\r\n- There should ideally be an individual `network consensus key` that is only ever used for consensus related updates and is something all full nodes would find important and therefore would recognize the public key and display.  This would be for alerts like \"Starting with block height 400000, new consensus rules as outlined by BIPxxxx will be enforced.  Ensure your client has support...\".  The `version` fields in this alert message would refer to the protocol version.\r\n- Each full node has their own `individual alert key` which they can use for important alerts which only affect that specific client and hence other clients won't have the public key nor display.  E.g. \"This version of {Bitcoin Core/btcd/Obelisk/Toshi/etc} has a critical issue.  Update to version {x.y.z}.\".  The `version` fields in this type of alert message would refer to the client version of the full node in question.  Since other full nodes would be ignoring these for the purposes of display, the version doesn't affect them.\r\n- Alert message relay handling in general would have \"special privileges\" to alerts signed with the `network consensus key` and the particular client's `individual alert key`.  By special privileges, I mean lack of rate limiting, priority, etc.\r\n- Any alert messages signed by an unrecognized key are subject to rate limiting.  This allows messages from other full nodes, or even newer versions of the current Bitcoin Core key should it become compromised, to be passed throughout the network while simultaneously limiting abuse.\r\n\r\nPitfalls:\r\n\r\n* This would mean it's possible to try and flood out valid alerts with invalid ones, but eventually the valid alert will make it through and that is better than what exists today\r\n* It would theoretically be possible for random, validly signed, messages to be used for 'communication' as pointed out by @BitcoinPullTesterHuman , which obviously isn't the intention.  A simple proof-of-work scheme could be used if this is truly a concern.  For example, the message concatenated with the current reserved field must hash to a value less than X.  This could make creating a signed alert that can be relayed simply for the purposes of idle chit-chat too costly to bother while still working as intended for legitimate uses.  A sophisticated attacker with a lot of hash power could certainly still manage to pull this off, but there is no apparent incentive to doing so at that point.",

An attacker wishing to flood the network can pre-compute thousands of fake alerts and push them to the network at any time. Any level of PoW significant enough to prevent this would stop the intended use of the alert system altogether, if there was a BIP50 situation the current holders of the Bitcoin Core alert key would have needed to grind for hours in order to send a message. This would lead to massive, relatively cheap denial of service and render the alert system totally useless at the same time. It's essentially the exact problem that hashcash had with email minting. The \"bad\" guys usually have access to a lot more hashpower than the \"good\" guys, just by virtue of a lack of morality. \r\n\r\n> Any alert messages signed by an unrecognized key are subject to rate limiting.

If there is a security situation which an attacker can benefit, they can just flood irrelevant alerts to cover up the fact that there's a real emergency going on. Once the rate limit is saturated there's nothing the real message can do in order to get through, so there's definitely a a financial incentive there.\r\n",
