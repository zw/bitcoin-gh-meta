I read the phrase \"bitcoins sent to them\" as making it sound like there's a \"bitcoin\" which can move from address to address. I don't think it helps much, but I was attempting to use \"bitcoin\" as portion/plural rather than \"bitcoins\" which to me implies a number of individual units. \r\n\r\nIn hindsight it's probably a worthless distinction, there's misinformation in a lot more prominent places than this.
