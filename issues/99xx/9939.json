   "body" : "This PR tries to improve the performance of the `listunspent` RPC call by improving `CWallet::AvailableCoins()` iteration through the wallet transactions.\r\n\r\nE.g. If a given address is an outpoint of N transactions, I guess there's no point to check N times if the address `IsMine()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR deprecates #7823 although it's a different approach. In that PR, caching accurately those values was a little tricky because of all the scenarios that could make the cache invalidated (conflicts, double-spends, reorganizations, abandoned transactions, etc, ...).\r\n\r\nStill, with this approach I got performance gains up to 90% on `CWallet::AvailableCoins()` for large wallets.",
