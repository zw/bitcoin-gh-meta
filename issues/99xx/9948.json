   "body" : "I have a very interesting idea for the future, which should be implemented. \r\nI propose to partially rewrite the wallet to another, the language used by browsers. \r\nWhy this is important. \r\nYou all know that web sites are evolving such languages as html, css, javascript will be better and better. \r\nIf we rewrite the bitcoin wallet on this language, we can create a truly beautiful design. \r\nThere will be charts and indicators, and the load on the network wallet will be like a giant site with indicators. \r\n\r\nIf the idea of p2pool is implemented , there will be more indicators of the pool and the capacity of the network. \r\nIs that money going long because of the load on the network, you can specify its transaction priority, and the amount. \r\nThen miners will switch automatically to these addresses may take a long time and will go to a bonus from a user specified priority. \r\nWhat it will give. \r\n\r\nSometimes people need money urgently and the translation should be as quick, and as he is willing to donate some money, this priority will allow you to process transactions with maximum speed, allowing the miner to earn more. \r\n\r\nThat you would understand what I mean, look at the editor https://atom.io/ he's got the same design on almost all operating systems. \r\nThere is also the function of the plugins, very cool idea and bitcoin, if you need the indicator, put the plugin, if you need p2pool inside of the wallet, put the plug-in. \r\n\r\nCats will not be crammed with all and Sundry that nobody needs, each user decides what he needs and install what he wants.\r\n\r\nSory for translation.",
