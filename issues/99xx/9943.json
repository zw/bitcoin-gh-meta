   "body" : "This PR is part of a larger effort to make the test_framework API more intuitive. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9876 for background.\r\n\r\nSeveral testcases use a wildcard import from test_framework.script. That's not ideal as it pollutes the namespace with all of the names defined in test_framework.script, including anything that script.py has imported itself.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `__all__` module variable to script.py which indexes all of the names that should commonly be required by individual test cases. That makes the wildcard import a well-defined API and test cases can wildcard import without worrying about importing unexpected names. If a test case needs to import something from script.py which isn't included in `__all__`, it can explicitly import it.\r\n\r\nI've not included `hash160()` or `CScriptOp()` in `__all__` because `hash160()` is a helper function which I think should be defined elsewhere (ideally in the same module as `sha256()`, `ripemd160()` and `hash256()`), and `CScriptOp` should not commonly be required by testcases (the only place it's currently used is in `GetP2PKHScript()` in p2p-segwit.py, which arguably should be pulled up into the script.py module).",
