Lcov certainly provides a more exact notion of what is tested, but it takes a bit more work to tease out which RPC functions are untested; the simple binary coverage provided in #6804 answers that question immediately and unambiguously, despite being primitive.\r\n\r\n#6804 may also make it easier to gate builds down the road based on RPC coverage -- if the list of untested RPC functions calculated is non-empty, we fail. I think this would be nice to do once we have tests in place for each RPC function, It's not immediately apparent to me how we'd do this with just lcov.\r\n\r\nSo again, I think both are valuable and compatible.

At some point it probably becomes less useful, if a binary outcome doesn't provide further insight (e.g. once all RPCs are rudimentary covered).\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli: this is an interesting idea. Some time ago I actually tried to combine `make cov` and `cpp-coveralls`, but I kinda failed, and unfortunally didn't dig deeper.\r\n\r\nOn a slightly related note: it looks like coveralls is run two times in your repo (Linux+clang, Linux+gcc), and if this is an issue for you, you may look into a [custom script deployment](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/script/), which supports expressive [conditionals](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/#Conditional-Releases-with-on%3A) (I used it to [deploy docs](https://github.com/dexX7/java-libbitcoinconsensus/blob/master/.travis.yml#L43-L49)).\r\n\r\nOne question that arrises is about the extra build time, if coverage data were gathered via Travis + Coveralls. I haven't timed it, but I have the impressionen it takes significantly longer to go though the process, so this would be something to consider. I'd like, if it were nicely integrated though.",
