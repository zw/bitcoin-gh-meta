I use symlinks to put the blocks on a different drive than the rest of the bitcoin files (C:\\Users\\PRabahy\\AppData\\Roaming -> F:\\Bitcoin and F:\\Bitcoin\\blocks -> E:\\Bitcoin_blocks). I sometimes run Armory on the machine that runs Bitcoin-qt. I always run Bitcoin-qt with the wallet disabled.
