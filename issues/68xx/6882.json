   "body" : "I have been trying to run bitcoin node on my raspberry pi 2, but not with much success.\nMy bitcoind seems to crash.\n\n```\n*** Error in `/home/pi/bin/bitcoind': malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted:   0x6c722290 ***\n```\n\nI am not really sure what is the issue, but I have decided to recompile Bitcoin Core anyway.\nThis time I noticed that there were several warnings when making LevelDB and in util_tests.cpp. What can I do to fix this warning? Looking at the source, I couldn't identify why compiler is complaining. Any help would be appreciated. Full log is available upon the request.\n\n```\nIn file included from ./util/arena.h:9:0,\n                 from ./db/skiplist.h:33,\n                 from ./db/memtable.h:11,\n                 from db/memtable.cc:5:\ndb/memtable.cc: In member function Ã¢ÂÂvoid leveldb::MemTable::Add(leveldb::Sequenc                                                                                                 eNumber, leveldb::ValueType, const leveldb::Slice&, const leveldb::Slice&)Ã¢ÂÂ:\ndb/memtable.cc:104:31: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer e                                                                                                 xpressions [-Wsign-compare]\n   assert((p + val_size) - buf == encoded_len);\n\ntable/filter_block.cc: In member function Ã¢ÂÂbool leveldb::FilterBlockReader::KeyM                                                                                                 ayMatch(uint64_t, const leveldb::Slice&)Ã¢ÂÂ:\ntable/filter_block.cc:100:33: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned in                                                                                                 teger expressions [-Wsign-compare]\n     if (start <= limit && limit <= (offset_ - data_)) {\n\nutil/bloom.cc: In member function Ã¢ÂÂvirtual void leveldb::{anonymous}::BloomFilte                                                                                                 rPolicy::CreateFilter(const leveldb::Slice*, int, std::string*) constÃ¢ÂÂ:\nutil/bloom.cc:50:26: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer exp                                                                                                 ressions [-Wsign-compare]\n     for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\nutil/logging.cc: In function Ã¢ÂÂbool leveldb::ConsumeDecimalNumber(leveldb::Slice*                                                                                                 , uint64_t*)Ã¢ÂÂ:\nutil/logging.cc:58:40: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer e                                                                                                 xpressions [-Wsign-compare]\n           (v == kMaxUint64/10 && delta > kMaxUint64%10)) {\n\ntest/util_tests.cpp:322:5: warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO C90\n     BOOST_CHECK(ParseInt32(\"-2147483648\", &n) && n == -2147483648);\n     ^\nIn file included from /usr/include/boost/test/unit_test.hpp:19:0,\n                 from test/util_tests.cpp:18:\ntest/util_tests.cpp: In member function Ã¢ÂÂvoid util_tests::test_ParseInt32::test_method()Ã¢ÂÂ:\ntest/util_tests.cpp:322:52: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]\n     BOOST_CHECK(ParseInt32(\"-2147483648\", &n) && n == -2147483648);\n                                                    ^\n```\n",
