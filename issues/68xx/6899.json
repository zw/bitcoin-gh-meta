Details:\r\n\r\n* -Wno-self-assign is no longer a valid warning to disable\r\n* All the stuff in leveldb is cases of comparison between signed and unsigned\r\n* The change in rpcserver.cpp is an error with gcc 5.2, apparently older versions can do an automatic conversion here but in C++11 mode it needs an explicit conversion to shared_ptr.\r\n\r\nThere are other warnings due to a few uses of std::auto_ptr which is deprecated.  When we switch to compiling in C++11 mode by default, we'll have to convert these to std::unique_ptr, but this is a non-backwards compatible change so can't be done now.",
