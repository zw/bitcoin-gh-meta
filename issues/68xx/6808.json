   "body" : "I run some wallet-less listening nodes behind Tor, for fuzzies and occasional somewhat-private TX submission.  In this setup, minimising load on exits seems more important than having clearnet peers, so I use `onlynet=tor`.  To minimise room for leaks their network configuration also makes Tor their only window to the world.  They do get inbound connections through their onion services.  For reasons probably not relevant, they may be atypically peer-starved at times.\r\n\r\nI see outbound connections to the seeds via exits:\r\n\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX Bitcoin version v0.11.0.0-(the 0.11.0 tag from Github)\r\n        (omit OpenSSL, directories)\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX Using at most 125 connections (1024 file descriptors available)\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX Using 0 threads for script verification\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX scheduler thread start\r\n        (omit RPC)\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX Bound to X.X.X.X:8333\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX AddLocal(XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion:8333,4)\r\n        (omit cache config, LevelDB lines)\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX No wallet support compiled in!\r\n        (omit best chain)\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX init message: Loading addresses...\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX Loaded (several hundred) addresses from peers.dat  9ms\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX init message: Done loading\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX msghand thread start\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX opencon thread start\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX addcon thread start\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX net thread start\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX dnsseed thread start\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX Loading addresses from DNS seeds (could take a while)\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX 0 addresses found from DNS seeds\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX dnsseed thread exit\r\n        (omit interspersed \"receive version message\", both with\r\n         us=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion:8333 and us=dotted quad)\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting seed.bitcoin.sipa.be\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting dnsseed.bluematt.me\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting seed.bitcoinstats.com\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected seed.bitcoinstats.com\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting bitseed.xf2.org\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting seed.bitcoin.sipa.be\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected seed.bitcoin.sipa.be\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting dnsseed.bluematt.me\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting bitseed.xf2.org\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting dnsseed.bluematt.me\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected dnsseed.bluematt.me\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting bitseed.xf2.org\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connecting XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n    2015-10-XX XX:XX:XX SOCKS5 connected XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.onion\r\n        (usually stops attempting seeds ~30m after startup)\r\n\r\n@laanwj says \"if you have a proxy it [still] does AddOneShot(seed.host)\" and I dimly recall something about an exception being required for bootstrap before Core had an onion seed list, otherwise bootstrap would go nowhere.  Even if the user is aware of that, the persistent attempted connections to the seeds for a while *after* apparent `dnsseed thread exit` cause confusion (although maybe that peer starvation I mentioned is a prerequisite for getting confused).\r\n\r\nHaving healthy peer lists on these nodes already, I'm sure I can just use `dnsseed=0`, but I think it's worth making my existing configuration less surprising.  `onlynet=tor` really should mean \"just onion peers\", or be renamed, or have clearly documented exceptions, because smells like the the sort of thing that bites you down the road when new code or an unexpected use case comes along.",
