I'll rebase this PR to be up to date with #11403, and rebase it to master once it has been merged.\r\n\r\nExposes the `addresstype` parameter through the GUI.\r\nCurrently directly changes the `g_address_type` global variable instead of requiring an application restart, I'm not sure if this is good practice, but could easily be changed if needed.\r\n\r\nRadio buttons seem to be acting a bit different compared to other GUI elements, so that's why the code is somewhat different than for other settings.",
