If not, it would store the blockchain and other non-wallet data _in the application package itself_ and put a symlink in `~/Application Support/Bitcoin` so Bitcoind can find it. This might be quite brittle though.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to put an uninstall button inside QT, somewhere in the settings. This would work for Linux as well. In Windows it would just launch the standalone uninstaller. The uninstall button would have a check box:\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to delete the blockchain data? [x GB]\", checked by default\r\n\r\nIn addition it would say: \"your wallet will remain in [PATH]\" and will be used again if you decide to reinstall in the future.",
