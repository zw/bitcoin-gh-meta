There are other things potentially can be used. I'm open to suggestions.\r\n* `rpc_timeout` - I think `rpc_timeout` is usually sometime different than timeout people want to configure for syncing operations. Unless there is a factor that can be applied to `rpc_timeout` to estimate syncing timeout. Open to suggestions. \r\n* `nodes` - We can by default sync all nodes and take in a parameter in `sync_blocks` and `sync_mempool` in case subset of nodes need to be synced. This way we get rid of `nodes` input of those two functions. \r\n\r\n> +1 to Jonas, just appeasing test/lint/lint-python.sh for now would be better.\r\n \r\n`lint-python.sh` gives me other linting errors which is not related to the file I touched. I guess I'll just make those five files I touched to be pep8 in a separate commit. If it's not necessary, it's easy to take it out.\r\n```\r\ntest/functional/p2p_compactblocks.py:688:43: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/p2p_compactblocks.py:694:13: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/p2p_compactblocks.py:697:17: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/p2p_dos_header_tree.py:37:38: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/p2p_dos_header_tree.py:42:31: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/p2p_dos_header_tree.py:43:55: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/test_framework/messages.py:70:22: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/test_framework/messages.py:142:16: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/test_framework/messages.py:161:24: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/test_framework/messages.py:177:23: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/wallet_labels.py:149:13: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/functional/wallet_labels.py:155:13: E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'\r\ntest/lint/lint-python.sh: line 105: mypy: command not found\r\n```\r\n\r\n> > Does it make sense to move `assert (all([len(x.getpeerinfo()) for x in rpc_connections]))` up to immediately after the while loop starts?
