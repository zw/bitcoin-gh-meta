   "body" : "From the included comment:\r\n\r\nHomebrew may create symlinks in `/usr/local/include` for some packages. Because MacOS's clang internally adds `-I /usr/local/include` to its search paths, this will negate efforts to use `-isystem` for those packages, as they will be found first in `/usr/local`. Use the internal `-internal-isystem` option to system-ify all `/usr/local/include` paths without adding it to the list of search paths in case it's not already there.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue explained here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26056#issuecomment-1243362059\r\n\r\n~Also temporarily includes #26056 as a test. I will remove that commit if/when c-i is happy, and @fanquake can rebase it post-merge.~\r\nI've removed this commit now that c-i succeeded with it.",
