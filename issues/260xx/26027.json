   "body" : "This PR has bitcoin print a more verbose message when a network argument collisions happens. \r\nI'm new to using the bitcoin software and was reconfiguring an old node. I also have limited experience at coding, this is my first PR on an open-source project, so any feedback on how to improve this process is welcomed.\r\n\r\nIf a chain argument is in the bitcoin.conf and then a bitcoin command has a network flag or a chain argument, such as : bitcoind -regtest  currently you are presented with the message:\r\n```\r\n\"Invalid combination of -regtest, -signet, -testnet and -chain. Can use at most one.\"\r\n```\r\nAs I am a new to this software, with not knowing that the bitcoin.conf was being merge in the command line, I was at a loss until I got guidance in the bitcoin-core-dev irc. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a more verbose error by splitting out \"IsArgSet\" in system.cpp::ArgsManager::GetChainName() into a new function that can check if chain is set in the config(persistently) and/or the command line(non persistently). In the future, if a user makes this error, they will be notified of where the collision is happening. This isn't by any means a significant improvement to the software, but from the perspective of a new user, it would have been quite helpful.\r\n\r\nThe new error is a bit more verbose for the command bitcoind -regtest if the chain argument is set in the command line.\r\n```\r\n\"Invalid combination of -regtest, -signet, -testnet and -chain. Can use at most one. Chain argument is being set in a config file and by network arguments in the commandline.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In regards to the unit test util_tests/util_ChainMerge:**\r\n\r\nI had to write a script to check if the resulting output of master branch was the same output as the test from my branch and then update the hash accordingly. It is a simple compare of two txt files.\r\n\r\nYou can download the scripts here:\r\nhttps://github.com/amovfx/btc-argument-collision-warning.git\r\n\r\nThe functional tests I was wondering if they should just be respectively moved to interface_bitcoin_cli.py and feature_config_args.py instead of a separate file feature_chain_args_collision.py.\r\n\r\nI understand that your time is valuable and this isn't a significant change but I thought it was something within my ability I could contribute. Thank you for your time. \r\nAlso, thanks to everyone that helped me get to this point to even submit a PR.
