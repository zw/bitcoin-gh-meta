   "body" : "The `SelectCoinsBnB` algorithm computes the waste score while it's trying to find a match.  Then, if it finds a match, it computes the waste score a second time [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L159)  To simplify the code (particularly since this is a complex section) its easier to digest and understand if it does one thing, to find a possible selection.  I don't think having it calculate the waste score twice adds much and we can depend on the test harness to make sure the waste score is correct.",
