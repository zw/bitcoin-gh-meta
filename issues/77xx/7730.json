   "body" : "This removes the functionality behind `estimatepriority` and `estimatesmartpriority`.  The rpc calls are now deprecated.  `estimatepriority` will return -1 always and `estimatesmartpriority` will return 1e24 if the mempool is currently limited and -1 otherwise.  The result of this behavior is that free transactions (if selected using the now debug option `-sendfreetransactions`) can be created and sent if the mempool is not currently limited and the transaction's priority is above the hard coded AllowFree threshold.\n\nThis is effectively the behavior in place already as priority estimates do not appear until confirmation targets over 50 which aren't currently supported.\n\nA side effect of this is that now all transactions (that aren't dependent on unformed inputs) are now considered data points for fee estimation.  Even though some transactions may be mined due to their priority instead of fee, this is still safe because the threshold for fee estimation is very high (95%).\n",
