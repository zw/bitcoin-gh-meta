This is a required, but up to now missing part of deprecating the account system.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to rule out any other work that is being done such as multi-wallet support. I think this is pretty much orthogonal. As for alternative wallets, they've been proposed since at least 2012 - but none have materialized yet. And none of this change rules them out.\r\n",

Need to think about this a bit.\r\n\r\nI thought of the following: you could use two labels, one for the 'active' address, one for the 'normal'. Say `mining_active` and `mining`.\r\n\r\nWhen the miner needs an address it will:\r\n- *addr* = `getaddressesbylabel mining_active` (if no address returned, go to \"if so\" directly below and skip the first)\r\n- `getreceivedbyaddress` - check with wallet that *addr* has been used before (or maybe add a more convenient RPC call for checking a single address)\r\n- If so:\r\n  -  `setlabel <addr> mining`  - move current address to normal label\r\n  - *addr* = `getnewaddress mining_active` - generate new address in `mining_active` label\r\n  - Use *addr* for mining to\r\n- If not:\r\n  - Use *addr* for mining to\r\n\r\nThis is a little bit more involved at the user side, but it avoids special administration (needing to keep around `CAccount` structure per label) at the server side.",

Discussion confirms my intuition that it's better to get rid of this. \r\n  - 'acc' database entries, as well as CAccount, would not be necessary for labels. After this change, labels have no metadata, so a lot of code can be simplified.\r\n- `setlabel` on an address that already has the same label should be a no-op\r\n- Documentation changes / nits\r\n\r\n>  RPC which upgrades the wallet to a new version, and on the new version, hide the account RPCs. The enablelabels RPC should describe the implications of moving from accounts to labels. I think this requires a bit more thought and discussion.\r\n\r\nAgree re: versioning. We already have a command line argument to upgrade the wallet version, `-upgradewallet`. Wouldn't that be enough?\r\nEither label or account RPCs could be usable based on the wallet version.\r\nI don't see why a RPC to do the upgrade would be preferable, it's something that will be done at most once.\r\n",

Wouldn't that be enough\r\n\r\nACK - yes this is enough.\r\n\r\nThe wallet startup command line arguments always seemed strange to me, and if we were building this from scratch we might implement upgradewallet as an RPC or an external tool. However, it makes sense to use the existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\n> Either label or account RPCs could be usable based on the wallet version.\r\n\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ sounds good to me.\r\n\r\nTwo additional points:\r\n\r\n1. Obviously documentation is key here. The wallet upgrade will effectively remove the accounts from the wallet, so we need to make sure users understand the implication before upgrading.\r\n2. When will we be able to remove the account code entirely? At that point will bitcoind no longer support wallets older than the new version? Is there precedence for how we deprecate wallet features like this?\r\n\r\n> Is this going forward?\r\n\r\nIt feels like we've missed the boat for 0.15. @laanwj - it'd be great to get this in early in the next cycle. I'll have some spare time in the next few weeks. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help here. I'm happy to help write and test the upgrade code.",
