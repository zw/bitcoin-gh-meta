It might be the Tor onion logo that is either green, yellow (if going through some not-quite-ready stage) or with a circle and line striking through it when not connected via Tor.\r\n\r\nThis would complement the Tor-related improvements in 0.12.0 and make it easier for users to determine whether they are connected via Tor without doing additional investigatory steps, such as using the  `-debug=tor` switch.",
