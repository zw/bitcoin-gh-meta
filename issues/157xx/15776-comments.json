So over time, as NOTFOUND's pile up, the in-flight queue would get full and we'd stop requesting transactions.  So we should definitely take some kind of fix for this, yikes.",

I think we should definitely do this and backport to 0.18.\r\n\r\n(b) As a safeguard, we should also do something if a peer's in-flight count hits the max so that we're not downloading new transactions from them.  I think there are two responses that make sense to me: either we eventually disconnect them, or we expire the in-flight entry and make room for a new request.  For 0.18,  I think expiry makes more sense, as it's more robust to other bugs that may be lurking in this new code.  Eventually, I think disconnection is where I expect things to go in the long-run (which is what we do for block getdata's that are dropped by the peer).\r\n\r\nAlso, I think I spotted another bug in this code related to emptying out the tx_in_flight set -- if a different peer serves us a transaction that we requested from another, then the entry doesn't get removed (upon receiving a TX message, we only erase from the delivering peer's in_flight set).  So a \"DoS\"er that helpfully blasted us with transactions would be able to blind us to transactions from our other peers.  The expiry solution would mitigate this, which is a point in its favor for merging into 0.18, but we should fix this too I think if we can do so easily.",

It looks like most of the time these are for tx's that aren't even in my mempool at all anymore, though that varies between peers:\r\n\r\n * peer=0 -- 2821 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n * peer=3 -- 1495 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n * peer=1 -- 1092 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n\r\n * peer=5 -- 401 not in mempool, 117 in mempool\r\n * peer=4 -- 308 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n * peer=2 -- 146 not in mempool, 0 in mempool\r\n\r\n * peer=102 -- 73 in mempool, 14 not in mempool\r\n * peer=204 -- 111 in mempool, 3 not in mempool\r\n\r\nFor the ones that are in the mempool, the times are all just >15m as expected (ranging from 902s to 17432s -- almost 5 hours), and the parent explanation seems fine for them.\r\n\r\nNot sure what's causing other nodes to request tx's that aren't in my mempool anymore though.

We are using `mapRelay` to store the transaction pointers and it is populated at the same time the inv gets sent. (Of course a timeout of an entry in `mapRelay` might cause the issue mentioned here, but that shouldn't occur so frequently)",
