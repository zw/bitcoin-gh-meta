If there are no issues, the notary service generates a ticket for you to staple to your software; the notary service also publishes that ticket online where Gatekeeper can find it.\r\n\r\n> Beginning in **macOS 10.14.5**, all new or updated kernel extensions and all software from developers new to distributing with Developer ID must be notarized in order to run. In a future version of macOS, notarization will be required by default for all software.\r\n\r\nThe currently available version of macOS is 10.14.4.\r\n\r\nApple's notary service requires you to adopt the following protections:\r\n* Enable code-signing for all of the executables you distribute.\r\n* Enable the Hardened Runtime capability for your executable targets, as described in Enable hardened runtime.\r\n* Use a `Developer ID` application, kernel extension, or installer certificate for your code-signing signature.\r\n* Include a secure timestamp with your code-signing signature. (The Xcode distribution workflow includes a secure timestamp by default. For custom workflows, include the `--timestamp` option when running the codesign tool.)\r\n* DonÃ¢ÂÂt include the `com.apple.security.get-task-allow` entitlement with the value set to any variation of true.\r\n* Link against the macOS 10.9 or later SDK.\r\n\r\nMore info available here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution",
