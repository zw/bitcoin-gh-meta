(Regrettably, it's hard for me to recommend a specific one; the developers are generally available on Freenode IRC, but it's important not to trust anybody whose bonafides you can't verify, and -- you probably already know this, but to be sure -- in general do not trust _anybody_ with private keys, or any bitcoin output you aren't _completely sure_ does not contain or reveal private keys. The actual developers will be scrupulously careful to avoid asking you for anything that would reveal them.)",
