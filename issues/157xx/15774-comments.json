This would need to be performed by the code signer.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, the binary package will then be recognized by GateKeeper, providing that an active internet connection is available. It is possible to \"staple\" the notarization receipt to the binary package so that an internet connection is not required, but that would change it's sha256sum, which would no longer match the hashes from gitian's output.\r\n\r\nNote: There is an intermittent bug in Apple's notarization system that may block the binary from being notarized properly.

For those interested, here is what I needed to do to automate the task on travis:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/btcpayserver/BTCPayServer.Vault/blob/master/Build/travis/applesign.sh\r\n\r\nBasically, I needed to:\r\n* extract the unsigned dmg,\r\n* sign the app,\r\n* rebundle the app as a dmg,\r\n* sign the dmg,\r\n* notarize the dmg,\r\n* wait that it succeed\r\n* Apply the staple to the dmg\r\n\r\nNote that applying the staple to the dmg is optional. However, if you don't apply it, gatekeeper will need internet connection to verify the dmg.\r\n\r\nI think that I should also **staple the .App folder** itself and not only the dmg if I wanted gatekeeper to be 100% happy when offline. (yes, you can staple the .App folder... I have no idea why it works, where the staple get saved?)\r\nThe documentation is very bad, so I don't really know...\r\n\r\nIf you want to also staple the `.App` I think you need a two steps notarization: First the `.App` folder as a tar file, then the dmg after it has been built.\r\n\r\nTake a good note about the parameters I passed to `codesign`, this took a while to get right.",

I guess it can't. It only tells Apples Gatekeeper server that the gitian built .dmg file was notarized with someone holding the macOS code signing keys. Manually notarizing a malicious .dmg by a maintainer would still require to distribute that malicious .dmg somehow (also codesign).\r\n\r\nAnyways, our binary distribution security is based on a completely different layer (deterministic builds with multiple signatures). The os protection with code-signing and notarization is nice but provides much less trust/security IMO.\r\n\r\nPing @theuni @dongcarl.",

Though user can disable the notarization check in the macOS security settings.\r\n\r\nIt's mandatory since 10.14.5 (means the default security setting only allows notarized apps to launch).\r\n\r\nThere is an option to add the notarization ticket directly to the app to allow offline users to check the notarization (Apple calls that stapling).

But I agree, if we decide to notarize (and I guess we have to), stapling the ticket to the app is the preferred approach.\r\n\r\nI just checked what stapling actually does.\r\nIt adds a file `CodeResources` to the application bundle (all other files are untouched).\r\nWe could add that `CodeResources` file to the detach signature git and \"apply\" it during gitian-osx-signer process.\r\n\r\nThe process would look like:\r\n* the macOS code signer needs to run the .dmg creation step (a manual gitian-osx-signer.yml) after he ran the `detached-sig-create.sh`\r\n* ... then, he needs to notarize the created .dmg file\r\n* ... staple the notarization ticket to the .app folder (creates the `CodeResources` file)\r\n* ... commit the detached signatures & the `CodeResources` file to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs\r\n* ... all gitian builders pull the signature & the `CodeResource` file and apply it to the .app folder and create the dmg\r\n\r\nDownside:\r\n* More work for the macOS code signer (acceptable IMO)\r\n* Notarization happens before we have proof of determinism and the possibility to check the hashes of other gitian builds (we already have that problem with code signing)\r\n* No current reliable proof if this would not break determinism (I think it wouldn't)",
