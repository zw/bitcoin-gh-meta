Or were the binaries signed without a Developer ID somehow?\r\n\r\nThis is how I too initially understood the documentation. However, as others have pointed out, this does not seem to be the case. With my own project that has distributed code signed binaries for a while now, those same code signed binaries, when downloaded, are actually blocked from running on Catalina with the message shown in @moneyball 's screenshot.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNotarization can be done either _after-the-fact_ (post-release) for existing code signed binaries, or during the release process' final steps using `altool` (see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow for command examples starting at the \"Upload Your App to the Notarization Service\" section). This would need to be performed by the code signer.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, the binary package will then be recognized by GateKeeper, providing that an active internet connection is available. It is possible to \"staple\" the notarization receipt to the binary package so that an internet connection is not required, but that would change it's sha256sum, which would no longer match the hashes from gitian's output.\r\n\r\nNote: There is an intermittent bug in Apple's notarization system that may block the binary from being notarized properly.
