   "body" : "When I Google for \"bitcoin core rpc\" I find a bunch of pages that are a bit confusing. What I am looking for is https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis. But there are multiple others confusing matches and I suggest a few improvements for them:\r\n\r\n1. The top result is https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/. This has fairly little information and is, IMO, a distraction.\r\n2. The second result is https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC). This is not about RPC commands at all. Rather, it is a (partial?) list of language clients. The page should be renamed. Also, it might help to place a link to the RPC calls documentation at the top of this page.\r\n3. The third result is https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list which is entirely obsolete I think. Can this be deleted?\r\n4. The fourth result is https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference which is the page I want but the wrong anchor. Not sure what can be done about this.\r\n5. The next result is https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Bitcoind which seems reasonable but has a lot of obsolete stuff on it as well.\r\n\r\nI might be wrong about these points but I wanted to express my confusion as a normal developer just trying to find the documentation of all available commands. I hope this helps.",
