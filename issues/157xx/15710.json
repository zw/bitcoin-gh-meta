   "body" : "In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2950 a hash of the pubkey and private was added to speed up key import, this was made backwards compatible by reading the hash in a try block with an ellipses catch all in case the hash was not present.\r\n\r\nCDataStream::read() specifically throws std::ios_base::failure, backwards compatibility expects only that error to be thrown, if something else gets thrown we should not be catching it. The change in this commit is to catch that exception only. If any other exception is thrown other than std::ios_base::failure it will be caught by the wider try block and an error written to the log and/or console.\r\n\r\nFor reference CDataStream::read() throwing std::ios_base::failure.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/streams.h#L191",
