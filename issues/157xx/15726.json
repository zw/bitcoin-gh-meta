   "body" : "This adds a `-yaml` option to bitcoin-cli to output RPC responses formatted in YAML instead of JSON, mostly intended to be more human-readable. In particular, it adds `_` as a thousands separator both before and after the decimal point, and aligns adjacent numeric fields via the decimal point. Since it's yaml, it uses a bit less syntax than json (ie, fewer quotes, no trailing commas, no brackets).\r\n\r\n(Looking for conceptACKs; it treads a cpp file as a header rather than making it a .o and doesn't allow yaml output via the gui debug console which would presumably make sense)",
