But while I understand the impulse to want to replace old code with new code and drop support for things like creating wallets in the current format, I think the PR could be actually simpler, and users would be better off if this took a more conservative approach and just added descriptor functionality as a new optional feature alongside existing functionality, rather than trying to:\r\n\r\n1. add new descriptor support\r\n2. add an upgrade function\r\n3. replace old code and tests\r\n\r\nall in a single PR. It seems to me if this PR just stuck to (1) and saved (2) and (3) for later followup this would be easier to review, and we would have more opportunity to iterate and hammer out any problems with the new descriptor code and design while leaving existing functionality intact.\r\n\r\nAndrew could correct me if I'm wrong, but I think in practice doing what I'm suggesting wouldn't involve big changes to the PR. Mostly just restoring removed code, and maybe copying and updating existing python tests instead of updating them in place. Or adding --descriptor options to the python tests and running both variants.",

This PR handles that with `SetPrimaryDescriptor`, etc. My approach was to add a purpose int to each descriptor `DESCRIPTOR_PURPOSE_[RECEIVE,CHANGE]_[CURRENT,ARCHIVE]`. No strong preference. I would probably rename `Primary` to `Receive` though.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm not a fan of:\r\n* LoadDescriptor expands a descriptor and then throws keys and script into the global wallet (e.g. `AddScriptPubKey`); I prefer if descriptor objects handle their own IsMine stuff.\r\n\r\nTo keep this PR small I suggest, in additon to what @jnewbery summarizes:\r\n* don't add private key support (I do think we should have a WIP PR that adds private key support, to get a rough feel for what needs to happen)",
