Thus, it pays 53010/5349 = 9.91 satoshi/byte. This seems on the low side. [Here](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) you can see the transactions in the mempool, aggregated by fee per byte.",

Bitcoin should have some type of fixed-fee (e.g. 10,000 sat?) DROP_TRANSACTION tx that can be sent out from any other wallet or key, something that miners would be likely to accept [edit, no it would need to be the same key as used for sending the tx, to prove this is a \"drop\" sent by, and only by, the holder of they key making the original tx, does that make sense?  So the public key can be verified).\r\n\r\nThis should cause the DROP_TRANSACTION to be mined in a block, which could perhaps purge the limbo tx from the mempool.  If that happens, the new script could be read by other miners accepting the confirmed block to also purge the tx, with the desired outcome being the funds are reverted back as if it never happened in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'd like to try and implement this feature, but there's almost always no help available and a lot of missing documentation for developers who want to contribute to Bitcoin Core or other similar projects like forks.\r\n\r\nA brief example:\r\n\r\nGood script and other documentation should outline the rough steps on adding a new script opcode and exactly how Bitcoin interprets scripts with a broad overview of the stack-based language.\r\n\r\nIt should contain a few concrete, simple examples, along with testing information (e.g. implement, get on regnet, write test cases and document).  It should contain information on why some opcodes are disabled and pointers to code comments on why some are now renamed and re-implemented, for example an EQUAL op now being a specific numeric EQUAL opcode, and how to think about new scripts and opcodes and whether they may pose a DoS attack risk or an unintended behavior risk.\r\n\r\nI would contribute documentation and get on with pull requests, but there's very little to go on to get a start with.  It doesn't matter whether the pull request is rejected for any reason or the code is just rubbish; at least it would help developers get a bit of a jump start making contributions.\r\n\r\nI hope this is interpreted as constructive criticism rather than a rant!",
