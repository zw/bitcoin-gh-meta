Rather than combat transaction-relay based inferences, which I think is a lost cause in the long-run even if there are improvements we can make in the short-term, I figure we can directly address why we care about keeping the graph private.\r\n\r\nSome considerations I had while working on this:\r\n\r\n * Is 2 the right number of blocks-only connections?  From a robustness standpoint, more connections like this are better; however there's a tradeoff with resource utilization.  Two resources that occurred to me to worry about were the memory used by each CNode object (hence the refactor commits that allow the transaction-relay data structures to not be instantiated for the blocks-only peers), and the number of connection slots on the network (I figure going from 8 to 10 is not that bad?).  I also did some simulations to verify that a random graph of 10000 peers would be fully connected if each peer makes 2 outbound connections to random other peers, which I thought was a good justification for 2 being a useful number of outbounds to add.\r\n\r\n * How should addrman interactions work on these blocks-only connections?  My approach attempts to leave addrman unchanged as a result of these connections, neither processing addr messages nor sending any, to avoid leaking information via addr messages that we relay to other peers.  But I have not given a lot of thought to what kind of attacks are possible using addrman, nor what the consequences are to not updating addrman with information from our blocks-only peers.\r\n",

      "body" : "Perhaps the accounting logic should be improved to be clearer, but I believe the behavior here is at least (roughly) correct. The way this works is that if a user sets `-maxconnections` very low, that will be a hard limit on the number of inbound, outbound and outbound-blocks-only connections.  Before this PR, it would take the user setting their max connections value to less than 8 to change the number of outbound connections we make (we first reduce all the inbound we take and only then reduce the outbound).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new blocks-only connections and preferences those connections over regular outbound connections (whenever we make an outbound connection, we check to see if we are below our blocks-only target, and if so we initiate the connection as blocks-only).  As a result, I thought it didn't make sense to have any blocks-only links if we have too few regular outbound connections, because I don't think it makes sense to have blocks-only links at the expense of transaction relay.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the problem with the suggestion of just setting nMaxOutboundBlocksOnly to 2 is that if the user passes `-maxconnections=2`, then they'll only have 2 blocksonly peers and won't receive any transactions.\r\n\r\nSo I believe the way I implemented things here is that we try to reserve 6 connections as regular outbound, and then if we add additional connections we will have those be blocks-only until we get to 2, and then any further connections are regular outbounds up to 8, and then finally any additional ones are used for feelers and inbounds.\r\n\r\nOf course we could change this to be more conservative and only allocate blocks-only connections if we have all 8 regular outbounds.  However I don't think we should be less conservative and risk having fewer regular outbounds.",

Since we relay, I guess there is no chance we could identify (and thus disconnect) black-hole peers?\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli With 2 blocks-only connections, and if we assume 5% of nodes are useless black holes, then my simulation suggests we have a 3% chance of the network graph being connected by _only_ the blocks-only connections.  For additional robustness, we will want to add more blocks-only connections in the future -- but for resource utilization reasons I don't want to do that until we add better support at the p2p protocol layer for establishing these connections.\r\n\r\nNote that we are still going to relay blocks on the existing 8 outbound connections, so this PR is purely additive robustness, at the cost of a little more resource utilization.  We now will have 10 outbound peers, rather than 8, which are able to provide blocks to us.  (We just aren't going to do tx relay on the two additional connections.)\r\n\r\nOne issue I'd like to flag for reviewers is how these new blocksonly peers interact with outbound peer disconnection (introduced in #11560 and #11490).  I believe I've implemented this so that the new blocksonly peers will not be subject to other forms of disconnection, because non-tx-relay outbounds are excluded from being outbound disconnection candidates.  However, it's worth verifying the implementation is correct and worth thinking about whether this behavior is the best choice.\r\n",

But how much?\r\nI measured compact block relay RTT **between 2 random private nodes** in a Bitcoin-like network with pre-relayed transactions (via [Erlay or BTCFlood](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518)).\r\n\r\n|                        | Best case (empty block) | Erlay tx relay  | BTCFlood tx relay |\r\n|------------------------|----------|---------|-----|\r\n| 8 + 0 links | 1.86 RTT | 1.9 RTT  | 2.06 RTT |\r\n| 8 + 2 links | 1.8 RTT  | 1.82 RTT | 2.0 RTT |\r\n| 8 + 8 links | 1.71 RTT  | 1.71 RTT | 1.91 RTT |\r\n\r\nIt seems like we can reduce compact block relay latency by 7% with 8 extra blocks-only links.\r\nIt's hard to tell how it translates into orphan rate, but seems not significant to me.\r\n",

Adding blocks-only connections gives us a lot of resiliency for very little added complexity, and opens the door to safely doing more sophisticated peer management of our regular outbounds. Hopefully we can soon bump up the number of blocks-only connections we make (over the regular 8 outbounds) after we make the marginal memory burden per blocks-only connection low (some `CNodeState` tweaks?).\r\n\r\n### Review notes\r\n```\r\n- [x] e101770e19 Remove unused variable\r\n\r\n- [x] 3742ffd1c2 [refactor] Move tx relay state to separate structure\r\n\r\n  Lock splitting happens (cs_inventory -> {cs_inventory,cs_tx_inventory}\r\n\r\n- [x] 1794eef544 [refactor] Change tx_relay structure to be unique_ptr\r\n\r\n  Super easy to review.\r\n\r\n- [x] 196913ae33 Check that tx_relay is initialized before access\r\n\r\n  Grep'd for all usages of m_tx_relay, checked that they were guarded by\r\n  conditional.\r\n\r\n  Most easily reviewed with `-w`.\r\n\r\n- [x] c72414f65c Add comment explaining intended use of m_tx_relay\r\n\r\n- [x] c987790152 Add 2 outbound blocks-only connections\r\n\r\n  Long lines are hard to review on Github, but that's an out-of-scope nit.\r\n\r\n- [x] 32d8ac4ce6 Don't relay addr messages to block-relay-only peers\r\n\r\n- [x] c73ff2cfa5 fixup!

Successfully synced to network tip. \r\n\r\nVerified that starting up with `-maxconnections=4` makes no blocks-only connections.\r\n",

There is [map-z](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09755.pdf) paper which infers topology in Zcash, but it's a lot simplier than Bitcoin, because they have smaller network, blocks are processed longer, a significant portion of nodes produce blocks, etc. I'm trying to see how easy it would be to use something similar in Bitcoin at the moment, but I tend to agree it's difficult now (especially with Fibre and Compact Blocks).",

And adding additional outbound peers should make the network more robust to partition attacks.  So even if topology inference is still possible, this PR should only be making our code strictly better, from a security standpoint.\r\n\r\nFrom a performance standpoint, this PR does increase the resource usage for these additional connections, but if that is sufficiently small (as I believe it would be, in this patch) I think we would not regret it.\r\n\r\n(Also, if it turns out that approaches like the one described in the Map-Z paper work on the bitcoin network to infer these blocks-only links, then I suspect it should still be relatively straightforward to neutralize that kind of approach by, say, intentionally delaying block relay on these links so that in the absence of an attack on the rest of a node's peers, these would not be inferable.  I think we can discuss these kinds of hypothetical mitigations once an attack becomes apparent.)",

Possibly the same thing in the `strCommand == NetMsgType::TX` block?\r\n\r\nThanks, that is a good catch -- the intention was for peers violating blocks-only mode to be disconnected, as you suggest.  I'll push a fix.  **EDIT**: Actually, it appears that we do not disconnect peers from sending us tx inv's if we're running in -blocksonly mode, as I thought we did.  I think we should, as the whole point is to reduce bandwidth in -blocksonly mode, but this will be a behavior change.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I think I've occasionally seen this behavior from other peers myself where blocks-only connections still result in our peer sending us inv's.  I have never been able to reproduce with Bitcoin Core, but it does make me wonder if there might be some kind of rare bug where the blocks-only field is somehow ignored?",

So this PR changes that to 6 and always includes these blocks-only peers.  Protecting some peers at all from this logic is just belt-and-suspenders prevention of some kind of cascading failure, so it's not clear to me how to think about changing the logic, whether I should include these blocks-only peers in the protected set or not?\r\n\r\nOne advantage to protecting them is that it simplifies the reasoning over how to connect to a new peer when connecting to an extra outbound peer if the tip hasn't advanced in a while -- right now, we always connect as a full-relay peer, and then we evict one of our full-relay peers.  If we don't protect the blocks-only peers, this logic will be more annoying to write.",
