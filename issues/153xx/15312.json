   "body" : "Running Bitcoind and Bitcoin-qt on Ubuntu 18.04 crashes server that is being hosted on VMWare 6.5 Hyper-visor\r\n\r\nWhen I install it and it starts the IBD, the entire VM Freezes and becomes unresponsive\r\n\r\nBeing that the directions for installation is for Ubuntu, I would assume that would be the best OS to start with. However, I can get it to run on a windows 10 VM but not Ubuntu VM. \r\n\r\nAs soon as it is finished compiling and installing, I start the Bitcoin app in Ubuntu. Sometimes it freezes the entire OS when syncing the headers or sometimes it freezes when just connecting to peers. \r\n\r\nThe occurs every time. I create a new, clean install of Ubuntu Server or Ubuntu Desktop and then install Bitcoin Core. It does not matter if I get the Bitcoin app from the Ubuntu based app repo or if I compile it directly from this Github. Same results. \r\n\r\nI have tried to run v0.17.1, v0.17.0 and v0.16.0. All have the same results. I have also tried Ubuntu 16.05, 14.04 and 18.04. Both Server and Desktop version of all 3. Same results. \r\n\r\nI provided the VM with 4 CPU cores (2.3 Ghz) and 6GB of ram. When this occurs, the usage never goes above 35% cpu usage, and 4GB of ram. It has a Static Virtual Hard disk with 1TB of space on it. This is running on a HP Proliant Gen9 Server.\r\n\r\nAttaching the debug for Ubuntu Desktop 18.04. \r\n[debug.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/2820559/debug.txt)\r\n",
