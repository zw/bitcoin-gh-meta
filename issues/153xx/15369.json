Because with this design, reusing the above setup, since the first setup I have already used up all the amount in U1 and U2, 2.9999BTC + 0.0001BTC fee. If I want to increase the fee, I must include another UTXO or I have to reduce the amount to spent in output to leave space for the relay fee.\r\n\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
