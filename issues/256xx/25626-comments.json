The values could be confusing for some users. I think you had even agreed to add the option with same name in 2019: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16171#issuecomment-501652078. \r\n\r\n> Even if there were other policies, they'd require at least one miner to support them.

Absent a use case (or a single user) for those policies, it would be better to not add support for them for now.\r\n\r\nUsers, miners etc. only try policies that are available in a bitcoin core based on the trend since RBF was implemented in core. So developers are deciding the policies not the users. If full RBF really increases miners revenue as claimed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353 they would be running bitcoin knots in last few years instead of core which isn't true. It would be interesting to ask some mining pools if they care to experiment with RBF policies or use the ones available in core.\r\n\r\n> So writing \"dead\" code to achieve a goal which is already achieved will just confuse devs and users. Thus may actually decrease effective compatibility due to user confusion.\r\n\r\nIt is a workaround and a few other config options can be removed if such workarounds are less confusing for users. ",
