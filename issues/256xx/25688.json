   "body" : "Should close #25265\r\n\r\nThe onion proxy can be set either via `-onion` or via `-proxy` (grep `init.cpp` for `onion_proxy`). Additionally, when TorControl is configured and successfully connected, there is a fallback that tries to setup the onion proxy via that connection. This fallback was only checking if `-onion` was set but if `-proxy` was set it was still running and overwriting the existing onion proxy configured in `-proxy`.\r\n\r\nInstead of using `gArgs` I am checking if a valid proxy is set already. This should not make a difference in behavior since init error are thrown if `-onion` or `-proxy` are set but not valid. There is also another check if `-onion` or `-proxy` are explicitly disabled. I think this is the most reasonable behavior for such corner cases, though I am not sure if there are valid use cases for such a configuration.\r\n\r\nThis also adds some more explicit logging that should help users better understand what is happening.",
