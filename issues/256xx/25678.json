   "body" : "Currently, `-onlynet` does not work well in connection with initial peer discovery, because DNS seeds only resolve to IPv6 and IPv4 adresses:\r\nWith `-onlynet=i2p`, we would load clearnet addresses from DNS seeds into addrman, be content our addrman isn't empty so we don't try to query hardcoded seeds (although these exist for i2p!), and never attempt make an automatic outbound connection.\r\nWith `-onlynet=onion`, we wouldn't load addresses via DNS, but might use the fallback to make a clearnet connection to a random peer the DNS seed resolves to (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6808#issuecomment-147652505), thus breaching the `-onlynet` preference of the user - this has been reported in the two issues listed below.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two changes:\r\n1.) Don't load addresses that are unreachable (so that we wouldn't connect to them) into addrman. This is already the case for addresses received via p2p addr messages, this PR implements the same for addresses received from DNS seeds and fixed seeds. This means that in the case of `-onlynet=onion`, we wouldn't load fixed seed IPv4 addresses into addrman, only the onion ones.\r\n2.) Skip trying the DNS seeds if neither IPv4 nor IPv6 are reachable and move directly to adding the hardcoded seeds from networks we can connect to.\r\n\r\nFixes #6808\r\nFixes #12344",
