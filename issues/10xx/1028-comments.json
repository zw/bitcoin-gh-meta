Big picture:\r\n\r\n1) You'll have to move the AppInit2 call to its own QThread\r\n\r\n2) This thread has to tell the UI thread (through Qt signals) when certain functionality becomes available, so that the WalletModel / ClientModel can be constructed and passed into BitcoinGUI at the appropriate time. \r\n2.1) When in init phase, the progress bar should be updated to display the current init message, and maybe give an indication how far the process is along.\r\n\r\n3) BitcoinGUI is designed so that it will work with the WalletModel / ClientModel set to NULL initially. However, it wlll display nonsense. An empty transaction list and balance, at the very least. This should be hidden / changed to a \"loading...\" message. An possibility would be to show the splash screen image (as it looks nicer than text) inside the interface when it's loading...\r\n",
