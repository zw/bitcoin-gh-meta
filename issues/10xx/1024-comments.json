      "body" : "Update: I found the right pass it looks like the crash was being caused on an incorrect pass.\r\n\r\nUsing 0.6.0.6-beta trying (incorrect-password1) when attempting to send coins or change passwords the client crashes. Because of this I figured it was the correct password due to other incorrect passwords not causing the client to crash (they would just cause the client to report incorrect pass).\r\n\r\nFiguring that one or more of the keys were corrupted sipa gave me two custom clients. \r\n\r\nfirst patched client\r\nhttp://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/0.6.0-1-gc8bd77b/ (404'd now I guess you should ask him if you really need it)\r\nWhen this was run with -recovery flag it checks all keys at decryption time and ignores the faulty ones, so if you use the wrong pass it wont have any funds since the decryption will fail. This tried to use a key that was removed (when i stupidly was using the wrong pass at this point) since it doesnt prevent the coin mechanism from choosing those coins or update the balance.\r\n\r\nsecond patched client\r\nhttp://bitcoin.sipa.be/builds/0.6.0-1-g694cc14/\r\nagain you run this with -recovery from the cli or it will just be the same as 0.6.0.6-beta I believe. Using this patch it reports in the debug output which keys were removed because of which reason, and should update the balance. So if you use the wrong pass decryption will fail and the balance will show 0.00.\r\n\r\nAfter writing down all permutations of what my pass could be I found the correct passphrase and the released 0.6.0.6-beta client works as expected. I'll email the empty wallet to gmaxwell and hopefully he can figure out why the wrong pass causes it to crash.",
