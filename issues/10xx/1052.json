These are macros that define a local CCriticalBlock variable (a boost::interprocess::scoped_lock wrapper), which is much more C++ than the if and/or for constructions in macros.\r\n\r\nI've intentionally not touched formattng/indentation where possible, in order not to break other patches. There are several cases where simplications are possible now, though.\r\n",
