Most confusing possibility yet proposed. :(\r\n\r\nThe problem with relative progress is that people restart while syncing and freak out when it goes to zero... thinking that it's started from the start again. Some people have even given up on the reference client as a result of this (or so they say on IRC).\r\n\r\nBehavior that changes in ways that would take a paragraph to explain based on state which is hidden from the user is not intuitive at all. \r\n\r\nHowever, I like showing real block valuesÃ¢ÂÂ  but UI clueful people seem to think this is a bad idea.\r\n",
