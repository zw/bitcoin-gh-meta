   "body" : "This enables gitian builds from any operating system supporting Oracle VirtualBox and HashiCorp's vagrant and packer VM-creation utilities. Simply checkout a copy of the bitcoin source tree with this PR applied from an internet-connected machine, and do `cd contrib/vagrant && make`. Dependencies and build products are properly cached to provide faster subsequent builds. Builds from dirty working trees are also supported, with the uncommitted changes applied to the source tree.\r\n\r\nBuilds are nearly identical to the usual gitian process. At this time the only difference is due to a separate bug that makes the length of the `GIT_COMMIT_ID` string exported by git-archive dependent on the state of the local git repository, which has the further implication separate from this use case that over time it would prevent reproducibility of historical releases as well. That issue is logically separate and should be fixed on its own.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a re-opening of PR #1597 from July of 2012. Unfortunately GitHub forced creation of a new PR.",
