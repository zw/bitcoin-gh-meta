For instance, I tried using AX_LINK_IFELSE after AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG, but that uses CXXFLAGS not the new flags I added, and it has no option to take additional compile flags.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are other options if we don't want the new m4 file:\r\n * Could do a hack where we save old CXXFLAGS, update global CXXFLAGS and use AX_LINK_IFELSE, then set SANITIZER_CXXFLAGS to CXXFLAGS and restore the old CXXFLAGS variable\r\n * In #12695 I have a commit that adds better reliable detection for clang. If we want to use that we could just change the configure.ac logic to use AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG and then if we are not Clang also do an AC_CHECK_LIB check.\r\n\r\nLet's see how #12695 pans out though before continuing with this.",
