This will take a long time because it has to reprocess old blocks, but it won't re-download any blocks you already have locally.",

Apologies for the delay, I saved the entire folder containing the files producing this error so I could get back to it at a later stage but in the meanwhile I synced from scratch importing the private keys to a new wallet that is now running fine.\r\n\r\nI have now forced the client to use this corrupt data directory because I hope that my experience will help solving the issue that could occur to others.\r\n\r\nI have therefore run the client as you suggested with -debug=leveldb and here are the error messages obtained this time:\r\n\r\n[debug.log](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/1844934/debug.log)\r\n\r\ndb.log that is referenced to is totally blank, no information at all.\r\n\r\nI can see that it makes a reference to .dat files, please let me know which one you would like to analyze and I will happily upload it for you.\r\n\r\nMany thanks ",

The error message \"block checksum mismatch\" implies that LevelDB handed out data with checksum X to the kernel, but then later read that data back with checksum Y. That could be bad hardware, a bad filesystem, or anywhere in-between. But I don't think it's a bug in Bitcoin (or LevelDB).",
