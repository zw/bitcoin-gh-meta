   "body" : "This is another fragment of improvements from #10785.\r\n\r\nThe current serialization code does not support serializing/deserializing from/to temporaries (like `s >> CFlatData(script)`). As a result, there are many invocations of the `REF` macro which in addition to changing the reference type also changes the constness. This is unnecessary in C++11 as we can use rvalue references now instead.\r\n\r\nThe first commit is an extra simplification we can make that removes the duplication of code between `READWRITE` and `READWRITEMANY` (and related functions).",
