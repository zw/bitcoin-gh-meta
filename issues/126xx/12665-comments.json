It contains only locking annotations for which we are already asserting using `AssertLockHeld(Ã¢ÂÂ¦)`. Since this PR doesn't change runtime behaviour (compile-time checks only) it should be low risk.\r\n\r\nHaving this PR merged would make the other locking assertions PR:s much smaller and easier to review since this PR contains the bulk of the assertions which the other PR:s contain too.\r\n\r\nKeeping this PR rebased is getting a bit time consuming, so let me know if I can do anything to facilitate merging :-)",
