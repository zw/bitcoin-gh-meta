The payment to self is missing in the GUI. Normally, the GUI does list payments to self.\r\n\r\n`listtransactions` lists 3 transactions here: The send to the foreign address and a send/receive pair for the payment to self. I don't know if this is correct. I'm mentioning this so that the devs can make sure this is intended.\r\n\r\nSee transaction `5299f198919d6bd5b9f6d7a5f256b23417cb49ea663828f51cfc1b4d7e69822d` on testnet.\r\n",
