This is not the soft-fork activation logic needed to use tail-call scripts in production.\r\n\r\nTail-call semantics is a sort of user-programmable P2SH which combines well with BIP 116's MERKLEBRANCHVERIFY to allows for a script to commit to a practically unbounded number of code pathways, and then reveal the actual code pathway used at spend time, achieving a form of generalized MAST.\r\n",
