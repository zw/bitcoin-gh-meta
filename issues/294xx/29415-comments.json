      "body" : "@1440000bytes, thanks for asking! There is some discussion at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509 (the previous attempt on this).\r\n\r\n> Is it necessary to open new short lived tor/i2p connections for broadcasting the transaction?\r\n\r\nYes, it is. See below.\r\n\r\n> What are the trade-offs in this implementation vs a simple implementation to relay tx to one or more peers that our node is already connected to?\r\n\r\nSending the transaction over clearnet reveals the IP address/geolocation of the sender. A spy with many connections to the network could try to guess who was the originator. So, why not send it to our Tor peers only? Because it is relatively easy for a spy to fingerprint and link clearnet and Tor connections to the same peer. That is, a long running connection over Tor could be linked to a long running clearnet connection. This is why the proposed changes open a short-lived connection that does not reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n\r\nWould this benefit nodes that don't have clearnet connections, e.g. Tor/I2P-only nodes? Yes! In the case where the sender sends two otherwise unrelated transactions over the same long-running Tor connection, the recipient will know that they have the same origin, even though they are not related on-chain. Using single shot connections fixes that too.\r\n\r\n> Related issues:\r\n\r\nLinked in the OP, thanks!",
