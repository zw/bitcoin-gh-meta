      "body" : "@1440000bytes, thanks for asking! There is some discussion at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509 (the previous attempt on this).\r\n\r\n> Is it necessary to open new short lived tor/i2p connections for broadcasting the transaction?\r\n\r\nYes, it is. See below.\r\n\r\n> What are the trade-offs in this implementation vs a simple implementation to relay tx to one or more peers that our node is already connected to?\r\n\r\nSending the transaction over clearnet reveals the IP address/geolocation of the sender. A spy with many connections to the network could try to guess who was the originator. So, why not send it to our Tor peers only? Because it is relatively easy for a spy to fingerprint and link clearnet and Tor connections to the same peer. That is, a long running connection over Tor could be linked to a long running clearnet connection. This is why the proposed changes open a short-lived connection that does not reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n\r\nWould this benefit nodes that don't have clearnet connections, e.g. Tor/I2P-only nodes? Yes! In the case where the sender sends two otherwise unrelated transactions over the same long-running Tor connection, the recipient will know that they have the same origin, even though they are not related on-chain. Using single shot connections fixes that too.\r\n\r\n> Related issues:\r\n\r\nLinked in the OP, thanks!",

Currently using a 20-node [graph](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/test/data/onion.graphml) and a [scenario](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/src/scenarios/onion_init.py) which connects the graph, adds onion addresses to the test node, and then sends a raw transaction from the node running this branch.\r\n\r\nThe private broadcast succeeds frequently but not always. In Warnet anyway I had better luck when the test node had `-listenonion=0`, I tried that after suspecting that inbound onion connections were removing potential peers from the private broadcast list, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nI think I noticed this in the original PR as well, if multiple transactions are sent, the count keeps going up without a limit: \r\n\r\n```\r\n [privatebroadcast] Requested to open 60 connection(s), trying to open one\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreenshot below, I managed to capture a private broadcast connection! I'll mention when i get to that commit in review as well, but the connection type `\"privbcast\"` is breaking the very nice `-netinfo` table :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I have a few questions about the strategy:\r\n\r\n1. How do we pick the onion peers to relay to? If we avoid reusing peers then (especially in my miniature network) we can run out quickly, and nothing ever gets broadcast.\r\n\r\n2. Are we using fresh Tor identities for these connections? I think [Wasabi does something like this:](https://docs.wasabiwallet.app/why-wasabi/NetworkLevelPrivacy.html)\r\n\r\n> Wasabi connects to each peer through a different Tor stream. \r\n\r\n3. Do you think we need any RPC to get the status of private tx sends or provide the option to abandon (or revert to clearnet?)\r\n\r\n4. I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool? Do you think future work will integrate the wallet?\r\n\r\n\r\n![privbroadcast](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/2084648/ec172be1-e5d8-4c00-94fc-e219dccacdec)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
