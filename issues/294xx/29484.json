I guess we'll see if this blows up our c-i.~\r\nEdit: Ignore this. ajtowns pointed out that we're already using a few concepts.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in #13580. Please check my logic on this as I'm unable to test on a SmartOS system. Even better would be a confirmation from someone who can build there.",
