      "body" : "> What is your thinking on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29454 ?\r\n\r\nSame as said that for sibling evictions - Iâll go to hack a tx-relay jamming / pinning toolkit, that way weâll have more information on the robustness of those current proposed anti-pinning mitigations. I still maintain there are very incomplete for time-sensitive transaction flows, especially in face of âloopholeâ and NTA pinnings. Iâm incredibly worried for the security of the Lightning Network if we donât deploy additional anti-pinning mitigations on top of those ones over the future years - We have not seen yet script kiddies attacking the network. \r\n\r\nUnder today inertia, weâll probably converge towards a centralized network of ~50 LSPs relying on traditional social trust rather than relying on trust-minimized confirmation of pre-signed transactions. This is very problematic if they wish to accept channel traffic from low-resources spokes LN nodes, especially in geographical areas where social trust mechanism cannot be afforded by end-users.\r\n\r\nOn #29454, I still prefer to keep experimenting on âtransaction-issuer selected policy limitsâ which might encompass more stringent tx-relay jamming on a minor fork of Bitcoin Core. Coming up with a sound technical proposal in matters of tx-relay policy likely demands few rounds of iterations and realistically we already have a severe shortage of qualified review bandwidth in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe initial reason closing of #29448 was my own realization that the introduction of differentiated tx-relay policy among the tx-relay network of nodes will probably generate with time tiers of transaction economic traffic priority (I really cannot see how it worsens memory / CPU DoS robustness per se ?). I donât think this is a phenomena we can do a lot as a full-node implementation, as weâre seeing with the appearance of transaction accelerators by mining pools. There is transaction issuer demand for such services apparently. Yet we should be careful of doing works in parallel to maintain bip152 block propagation and as such long-term decentralization of the base-layer network.\r\n\r\nIâm not opposing the deployment of `TX_MAX_STANDARD_VERSION=3` in Bitcoin Core v28.0.",
