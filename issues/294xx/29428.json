   "body" : "The objective of this PR is to add some tests to the assumeUTXO logic.\r\n\r\nThe reason it is marked as Draft is because I am planning to add more (related) tests in the following days, but each commit you see in this PR CAN be reviewed now.\r\n\r\n(If the approach of grouping related test in a single PR is undesirable, let me know and I'll split them in independent PRs )\r\n\r\nThe first test (86037415dd83da34d829f2f6bfb8dcbe08968180 as of now ) checks that snapshots with less accumulated work than the node's active chain, should not be loaded and return with an error. Although in a different context of discussion the missing test was detect in a thread in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29394 (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29394#discussion_r1484122214)",
