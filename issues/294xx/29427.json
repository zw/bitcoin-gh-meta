If we want to go down this route, I can add tests and comments indicating that this behavior should be deprecated at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nSee #29319 for context, and I wrote up a summary of some statistics I gathered from analyzing data from 2023 [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/analysis-of-attempting-to-imbue-ln-commitment-transaction-spends-with-v3-semantics/527/1).",
