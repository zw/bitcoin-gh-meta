   "body" : "If requested, make the SOCKS5 Python proxy redirect connections to a set of given destinations. Actually act as a real proxy, connecting the client to a destination, except that the destination is not what the client asked for.\r\n\r\nThis would enable us to \"connect\" to Tor addresses from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nPlus a few other minor improvements in the test framework as individual commits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese changes are part of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415 but they make sense on their own and would be good to have them, regardless of the fate of #29415. Also, if this is merged, that would reduce the size of #29415, thus the current standalone PR.",
