If the child contains an input from our wallet, that input cannot be reused until the child is abandoned.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/pull/2818\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWe should try to detect if a such a child transaction becomes conflicted due to a parent becoming conflicted and mark it as such.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nA (failing) test for this behavior can be found at https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/commit/213fa91d5c289204e3f1e01194b1fccd08a69c6c\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@128b4a80387d322a7810d8716eccdac95ff9b8cd\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nArch\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
