See https://bitcoinops.org/en/payment-batching/. For example, if many recipients are paid in a large transaction, the fee may be higher than one of the recipients' amounts. If the payment creator is now forced to pay every recipient individually in a separate transaction, it will consume more block space overall and make the problem you are trying to solve worse. Also, while the fee on each separate transaction is less than the fee for the large batching transaction, the sum of all small fees is larger than the fee of the batch transaction.",

It's only a problem when the spam continues to jack up fees for no legit reason.  See here:  https://twitter.com/DoctorBuzz1/status/1757659895426330648\r\n\r\nEven in the current fee market, I think it would be tough to find a legit batch Tx that would be triggered by this change, considering the savings mentioned in your link.  And even if you COULD find an example, there's always the ability to find an appropriate ratio as was done with Segwit.  My initial thought was...\r\n\r\n`if (3Tx < TxFee) {isDust = True;}`\r\n\r\nWhich seems too generous, IMHO, but starting at _some_ legit level of consensus is obviously better than ignoring what is preventing the adoption of \"freedom money\" to be actually used as money.  Rijndael admitted that Central Bankers aren't afraid of Bitcoin's use as a store of value, but they would be threatened if it could actually be used for coffee payments.  Less people are willing to run a node with a consistently high fee environment, like the past year (I know I was looking to start a LN routing node in Feb of last year and scrapped the idea until there was a solution, but there has been none accepted, even tho solutions do exist).\r\n\r\nCan we agree that the laser eyed focus was for Bitcoin to be used as money and not file storage for PooCoins?  If decisions are going to be made on what's in the best short-term interest of miners, then let's at least rate limit this crap in the long-term interest and value of Bitcoin.",

So since a P2WPKH UTXO is at least 67 vB, if it's created by a 100 sat/vB transaction, without using a multiplier it would be considered dust below 6700 sats.\r\n\r\nThis could (and probably would) still cause issues for things like anchor outputs, but it might be possible to fine-tune the rules to allow for smaller dust outputs in conjunction with larger outputs specifically. Not that I would be sad to see anchor outputs disappear in favor of something that isn't based on clogging up the blockchain with CPFPs...",
