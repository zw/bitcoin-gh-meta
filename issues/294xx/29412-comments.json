What are the known forms of mutated blocks?\r\n\r\nLooking at `IsBlockMutated` in this PR should provide the answers for these questions, but to recap:\r\n\r\n* When we receive a block it contains a header and a list of transactions. The header contains a merkle root hash (`CBlock::hashMerkleRoot`) which should commit to the list of transactions but [if it doesn't the block is considered mutated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b2b2b1e9e415c3b5f74d517eaebfc2073cef5175/src/validation.cpp#L3660-L3671).\r\n* The coinbase transaction (post segwit) contains a commitment (very similar to the merkle root in the header) to the witness data in a block. [If that commitment does not actually commit to the witnesses that were received, the block is considered mutated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b2b2b1e9e415c3b5f74d517eaebfc2073cef5175/src/validation.cpp#L3861-L3896).\r\n* Our merkle root algorithm has several flaws which allow for further malleation, see [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf) for a great overview.",

Compact blocks are relayed before full validation occurs, therefore we don't punish peers for sending us invalid blocks through compact block relay. Block mutation might also occur randomly during compact bock relay due to short-id collisions, which is another reason not to punish.",
