What are the known forms of mutated blocks?\r\n\r\nLooking at `IsBlockMutated` in this PR should provide the answers for these questions, but to recap:\r\n\r\n* When we receive a block it contains a header and a list of transactions. The header contains a merkle root hash (`CBlock::hashMerkleRoot`) which should commit to the list of transactions but [if it doesn't the block is considered mutated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b2b2b1e9e415c3b5f74d517eaebfc2073cef5175/src/validation.cpp#L3660-L3671).\r\n* The coinbase transaction (post segwit) contains a commitment (very similar to the merkle root in the header) to the witness data in a block. [If that commitment does not actually commit to the witnesses that were received, the block is considered mutated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b2b2b1e9e415c3b5f74d517eaebfc2073cef5175/src/validation.cpp#L3861-L3896).\r\n* Our merkle root algorithm has several flaws which allow for further malleation, see [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf) for a great overview.",

Compact blocks are relayed before full validation occurs, therefore we don't punish peers for sending us invalid blocks through compact block relay. Block mutation might also occur randomly during compact bock relay due to short-id collisions, which is another reason not to punish.",

But it is actually really cheap to produce mutated blocks if you have a fully valid one (e.g. by adding one transaction to the block), so logging under the category is better.\r\n\r\nI agree that we don't want to log **all** mutated blocks we receive. I'm specifically talking about logging valid-PoW, but mutated blocks with header hashes that we haven't seen before. These are expensive to produce. I think @instagibbs's interpretation of my comment is correct.\r\n\r\nAs an example: Currently, there is a mining pool that broadcasts newly found, mutated blocks due to a bug in their mining pool software. Their (Bitcoin Core) nodes also relay these blocks as compact blocks. Before this PR, we'd log the following to the debug.log when we received the mutated block directly from the pool's broken P2P clients before we received it as a compact block. When we received the compact block first, we didn't process the mutated blocks from the pool broken P2P client as we were already aware of the non-mutated block. With this PR, we don't log anything about mutated blocks by default. To be able to detect cases like these, it might be worth having something like this (untested): https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/commit/54922dacb4aa066bf9bcbfbbad4e5d16420d5b6e\r\n\r\n```\r\n# debug.log on receiving a mutated block before this PR\r\nERROR: AcceptBlock: bad-witness-nonce-size, ContextualCheckBlock : invalid witness reserved value size\r\nERROR: ProcessNewBlock: AcceptBlock FAILED (bad-witness-nonce-size, ContextualCheckBlock : invalid witness reserved value size)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n",
