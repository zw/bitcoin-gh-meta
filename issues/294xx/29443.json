   "body" : "Compiling C++ code with `-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600` causes problems on OpenBSD. If that define is set, the C++ standard header detection routine in BDB's configure script fails due to a missing type name for `locale_t` (see https://gist.github.com/theStack/b41884e31ebc5cdca3220bcaa674cb70 for the relevant config.log part).\r\n\r\nThis results in `HAVE_CXX_STDHEADERS` not being defined, which then it turn leads to the inclusion of `<iostream.h>` (rather than `<iostream>`), which doesn't exist, as described in #28963.\r\n\r\nAccording to a mailing list post discussing a similar problem [1], \"OpenBSD provides the POSIX APIs by default\", so we don't need this define anyway and can remove it. This fixes the BDB build problem as described in issue #28963. See also https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/pull/6205/commits/f87e75ae71a2301daf2ad59b180977fc30c6abe4 for a similar fix for google's flatbuffer project.\r\n\r\nTested on OpenBSD 7.4 with clang 13.0.0. Fixes #28963.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.mail-archive.com/tech@openbsd.org/msg63386.html",
