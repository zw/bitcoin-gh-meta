   "body" : "Add tests for the following v2 handshake scenarios:\r\n1. Disconnection happens when > `MAX_GARBAGE_LEN` bytes garbage is sent\r\n2. Disconnection happens when incorrect garbage terminator is sent\r\n3. Disconnection happens when garbage bytes are tampered with\r\n4. Disconnection happens when AAD of first encrypted packet after the garbage terminator is not filled\r\n5. bitcoind ignores non-empty version packet and no disconnection happens\r\n\r\nAll these tests require a modified v2 P2P class (different from `EncryptedP2PState` used in `v2_p2p.py`) to implement our custom handshake behaviour based on different scenarios and have been kept in a single test file (`test/functional/p2p_v2_misbehaving.py`). Shifted the test in `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py` which is of the same pattern to this file too.",
