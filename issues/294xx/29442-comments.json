      "body" : "@murchandamus we'd love to get your feedback on this! I'll try to summarize at a higher level what we'd like to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe `bitcoind` wallet currently tries to keep a somewhat \"minimal\" utxo set and actively consolidates user utxos, because it assumes that we receive transactions as much (or more) than we send transactions and wants outgoing transactions to be as cheap as possible. But that's not true of liquidity service providers, who usually only receive funds when refilling the wallet from cold storage, and want to make sure they always have enough confirmed utxos to satisfy user demand efficiently. In such cases, the wallet operator has a good idea of what they'd like their utxo pool to look like (because they're selling a limited sets of specific amounts), and would like `bitcoind` to try to maintain that utxo pool as much as possible, while optimizing mostly for transaction weight, especially when feerate is high (above a user-defined threshold, similar to `consolidatefeerate` but with the exact opposite semantics - when below that threshold, we want to actively _create_ more utxos, not _consolidate_ them).\r\n\r\nWe can think of this type of wallet as a slowly draining wallet: its total amount is linearly decreasing over time, and is occasionally topped-up from cold storage.\r\n\r\nWe're not sure how to best achieve that. Our goal is to do it inside `bitcoind` (which is the source of truth for the wallet state), but with minimal changes to the coin selection code itself. We'd like this to be as much as possible done by simply pre-processing inputs to the coin selection algorithms and post-processing their outputs, which would make this:\r\n\r\n- easy to rebase on top of bitcoind releases if this work doesn't make sense to be accepted into `bitcoind`\r\n- or as a user-configurable option if that PR can be merged to `bitcoind`",
