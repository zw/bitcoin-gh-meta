      "body" : "@murchandamus we'd love to get your feedback on this! I'll try to summarize at a higher level what we'd like to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe `bitcoind` wallet currently tries to keep a somewhat \"minimal\" utxo set and actively consolidates user utxos, because it assumes that we receive transactions as much (or more) than we send transactions and wants outgoing transactions to be as cheap as possible. But that's not true of liquidity service providers, who usually only receive funds when refilling the wallet from cold storage, and want to make sure they always have enough confirmed utxos to satisfy user demand efficiently. In such cases, the wallet operator has a good idea of what they'd like their utxo pool to look like (because they're selling a limited sets of specific amounts), and would like `bitcoind` to try to maintain that utxo pool as much as possible, while optimizing mostly for transaction weight, especially when feerate is high (above a user-defined threshold, similar to `consolidatefeerate` but with the exact opposite semantics - when below that threshold, we want to actively _create_ more utxos, not _consolidate_ them).\r\n\r\nWe can think of this type of wallet as a slowly draining wallet: its total amount is linearly decreasing over time, and is occasionally topped-up from cold storage.\r\n\r\nWe're not sure how to best achieve that. Our goal is to do it inside `bitcoind` (which is the source of truth for the wallet state), but with minimal changes to the coin selection code itself. We'd like this to be as much as possible done by simply pre-processing inputs to the coin selection algorithms and post-processing their outputs, which would make this:\r\n\r\n- easy to rebase on top of bitcoind releases if this work doesn't make sense to be accepted into `bitcoind`\r\n- or as a user-configurable option if that PR can be merged to `bitcoind`",

      "body" : "I'm not sure this is really what we want. I think this function should try to refill multiple buckets at once (when amounts allow it), not just the most depleted one:\r\n\r\n- Check which utxo buckets should be refilled:\r\n  - Initialize a `to_refill` list of `(bucket, target_quantity)`\r\n  - For each utxo bucket:\r\n    - If the feerate is low (below a to-be-defined threshold) and the bucket is less than 70% full (or a to-be-defined threshold that could be configurable):\r\n      - Add this bucket to `to_refill` with a `target_quantity` of `target_utxo_count - current_utxo_count` (when feerate is low, we'd like to refill as much as possible)\r\n    - If the feerate is higher than our threshold and the bucket is less than 30% full (or a to-be-defined threshold that could be configurable), we refill less aggressively:\r\n      - Add this bucket to `to_refill` with a `target_quantity` that we scale (somehow) based on feerate and how many utxos we're missing\r\n  - Order `to_refill` by `target_quantity`, descending (we'll want to refill the buckets that are missing the most utxos first)\r\n- Check the utxos that we have outside of our buckets: we ideally want to spend those utxos to refill our buckets. We have no guarantee that those are the ones that will be used by the coin selection, but we can use their total amount as the maximum amount of funds we allocate to refill our buckets. This part is a bit fuzzy for me right now, I'm not sure this is the best approach, it definitely deserves more thoughts.\r\n  - Iterate over those utxos and add their amount to obtain `utxos_outside_buckets_total_amount`\r\n- Compute the change target based on `to_refill` and `utxos_outside_buckets_total_amount`:\r\n  - Initialize `change_target` to `0`\r\n  - Iterate over `to_refill`, and for each bucket that needs to be refilled:\r\n    - Decide how much of the `target_quantity` we want to refill based on `utxos_outside_buckets_total_amount` and the current `change_target`\r\n    - Add the corresponding amount to `change_target`\r\n    - That step probably has a lot of issues as well and deserves more thought. If we have a lot of utxos outside of our buckets, we may end up targeting a very large change amount and thus create a huge transaction, which is generally undesirable, but maybe desirable when our buckets are close to being empty. Maybe it makes sense to bound the `change_target` to a (small) multiplier of the funding amount? Or have a very different behavior when the feerate is very low, because when that happens we may want to fully refill our buckets?\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this is still very early discussion on what the algorithm should look like. It feels like we're still trying to understand the pitfalls we want to avoid we should try to write the algorithm in pseudo-code first in order to converge on an initial version (maybe to be detailed and discussed in a delving bitcoin post).\r\n\r\nAlso, when we don't want to actively refill buckets, we should target a changeless transaction, I'm not sure that is done right now?",

It feels like adding randomization may be the simple way to avoid this? But maybe it's too early in the algorithm design phase to decide.",
