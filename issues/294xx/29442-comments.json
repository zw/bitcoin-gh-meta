      "body" : "@murchandamus we'd love to get your feedback on this! I'll try to summarize at a higher level what we'd like to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe `bitcoind` wallet currently tries to keep a somewhat \"minimal\" utxo set and actively consolidates user utxos, because it assumes that we receive transactions as much (or more) than we send transactions and wants outgoing transactions to be as cheap as possible. But that's not true of liquidity service providers, who usually only receive funds when refilling the wallet from cold storage, and want to make sure they always have enough confirmed utxos to satisfy user demand efficiently. In such cases, the wallet operator has a good idea of what they'd like their utxo pool to look like (because they're selling a limited sets of specific amounts), and would like `bitcoind` to try to maintain that utxo pool as much as possible, while optimizing mostly for transaction weight, especially when feerate is high (above a user-defined threshold, similar to `consolidatefeerate` but with the exact opposite semantics - when below that threshold, we want to actively _create_ more utxos, not _consolidate_ them).\r\n\r\nWe can think of this type of wallet as a slowly draining wallet: its total amount is linearly decreasing over time, and is occasionally topped-up from cold storage.\r\n\r\nWe're not sure how to best achieve that. Our goal is to do it inside `bitcoind` (which is the source of truth for the wallet state), but with minimal changes to the coin selection code itself. We'd like this to be as much as possible done by simply pre-processing inputs to the coin selection algorithms and post-processing their outputs, which would make this:\r\n\r\n- easy to rebase on top of bitcoind releases if this work doesn't make sense to be accepted into `bitcoind`\r\n- or as a user-configurable option if that PR can be merged to `bitcoind`",

      "body" : "I'm not sure this is really what we want. I think this function should try to refill multiple buckets at once (when amounts allow it), not just the most depleted one:\r\n\r\n- Check which utxo buckets should be refilled:\r\n  - Initialize a `to_refill` list of `(bucket, target_quantity)`\r\n  - For each utxo bucket:\r\n    - If the feerate is low (below a to-be-defined threshold) and the bucket is less than 70% full (or a to-be-defined threshold that could be configurable):\r\n      - Add this bucket to `to_refill` with a `target_quantity` of `target_utxo_count - current_utxo_count` (when feerate is low, we'd like to refill as much as possible)\r\n    - If the feerate is higher than our threshold and the bucket is less than 30% full (or a to-be-defined threshold that could be configurable), we refill less aggressively:\r\n      - Add this bucket to `to_refill` with a `target_quantity` that we scale (somehow) based on feerate and how many utxos we're missing\r\n  - Order `to_refill` by `target_quantity`, descending (we'll want to refill the buckets that are missing the most utxos first)\r\n- Check the utxos that we have outside of our buckets: we ideally want to spend those utxos to refill our buckets. We have no guarantee that those are the ones that will be used by the coin selection, but we can use their total amount as the maximum amount of funds we allocate to refill our buckets. This part is a bit fuzzy for me right now, I'm not sure this is the best approach, it definitely deserves more thoughts.\r\n  - Iterate over those utxos and add their amount to obtain `utxos_outside_buckets_total_amount`\r\n- Compute the change target based on `to_refill` and `utxos_outside_buckets_total_amount`:\r\n  - Initialize `change_target` to `0`\r\n  - Iterate over `to_refill`, and for each bucket that needs to be refilled:\r\n    - Decide how much of the `target_quantity` we want to refill based on `utxos_outside_buckets_total_amount` and the current `change_target`\r\n    - Add the corresponding amount to `change_target`\r\n    - That step probably has a lot of issues as well and deserves more thought. If we have a lot of utxos outside of our buckets, we may end up targeting a very large change amount and thus create a huge transaction, which is generally undesirable, but maybe desirable when our buckets are close to being empty. Maybe it makes sense to bound the `change_target` to a (small) multiplier of the funding amount? Or have a very different behavior when the feerate is very low, because when that happens we may want to fully refill our buckets?\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this is still very early discussion on what the algorithm should look like. It feels like we're still trying to understand the pitfalls we want to avoid we should try to write the algorithm in pseudo-code first in order to converge on an initial version (maybe to be detailed and discussed in a delving bitcoin post).\r\n\r\nAlso, when we don't want to actively refill buckets, we should target a changeless transaction, I'm not sure that is done right now?",

Some of them may not be well suited for that?\r\n\r\nYes, I think we should only run BnB and Coingrinder. Currently SRD and Knapsack are fallbacks that could win when BnB and CoinGrinder have higher waste metrics. When `consolidatefeerate=0` then `longTermFeeRate=0` and the waste metric used to compare the results of the different algorithms should be based on how much we overshoot the target value + how much it costs to add more inputs.\r\n```c\r\nwaste = selectionTotal - target + inputs Ã (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\r\n```\r\nIf one of the algorithms can find a solution with less overshoot than the cost of adding more (small value) inputs, then it seems like they would win. Coingrinder should always find a solution with the least input weight. \r\n\r\nWhen fees are high, I think we should not care if we overshoot our target. We should always prefer a changeless BnB solution over one with change. When we have to produce change, we would prefer the Coingrinder solution with minimal input weight. We will allocate change to outputs sized to favor BnB in the future.\r\n\r\nWhen fees are low, I think we will want to create more change to refill our target buckets, but still not favor more exact matches that use more inputs.",

I also think a static file could describe the buckets in a way that better adapts to a changing fee environment.\r\n\r\nFor example, rather than `start_satoshis` and `end_satoshi` we could define a bucket as:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        \"confirmation_target\": 6,\r\n        \"fee_rate_std\": 10000, \r\n        \"buckets\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"target_satoshis\": 10000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 150\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe range of values you want to spend should be \"target_satoshis\" + the fee to spend that input at a fee rate that will confirm in \"confirmation_target\" blocks. Because free rates vary, we randomize the current fee rate within a range +/- \"fee_rate_std\".\r\n\r\nTo refill a bucket, compute the `target_output` as:\r\n```\r\ntarget_feerate = current_feerate(\"confirmation_target\") + random(-1 * \"fee_rate_std\", \"fee_rate_std\")\r\ntarget_output = \"target_satoshis\" + size_of_input * target_feerate \r\n``` \r\nIdeally we would only need to restart when we add/remove buckets, change their counts or when fee variance changes dramatically.\r\n",

      "body" : "I think it is unavoidable that refilling buckets cannibalizes utxos from other buckets unless there is a pool of utxos larger than the largest target bucket to pick from. The goal though is that in the long run the system wastes as little value from fees and over payment as possible in aggregate.\r\n\r\nThis is how I think the process as implemented currently ([85a049d](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29442/commits/85a049ddceb854106efea8316462e356d9b88b21)) should work: \r\n\r\nBecause we always set our minimum change value to be *at least* as large as one of our target buckets that is depleted,  all of the wallet utxos are either in the range of one of our target buckets or larger than one of our target buckets.\r\n\r\nA changeless BnB solution is found when:\r\n1) there is a single utxo in the corresponding target bucket that does not overpay by too much in fees\r\n2) a combination of multiple utxos smaller than the target bucket exist that do not overpay by too much in fees\r\n\r\nA CoinGrinder solution is preferred when the cost of fees and over payment of the best BnB solution is more than the fees from using:\r\n1) a single larger utxo with change outputs \r\n2) a combination of multiple smaller utxos and change outputs\r\n\r\nThe largest wallet utxo will hold the residual value after initially refilling the buckets from cold storage. This residual funding utxo will be used as a single input when:\r\n1) this utxo is available and CoinGrinder selects it to refill buckets opportunistically \r\n2) fees are low, or buckets are severely depleted, we force this input to be selected to refill buckets. \r\n\r\nWhen a large residual value utxo is used to refill all buckets via change outputs, another large residual utxo may also be created. That residual value utxo can not be used again until the tx that uses it confirms. This seems like an area that can be optimized. Perhaps a separate automatic refill transaction that confirms quickly makes more sense than using it for opportunistic bucket refills.\r\n\r\nEventually the largest utxo in the wallet will be in the range of the target buckets. The utxo set will then no longer be able to refill buckets without also depleting other buckets. This should be a signal to refill the wallet from cold storage.",

They have different and conflicting needs. So we either will have to have a complicated code and configuration surface to reconcile them or make our code extendable. \r\n\r\nThe interface of coin selection is pretty well defined, so it seems like it is a good fit for extensibility. The coin selection plug-in could receive utxo_pool and target amount as inputs (plus maybe some additional info), and return selected utxo's as result. @remyers @t-bast would something like this work in your case?",
