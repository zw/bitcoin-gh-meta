I know no test and CI failing, itâs just proof-of-concept code to test how it would fit in a package world.\r\n\r\nE.g for LN, you could adjust your pinning / dust inflation risk exposure in function of each of your lightning peer, as an element negotiated as part of the funding flow.\r\n\r\n> There seems to be a large number of goals and issues that aren't clearly defined. Would you mind writing something a bit clearer and more concise?\r\n\r\nI thought more about it. That approach is currently too much ambitious and not conservative enough. I'll do a write-up.",
