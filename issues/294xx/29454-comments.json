      "body" : "The problem with policy limits is they're all based on asking miners to ignore transactions that are potentially profitable. This is similar in spirit to opt-in RBF. And as we've seen, the supermajority of hash power eventually decided to ignore the opt-in flag and just do RBF all the time. If push came to shove, it wouldn't be surprising to run into the same class of problem with policy limits.\r\n\r\nMuch better to focus on solutions like replace-by-fee-rate that rely on better aligning miner incentives with the protocols in question. These solutions also appear to be much simpler.\r\n\r\nFinally, using the taproot annex specifically has the problem that you're using extra bytes. As always, that's a miner centralization concern because cheaper solutions are possible that do not use the annex.",
