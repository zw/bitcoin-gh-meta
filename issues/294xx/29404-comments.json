The files are never compiled and linked when the flag isn't set, so making them appear \"empty\" when the flag isn't set is not needed?\r\n\r\nYeah, I agree. If there's some historical reason for this, I've forgotten it. It makes sense to me to make it either optionally compiled or optionally opted in (or out) via a define, but I don't see the need for both.\r\n\r\nI do seem to remember some tools (`ar` or `ld`) that didn't like dealing with an empty file. So maybe it started as being unconditionally compiled with an ifdef to control, and became additionally guarded at the buildsystem level on top to account for those tools?",
