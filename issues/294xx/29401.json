Ref: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29400, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29399, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29363, fa3886b7c69cbbe564478f30bb2c35e9e6b1cffa, ...\r\n\r\nFix all issues by using the built-in `int` helpers `to_bytes` via a scripted diff.\r\n\r\nReview notes:\r\n\r\n* For `struct.pack` and `int.to_bytes` the error behavior is the same, although the error messages are not identical.\r\n* Two `struct.pack` remain. One for float serialization in a C++ code comment, and one for native serialization.\r\n\r\n",
