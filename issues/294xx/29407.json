The value wasn't forwarded to libsecp as a user might have reasonably expected.\r\n3. We now have the DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 define which is what disable-asm actually did in practice.\r\n\r\nIf there is any desire, we can hook DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 up to a new configure option that actually does what it says.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this is one of the last (THE last?) remaining uses of autoconf defines in our crypto code. As such it seems like low-hanging fruit.",
