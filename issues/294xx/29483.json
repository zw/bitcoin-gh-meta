   "body" : "This suggests a strategy to run the functional tests with both v1 and v2 transport in the CI.\r\n\r\n**Status Quo:**\r\nThere is both the global `--v2transport` option for the `test_runner.py` (not enabled by default), plus the possibility to specify `--v2transport` for particular tests, which is used for a handful of tests. Currently, when running `test_runner.py --v2transport`, these tests are run twice with the same `--v2transport` configuration, as has been noted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29358#discussion_r1485626063, which is wasteful.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Change:**\r\nFix this by adding a `--v1transport` option and using it in `test_runner.py`, so that irrespective of the global `--v2transport` flag, the  tests that run twice use v1 in one run and v2 in the other.\r\nAlso add `--v2transport` to one CI task (`multiprocess, i686, DEBUG`).\r\nThis means, that for each CI task, the majority of functional tests will run once using the global `--v2transport` option if provided, while a few selected tests will always run two times, once with `v1` and once with `v2`.\r\n\r\n**Rationale:**\r\nA simpler alternative would have been to remove all test-specific `--v2transport` commands from `test_runner.py` and just enable `--v2transport` option for a few CI tasks. I didn't do that because it would have meant that v2 would never be running in the CI for some platforms, and also be run a lot less locally by users and devs (who would have to actively enable the `--v2transport` option).
