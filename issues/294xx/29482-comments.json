It would be nice to log or show a warning in this case.\r\n\r\nI think current behavior of treating it like an error is also reasonable, too.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about about the new bug reported in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/567#issuecomment-1962422185 since it is i just a screenshot without steps to reproduce. If that bug is happening without anything specified on the command line or in bitcoin.conf like the original bug https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/567 then that is a real unexpected problem and bug.",
