Such testing could benefit from a assume utxo snapshot, saving everyone the pain of rewinding. I can bake one, though ideally I'd like #26045 to land first.\r\n\r\nIs the current PR already using batches? It's unclear to me by glancing over `validation.cpp` if and how it's collecting up to `max_batch_size{106}` signatures before calling `batch.Verify()`.\r\n\r\nMaybe add a `-schnorrbatchverify` startup argument so more people can try it once it gets through review.",
