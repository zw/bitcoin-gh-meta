The issue description doesn't seem to say whether or not the parent transaction is in the mempool, but maybe that's implied.\r\n\r\nMaybe one complication with using the TransactionRemovedFromMempool notification to detect block conflicts is that the notification doesn't include the hash of the conflicting block. But maybe this information could be added, or we could add back the vtxConflicted array argument to BlockConnected that was removed in #17477. I think recording the hash of the conflicting block is just mostly just important for reverting the conflicted state if there is a reorg.",
