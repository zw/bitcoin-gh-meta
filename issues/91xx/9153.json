Now my bitcoin are in the electrum wallet  installed on my PC and I do not have the password and e seed. \r\nhow can I recover  the bitcoins?    people say that those bitcoin are lost but I can't belive it....they are in my wallet installed in my pc.......\r\nCan you help me please.......?\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you in advance\r\n\r\n",
