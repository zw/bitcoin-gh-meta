Not only this, but many of the cmpctblocks arrive quite a while after I have received the block from other nodes, so surely my node should be requesting the announcement via cmpctblocks stops, or disconnecting the nodes that continue to announce via cmpctblocks after they've been requested not to.\r\n\r\nAs a bolt-on question: why is the contents of every cmpctblock received different?",
