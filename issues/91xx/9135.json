   "body" : "### Issue\r\n\r\nWallet rescan progress indicator in debug.log is not intuitive. For example, 0.953423 doesn't mean 95% done.\r\nThis isn't a big issue for me, but I want to report it because it may save the next person some time (unnecessary wait).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Import privkey with rescan \r\n2. Tail the log\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI would expect that  `Progress=0.980699` means I'm 98% done.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nOn testnet (obviously) I'm 0.98 complete (is that 98% complete?) rescanning block 576517, whereas currently ` height=1032846` or so.\r\n`2016-11-11 20:50:02 Still rescanning. At block 576517. Progress=0.980699`\r\nIt's not done yet (2+ hours now), but I hope progress won't end up being greater than 1, because that would be even more confusing.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.12.1 with addrindex patch ([source](https://github.com/btcdrak/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.12.1-addrindex))\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- CPU:  ARMv8\r\n- RAM: 1GB\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): SSD\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nHere's couple of sections from my debug.log. At block 53K it's already 0.17 done (wonderful) so instead of killing the daemon and retrying with no rescan, I decide to wait. Encouraged by the fast progress I keep waiting... and waiting. If I knew 0.17 doesn't really mean \"17% done\" I would have saved myself few hours of wait.\r\n```\r\n2016-11-11 19:24:49 Still rescanning. At block 53404.
