      "body" : "Had similar thoughts that using muhash instead would be nice in order to avoid the chain rollback for AssumeUTXO hash reviewers. Not sure if this is a huge problem, but one funny side-effect of this would be that for a chainstate with _n_ coins, there are in theory _n!_ different serializations possible that all would pass as valid (compared to just one for `hash_serialized_2`), since the order of coins doesn't matter for muhash. \r\n\r\n> For good measure we should also modify `gettxoutsetinfo` so it can calculate the muhash for the current UTXO set without relying on the index. This would help users with pruned nodes (and without the index) to verify a newly proposed snapshot (if they haven't pruned beyond it).\r\n\r\nI think calculating the muhash of the current chainstate without relying on coinstatsindex is already possible today by omitting the `hash_or_height` parameter, i.e. simply `gettxoutsetinfo muhash`? (If you want to try it out, I recommend passing `-rpcclienttimeout=0`, as the calculation takes quite long and could RPC-timeout with the default setting).",

The end user of the snapshot would benefit from a sha256 hash in order to not waste time verifying incorrect snapshots (assuming that sha256 is quicker than muhash here).\r\n\r\nA file checksum doesn't need to be in the consensus code, though if we offer an automatic download it may need to be somewhere in the code. The right file checksum may depend on the specific distribution mechanism, e.g. if you use a torrent you'd use the torrent hash, not the .dat file hash.\r\n\r\nOnly committing to the muhash in the consensus code also leaves the door open for some fancy download scheme that takes advantage of the fact that ordering and duplicates don't matter. \r\n\r\n> I think calculating the muhash of the current chainstate without relying on coinstatsindex is already possible today\r\n\r\nYou're right, scrapping that.",
