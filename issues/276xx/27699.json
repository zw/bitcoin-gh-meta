For reference, the current\r\noldest maintained kernel is `4.14` (released 2017, going EOL Jan 2024).\r\n\r\nSupport for `getrandom()` (and `getentropy()`) was added to\r\nglibc `2.25` https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2017-02/msg00079.html:\r\n> * The getentropy and getrandom functions, and the <sys/random.h> header\r\n  file have been added.\r\n\r\nand we already require `2.27` or later.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I don't think you would encounter a current day (+~6 months from now)\r\nsystem, running with kernel headers older than 3.17 (released 2014) but also having a\r\nglibc of 2.27+ (released 2018)?\r\n\r\nRemoving this (our only) use of `syscall()` also means we can drop a workaround in our MSAN jobs.\r\nIf this is merged, I'll drop the [same workaround in oss-fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/25946a544856413d31d9cbb3a366a4aef5a8fd60/projects/bitcoin-core/build.sh#L49-L56).",
