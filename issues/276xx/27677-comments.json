Here's the transcript of the above mentioned presentation: https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-04-25-mempool-clustering/\r\n\r\n It's also worth noting that although this proposal introduces a new limit, for the cluster size, it could potentially supersede some other limits (e.g. `-limitancestorcount`, `-limitancestorsize`, `-limitdescendantcount`, `-limitdescendantsize`) if the maximum cluster size is large enough. Though if the limit is in vbytes, then someone assuming a limit in count might still hit a non backwards compatible policy limit.",

      "body" : "Thanks for sharing all those details, this is great!\r\nI can only comment as someone who relies a lot on mempool/transaction relay for lightning: my opinion may thus be biased.\r\nI believe that lightning's security will *always* depend on the ability to get specific transactions confirmed before a given block, so anything that can help transaction propagation is important for us (and I believe this will be true for most L2 contracts).\r\n\r\n> Philosophically, is it problematic for RBF rules to be even more of a \"black box\" than the BIP 125 algorithm?\r\n\r\nIt isn't for me, as long as we can *somehow* RBF once we're ready to pay the price.\r\nThe way lightning implementations currently RBF is via trial-and-error, not by trying to abide by the BIP 125 rules.\r\nWe simply lower the change output of the transaction we're trying to RBF and/or add another input, try broadcasting, and try again with more fees if `bitcoind` rejects it (or if we still don't see our transaction confirming).\r\nSo we're already treating RBF as a black box, and don't care about making it \"more\" of a black box.\r\n\r\n> Are there usage patterns for wallets or other protocols that would be fundamentally harmed by cluster size limits? Do we know what values would be acceptable or what values would be insufficient?\r\n\r\nMost L2 contracts will only start once the \"contract transaction\" (channel funding transaction in the lightning case) is confirmed.\r\nIn the lightning case, the cluster we generate currently consists of:\r\n\r\n- a commitment transaction (no unconfirmed ancestors)\r\n- a CPFP child for that commitment transaction (which may bring its set of unconfirmed ancestors)\r\n\r\nThe commitment transaction may be as large as `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`, so we want the cluster size to allow that (but it's obvious that the limit needs to be higher than that anyway). Since L2 contracts generate trees of transactions, I believe they should always be able to get away with confirming each level of that tree independently, which means they only ever need one transaction and one CPFP child, nothing more (but we can probably make those contracts more fee-efficient if the cluster size allows more than that). @instagibbs does that fundamentally change with Eltoo? I guess not.\r\n\r\nThe CPFP child brings its own cluster with it, so the larger the cluster size limit is, the more of our utxos we're able to use to create our CPFP transaction. The limits chosen here will have to be arbitrary, and wallets will simply have to make sure their utxos confirm to be able to use them for CPFP. This is already the case because of the descendant limits, so it shouldn't be fundamentally more harmful?\r\n",

A cluster with 1 transaction is always optimally ordered (because only one order exists). The bigger a cluster (in number of transactions) is, the harder it is to find the optimal ordering. Up to 15-20 transactions we may be able to find it using an exponential-time algorithm; above that we need to either just use the ancestor-feerate based order, or some heuristical algorithm that may approach optimality.",

This would have the benefit of not making block construction any less efficient (due to the knapsack problem that occurs as we approach the end of a block).\r\n\r\n> The limits chosen here will have to be arbitrary, and wallets will simply have to make sure their utxos confirm to be able to use them for CPFP.

If indeed the only concern with a lot of evictions is due to the number of clusters that would need to be re-sorted, then we could either have the limit be a maximum number of **direct** conflicts (since indirect conflicts are always in the same cluster as one of the direct conflicts), or we could just have the limit explicitly be in terms of the number of **clusters** that would be affected, rather than the number of transactions that are in conflict.  \r\n\r\nRight now I'm imagining that the descendant limits (on count and vbytes) would go away entirely.  I tend to think that we should continue to enforce that no transaction have more than 101kvb of size-with-ancestors (either explicitly, or as a consequence of a maximum cluster size if that gets set to the same value).  It's unclear to me whether we should retain the ancestor count limit, because I think it might have an impact on the runtime of the ancestor-feerate-based linearization algorithm that I suspect will be part of the initial implementation, so this will be something to revisit in the future.",

      "body" : "From my understanding of the proposal, there is an intuition of aligning mining (i.e the maximum fees in a block template)\r\nand transactions evicted from our local mempools. The proposed changes goals would be to make the transactions that would be the last ones selected by our mining algorithm, the first ones to be removed from the mempool based e.g on an ancestor-feerate-based mining algorithm.\r\n\r\nWhile this symmetrization of block template construction and mempool eviction should work in light of today mining algorithms, I don't know if this will bind in considerations of other changes in the ecosystem. In the past, there have been [discussion](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-February/019846.html) on the mailing list if our RBF algorithm was the most income-maximising in face of different transactions traffic. Namely, high-feerate evictated/replaced chunks of transactions could be kept in a buffer of transactions ordered by their last descendants outputs. When a new package comes in, in case of missing parents outputs, a lookup is realized in the buffer to see if the package attached to evicted/replaced chunks ancestor-feerate is above the cluster spending the same utxo or above the bottom mempool chunks.\r\n\r\nWhile this type of broadcast pattern can seem odd today, as new chunks should have been broadcast by the same transaction issuer, and therefore the fee bidding monotonically increasing, this assumption might not be true with more deployment of multi-party applications or contracting protocols, where counterparties are competing for the spend of utxos with packages offering different absolutes fees/feerates (e.g Lightning commitment transactions). Further, you might have\r\nnew flows where the first component of the package is shared (e.g a [dual-funding/splicing](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/splicing/) between N parties) though where each party attaches a different CPFP due to asymmetries in liquidity preferences.\r\n\r\nBased on cluster pattern analysis, future mining algorithms might attach a prediction weight to each chunk part of the\r\nevicted/replaced chunks and decide which to keep in the space-limited buffer in case of eviction needed there too. Note,\r\nwhile the issue can be alleviated by bumping the size of both your mempool and hypothetical future replacement buffers\r\n(i.e `-maxmempool`), there will still be a need to efficiently traverse them, as you need to provide one block template to your mining devices due to the probabilistic nature of mining.\r\n\r\nSo do we have a separation of concerns between the proposed total ordering and a future hypothetical replacement cache\r\noptimizing block template construction, or turning the question differently is the proposed total ordering approach going\r\nto work well for mining algorithms optimizations buffering replaced transactions ?\r\n\r\nThere is a second line of thinking about this proposal, namely the workload in term of CPU cycles and what is the worst-case\r\nworkload we're designing for in term of incoming transaction-relay traffic. I think the main risk we're aiming to hedge against\r\nis huge payload of transactions being injected on a miner mempool forcing computationally-expensive replacement or eviction traversals on the clusters and therefore delaying the construction of a block template, a latency sensitive operation in the mining arm race.\r\n\r\nI think we're certaintly bounded on the transaction-relay download limits here, i.e `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS`,\r\n`MAX_PEER_TX_REQUEST_IN_FLIGHT` and the default number of transaction-relay peers (though we can probably reason by reduction to a single peer for the purpose of DoS analysis) and should we adopt them for the worst-case perfomance\r\nanalysis of all the mempool operations ? \r\n\r\nBeyond transaction-relay performance heavy events to consider, I think we have to encompass block-relay related events such as shallow reorgs.",
