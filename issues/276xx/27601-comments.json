As a user, if I provide a custom change address that relates to one of the outputs that I provided, it suggests my intention to send the change to the existing output.

If the user wants to use something for change, then they shouldn't be giving it some value first, because it's change, not an recipient.\r\n\r\nOn second thought, I think we should actually just always error, regardless of whether the wallet thinks the address is change.\r\n\r\n> If user provided the same address for output and change and we show an error.
