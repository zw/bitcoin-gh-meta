These are moved into `wallet_common.{h/cpp}`.\r\n\r\nThe second commit contains a bugfix for the wallet_balance benchmark where it calls `LoadWallet` in the wrong place. It's unnecessary to call that function in this benchmark. Although this does not cause any issues currently, it ends up causing issues in some PRs and branches that I'm working on.",
