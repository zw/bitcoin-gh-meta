      "body" : "> Reduce the signer list to a set of well known, trusted signers\r\n\r\nThe whole point of the transition was to remove a single trusted party being responsible to sign the releases. For obvious reasons, it is problematic if everyone that verifies releases with gpg blindly trust a single fixed party.\r\n\r\nPicking a fixed set of trusted parties is minimally better, but this would open a whole can of worms about adding and removing parties from the \"trusted\" set. Who would be eligible? What is the minimum set size? What is the maximum set size? Who would be ineligible?\r\n\r\nI think the answers to that are inherently subjective, so everyone may reach a different conclusion. It is really up to you to decide who you want to trust and who you don't want to trust. Put differently: No one is holding you back to trust as many or as few people as you want. However, no one can force you to trust a specific set of parties (this is what you are asking here).",
