   "body" : "Add support for generating a transient, one-time I2P address for ourselves when making I2P outbound connection and discard it once the connection is closed.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n---\r\nIn I2P connections, the host that receives the connection knows the I2P address of the connection initiator. This is unlike the Tor network where the recipient does not know who is connecting to them, not even the initiator's Tor address.\r\n\r\nPersistent vs transient I2P addresses\r\n---\r\nEven if an I2P node is not accepting incoming connections, they are known to other nodes by their outgoing I2P address. This creates an opportunity to white-list given nodes or treat them differently based on their I2P address. However, this also creates an opportunity to fingerprint or analyze a given node because it always uses the same I2P address when it connects to other nodes. If this is undesirable, then a node operator can use the newly introduced `-i2ptransientout` to generate a transient (disposable), one-time I2P address for each new outgoing connection. That address is never going to be reused again, not even if reconnecting to the same peer later.\r\n",
