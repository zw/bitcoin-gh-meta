Looks like there is https://github.com/cculianu/univalue which could serve as a drop-in, but I am not sure how much it is maintained, how much it is available as a system package, how much effort it would be to switch to it and if it is even possible to use as a drop-in replacement, considering their and our past changes. \r\n\r\nThere is also https://github.com/nlohmann/json, which is not a library, but a single header file. So I am actually thinking it wouldn't be too much hassle to make our univalue a single C++17 header file as well. At which point it could be trivially copied by other projects (or trivially distributed as a \"library\"), if needed. Though, that seems best to be discussed in a separate thread (or maybe not at all, since it is out-of-scope?).",

And the switch to Univalue was made specifically because it was designed for a purpose that most JSON libraries (at the time, at least) didn't provide: exact roundtripping of the string representation of values (so that it would be possible to use custom encodings and parsings of floating-point values, bypassing the `double` representation that would imply rounding). If we'd want another library, that would be a requirement, I think.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK. The reality is that the current univalue codebase we're using is effectively maintained by us already, and we're relying on many improvements that the original upstream doesn't have.
