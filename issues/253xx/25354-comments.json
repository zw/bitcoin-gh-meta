It's an implementation issue, which seems to have leaked into the protocol definitions of things that have been built on top (incl. RFC8439 itself, which skips the second 32 byte of the chacha20 stream in the chacha20poly1305 cipher). Any protocol relying on it obviously can't just swap out this implementation as it'd be a protocol break, but other than that, either behavior can be implemented in function of either implementation (add a buffer on top in one direction, or introduce explicit skipping steps in the other).",
