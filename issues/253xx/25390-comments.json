      "body" : "This seems like a potentially useful alternative to clang thread safety annotations. The `ThreadSafePtr<T>` class forces code to lock a mutex when accessing data, just like TSA annotations do, except unlike TSA annotations, it doesn't rely on a nonstandard compiler extension, or suffer from quirks that come from doing a limited static analysis.\r\n\r\n`ThreadSafePtr<T>` is obviously not a complete substitute for thread safety annotations since it only handles the simple case where a single non-recursive Mutex is used to protect access to a single variable. But the variable can have any C++ type (primitive, container, or struct), so it's probably flexible enough for a lot of cases.\r\n\r\nI don't think the `ThreadSafePtr<T>` is the best name because `xxx_ptr<T>` implies the type is some kind of lightweight reference to the `T`, not a container which holds the `T`. I would call it something like `Synced<T>` or `LockedData<T>`. (An analogy here would be `std::optional<T>`, which is not called `std::optional_ptr<T>`, even though it has `*` and `->` members, because it's purpose is to be a container, not a pointer. The class is named after what it's used for not what kind of members it has.)",

Proxy class is the actual class acting like a pointer so it needs `*` and `->` methods.

The code itself doesn't seem much better or worse in this case for this very simple data structure, but it's probably is worth experimenting with for chains and chainstates and mempools, etc to be able to avoid logic bugs, distinguish different uses of cs_main for different purposes, and not just have LOCK(cs_main) everywhere what no indication about what exactly is being locked or why.\r\n\r\nLooking at your examples, though I would even more want to replace the `*m` syntax with `m.Lock()` as suggested previously to make usage more obvious.",

In addition - TSA do not actually \"force\" anything, they emit a mere warning if compiled with `clang`. They do nothing for gcc.

Agree implementation should fix this, though.\r\n\r\nI think you'd have to mark the `Synced` object as being lock itself (`LOCKABLE`), and mark the `Proxy` class as being a RAII guard (`SCOPED_LOCKABLE`), with the constructor/destructor annotated appropriately (`EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION(ref_to_scoped_obj)` and `UNLOCK_FUNCTION()`), and with the functions that create the Proxy (`Lock` and `operator->`) annotated with negative constraints (`EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!this)`)? I've got pretty low confidence that that will actually work as hoped/expected though...\r\n\r\n> Well one improvement is that it enforces locking on all compilers, unlike the clang annotations.\r\n\r\nWe already enforce locking is correct via compiling with clang in CI; it's certainly an improvement to get those warnings earlier for anyone who's not using clang or doesn't have the options enabled, but [EDIT: oops, didn't finish the thought:] not at the cost of losing some checks entirely.\r\n",

I changed it to use `{ LOCK(foo); foo->Method1(); foo->Method2(); ... }` so that it is not possible to misuse like @ajtowns suggested [above](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25390#issuecomment-1158434634).\r\n\r\nThe `Synced<T>` abstraction is similar to what is suggested in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24931#discussion_r890636987) but it does so in a generic way to avoid code repetition. Its benefit is twofold:\r\n\r\n1. It avoids code repetition at the implementation sites.

The mutex is properly encapsulated. With a global mutex and a global variable annotated with `GUARDED_BY()` it is indeed not possible to add new code that accesses the variable without protection (if using Clang and `-Wthread-safety-analysis` and `-Werror`), but it is possible to abuse the mutex and start using it to protect some more, possibly unrelated stuff (we already have this in the current code).\r\n",

The difference is that reading from an `atomic` would read it in a safe way from the memory and would return a copy of the stored object. So if we call a method of the stored object the mutex will be released before the method is called and the method will be called on the copy. `atomic` also does not provide a way to lock for longer time, spanning calls to multiple methods.",

I'm still not sure how broadly useful this locking container would be, but I agree having recursive mutex semantics (however they are implemented) would make using it less safe, so better to avoid that if possible.\r\n\r\nAbout the `Guarded`/`PROXY` suggestion specifically:\r\n\r\n- I wonder if `PROXY` macro is necessary. Could `Guarded` class just have a `auto Lock() { return Proxy{*this}; }` method instead? It seems like that could work just as well in a `for` loop or `auto nums = global_nums->Lock()` statement.\r\n- Maybe rename `s/PROXY/GUARDED_LOCK/` so macro name and class name match. This would also be more consistent with other locking macro names `WAIT_LOCK` and `TRY_LOCK` \r\n- Maybe switch `PROXY(name, guarded)` argument order for consistency with `WAIT_LOCK` and `TRY_LOCK` where the new variable name argument is last, and the existing mutex argument is first.\r\n",

I was more interested in the class previously when I thought it was a locking pointer enforcing use of an external mutex (that could be used to migrate code away from using `cs_main`), than a locking container that just used an internal mutex. But it seems like a good thing to use in places where it fits.",

      "body" : "Hmm, when used with shared locks, it seems like clang's thread safety analysis doesn't actually prevent you from calling non-const member functions of a `GUARDED_BY` object when only holding the lock in shared mode (it does prevent you from doing `a = b`, just not `a.set(b)`). So if you take a shared lock over a vector, then resize it and invalidate everyone elses iterators, clang thinks it's all fine.\r\n\r\nWhich I think means that if we wanted to do shared locking more broadly, then this method might be the safest way we have of it: ie have `SYNCED_SHARED(foo,  fooproxy)` take a shared lock and have `*fooproxy` give a `const Foo&` so you can't accidently modify `foo` while you're potentially sharing it with other threads.\r\n\r\nEDIT: for possible future reference, just doing this looks like it works sensibly:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass Synced\r\n{\r\n...\r\n    class SCOPED_LOCKABLE ConstProxy : public ::UniqueLock<Mutex>\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        ConstProxy(const Synced& parent LIFETIMEBOUND, const char* name, const char* file, int line)\r\n            EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION(parent.m_mutex)\r\n            : ::UniqueLock<Mutex>{parent.m_mutex, name, file, line}, m_parent{parent}\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ~ConstProxy() UNLOCK_FUNCTION() {}\r\n\r\n        const T& operator*() LIFETIMEBOUND { return m_parent.m_obj; }\r\n\r\n        const T* operator->() LIFETIMEBOUND { return &m_parent.m_obj; }\r\n\r\n    private:\r\n        const Synced& m_parent;\r\n    };\r\n...\r\n};\r\n\r\n#define SYNCED_SHARED(synced, name) decltype(synced)::ConstProxy name{synced, #synced, __FILE__, __LINE__}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTweaking that to use a `std::shared_lock` instead of `unique_lock` and marking it as `SHARED_LOCK_FUNCTION` instead of exclusive would let us use shared locks pretty easily and safely, I think.\r\n",

Having an array of `bool`s is a bit hackish as it requires that all enums are sequential and start at `0` and requires the existence of `NET_MAX` which smells bad. My plan is to remove `NET_MAX`. Ideally, enum lables should be used without depending on their specific integer values.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if this is controveral I will ditch that change and leave it as `vfLimited[NET_MAX]` since it is not the main topic of this PR.

The pattern:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nMutex m;\r\nType my_variable GUARDED_BY(m);\r\n```\r\n\r\nis very common. The `Synced` structure encapsulates both, enforces the idiom and makes it impossible to \"to abuse the mutex and start using it to protect some more, possibly unrelated stuff\".\r\n\r\nIt also helps remove `GlobalMutex` usages. `GlobalMutex` could be [confusing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27912#discussion_r1259704670).",
