Breaking dependencies is crucial, but splitting internal libs is entirely arbitrary until an external api is defined and there is a logical scope for each lib. So while I'm not a fan of combining the libs, it would be no more than a lateral move really.\r\n\r\n@sipa's recently merged crypto stuff is a good example of how the libs should be broken up going forward. It has a single scope, a well-defined (though obviously not set-in-stone or exposed at the moment) api, and could be entirely swapped out with a new implementation in the future without changing any usage semantics. Granted that's an overly-simple case, but still example-worthy imo.",

And breaking dependencies without having it enforced somehow means it is easy to revert to the previous state. Until there is a well-defined API for the outside world, that's what matters.\r\n\r\nAnyhow - I'm going to rename the library with just `chainparamsbase.cpp`, `rpcprotocol.cpp`, `sync.cpp`, `util.cpp` and `version.cpp` to `libbbitcoin_util.a`. These are the utilities and can be included by all tools that need access to bitcoind's configuration and data directory.\r\n\r\nI'm going to keep `libbitcoin_common.a` around with the rest of the objects that are now in it (except for those moved to libbitcoin_util). @jgarzik can add the ones he needs from libbitcoin_server for the tx tool.\r\n\r\n",
