But indeed it's correct that they fail this new check: b79tx has an input script that connects to an output script, both of which are just OP_TRUE, so we end up with a combined script of OP_TRUE OP_TRUE which leaves >1 stack item.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this isn't actually meant to test such a case, it's just that @TheBlueMatt might have not wanted to write out a full script. Matt, is that the case? If so we can probably make it pass by just changing OP_TRUE in the input script to OP_NOP or something.",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated.
