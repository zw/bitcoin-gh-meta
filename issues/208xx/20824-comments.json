This change is (essentially silently) disabling a security feature in lieu of emitting compiler warnings in situations where you'd actually want them. \r\n\r\nIf someone has overridden `CXXFLAGS` without understanding what they are doing, or any potential consequences, the warnings will alert them to that fact.\r\n\r\nIf someone knows what they are doing, and is providing their own `CXXFLAGS`, they know they can \"fix\" the warnings by adding an optimize option (`-Ox`), or, if they don't want any optimization / don't want to be using `FORTIFY_SOURCE` at all, they can add `-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE` to their `CPPFLAGS` etc.",
