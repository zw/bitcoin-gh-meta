      "body" : "That's a fair point. I did it this way to achieve the effect with the smallest difference in runtime function. `BlockManager::FlushBlockFile` can flush the undo file later in that method. For example, if you start out with some read-only blk files and have removed the corresponding rev*.dat files, the difference is that the way I did it will still create the rev files when the flush is called. If you don't call the flush, then the rev files won't be created then. This might be a meaningless difference. I'll look deeper into the undo file handling. If we avoid the flush entirely, maybe we could make the corresponding undo files read-only (but I tend to think that's less useful and possibly not all that desirable).",
