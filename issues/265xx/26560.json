   "body" : "This comes with #26559, targeting master and not v24.\r\n\r\nSolving few bugs inside the wallet's transaction creation\r\nprocess and adding test coverage for them.\r\nPlus, making use of the `CoinsResult::total_amount` cached value\r\ninside the Coin Selection process to return early if we don't have\r\nenough funds to cover the target amount.\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n\r\n1) The `CoinsResult::Erase` method removes only one\r\noutput from the available coins vector (there is a [loop break](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c1061be14a515b0ed4f4d646fcd0378c62e6ded3/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L112)\r\nthat should have never been there) and not all the preset inputs.\r\n\r\n   Which on master is not a problem, because since [#25685](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25685)\r\n   we are no longer using the method. But, it's a dangerous\r\n   bug on v24 (check [#26559](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26559)).\r\n\r\n   This method it's being fixed and not removed because I'm later using it to solve\r\n   another bug inside this PR.\r\n\r\n2) As we update the total cached amount of the `CoinsResult` object inside\r\n   `AvailableCoins` and we don't use such function inside the coin selection\r\n   tests (we manually load up the `CoinsResult` object), there is a discrepancy\r\n   between the outputs that we add/erase from the object and the total amount\r\n   cached value.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* This makes use of the `CoinsResult` total cached amount to early return\r\n  with an \"Insufficient funds\" error inside Coin Selection if the tx target\r\n  amount is greater than the sum of all the wallet available coins plus the\r\n  preset inputs amounts (we don't need to perform the entire coin selection\r\n  process if we already know that there aren't enough funds inside our wallet).\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n1) Adds test coverage for the duplicated preset input selection bug that we have in v24.\r\n  Where the wallet invalidly selects the preset inputs twice during the Coin Selection\r\n  process. Which ends up with a \"good\" Coin Selection result that does not cover the\r\n  total tx target amount. Which, alone, crashes the wallet due an insane fee.\r\n  But.. to make it worst, adding the subtract fee from output functionality\r\n  to this mix ends up with the wallet by-passing the \"insane\" fee assertion,\r\n  decreasing the output amount to fulfill the insane fee, and.. sadly,\r\n  broadcasting the tx to the network.\r\n\r\n2) Adds test coverage for the `CoinsResult::Erase` method.",
