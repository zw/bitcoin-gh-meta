      "body" : "> Since fsync doesn't do the whole job, it shouldn't silence the error/return-false when F_FULLFSYNC fails.\r\n\r\nSorry, I was unclear. (I'll edit my comment.) `fsync` does eventually physically write to disk on macOS, but it just does it on its own time. It's more vulnerable to corruption / data loss if, for example, the machine or drive loses power. The `F_FULLFSYNC` option is better just because it actually physically writes *immediately* after it flushes to disk. Prior to #3000, the macOS version just used `fsync`. This PR goes back to using `fsync` if the (better) `F_FULLFSYNC` isn't available. \r\n\r\n> And if, as you say, some drives claim to have done it while they actually haven't, should we perhaps consider falling back to fsync even if F_FULLFSYNC succeeds?\r\n\r\nSome drives claim to write immediately with the `fcntl F_FULLFSYNC` call, but in reality only do the equivalent of macOS's version of `fsync` -- that is, they just flush to disk, return ASAP, and let the disk actually physically write whenever it wants, rather than blocking until the physical write is complete.\r\n\r\n> Or maybe F_FULLFSYNC always at least does the equivalent of fsync?\r\n\r\nI think that's what happens for the drives that 'lie', which is what I just talked about. However, I don't think any actual flushes or physical writes happen if `F_FULLFYNC` returns an error.",

      "body" : "@jamesob , thank you for your kind words and the time you took to review.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr Thanks for the comment, Luke. I believe I understand your point -- that`FileCommit` exists to assure that the data is actually physically written by the time the function returns, so we shouldn't let macOS get away with breaking that contract just because the hardware doesn't support it. It's better to simply fail (or, alternatively, allow other systems to get away with the same behavior). \r\n\r\nMy thinking was that doing macOS's poor `fsync` was better than leaving the hardware unsupported. To be fair, it does do *something* in this case -- it flushes the buffer to the drive. However, it doesn't provide the [full guarantee implied by the comments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d415b7261c05dafbc3e65eea72d270b2bed0958b/src/util/system.h#L57-L58). My assumption was that it was more of a 'best-effort' situation.\r\n\r\nI'll obviously defer to your judgment in situations like these, so I'm happy to close this if my understanding of your comment was correct.",

      "body" : "@luke-jr We flush the block files whenever there is a write to the block index, because the block index contains references (file numbers, byte offsets) to the blk*.dat files. So if somehow a write to the block index does make it, but a write to the block data does not, we may have a corruption. Similarly, we flush the block index before flushing the chainstate, because the chainstate contains references to the block index.\n\nIn that sense, we really don't primarily use flushing for finality, but for ordering operations on disk. I suspect that even on systems where a flush doesn't actually cause the write to hit disk, it'll still order operations (writes before will make it before writes after do).",
