Obviously an overall good development which we don't need to rehash the merits of here.\r\n\r\nIdeally these components are loosely coupled (they aren't really right now but I think we will/should get there eventually), such that the internal state of one is not dependent on the internal state of the other. Even though they are still tightly coupled at the moment, we should not rely on that to be the case going forward. So in my opinion, any user of the CConnman & PeerManager API (in this case the RPC handler querying statistics) should not expect there to be consistency between the internal state of these two modules and instead handle the edge cases (e.g. only one component returns stats) on its own end.\r\n\r\nI like this PR because it is essentially doing what I describe above, that is handling the edge case in which only the CNode stats are available while the application layer stats are not (due to the connection being dropped in between the queries).",
