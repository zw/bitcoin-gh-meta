   "body" : "I have only noticed that all the \"old\" translation files are being used for v19 after being mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17027.\r\nDue to some reorganizing on transifex, some language files should never have ended in v19. The correct way to update would be to delete all existing translation files and run the script afterwards.\r\nThis is the result.\r\n\r\nFWIW: Why are there less files than before? It's because there was a lot of duplication on transifex. For example, Korean would be translated into _(ko)_ as well as _(ko_KR)_. I've deleted ko_KR in such cases, and merged such translations together to get one, more completed translation file.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure how to deal with 019 appropriately, so I made this PR to master.",
