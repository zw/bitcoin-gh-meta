I think its nice cause it is completely optional, both at build-time, and in the sense that we can have threads that are doing that crash (without bringing down the rest of Core due to panic catches) without it making the rest of Core broken.\r\n * I think we should air towards \"minimum version of the language we can get by with\" until we have a reason not to, and we can discuss it more then. Largely, I think #16834 is ready-to-go enough (mod review) that we can pretty much move forward with it without committing to a lot of these decisions today.\r\n * WRT cargo-vs-rustc: I don't see a lot of reason to use cargo. The major benefit it provides is downloading arbitrary code from github, building it, and linking it into your program. Obviously this isn't helpful for us, and we'll almost certainly subtree any dependencies we take, and I went and tested linking dependencies that are subtree'd without cargo and its just a few more flags to rustc.",

However, this is a chicken-and-egg problem and can be solved by adding rust in small steps.\r\n\r\nFinally, a concern was that we aren't running into many bugs that rust could prevent. Rust can prevent memory and race issues, but not logic errors. While I initially agreed with this point, I concluded that switching to rust will help us with memory issues (at least for the code written in rust). Just to dig up some examples from master, that would have been impossible in rust: #6636, #16796, #13351. Happy to dig out more, but I think they are good illustrations. On top of that, I (and other people, such as a resident in the recent Chaincode Summer residency) am running into segfaults and other memory issues on a regular basis. Those runtime errors require a lot of developer attention (running in gdb, valgrind, sanitizers). Rust makes them impossible and might thus speed up the workflow.",

      "body" : "I agree with most of what was said here with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n1. Even though I don't know of any security critical bug bitcoin had that was memory related I think in the long term rust can help a lot with both review time and implementation time. \r\nBecause right now when someone opens a PR with a function that for example accepts a raw pointer part of the review is to look everywhere that function is used and make sure there's no way to  get to a dangling pointer or to accidentally dereference a null pointer. \r\nAll of these problems are no-ops in safe rust. so even if currently the bitcoin review process is good at eliminating most of these problems Rust can help save review time.\r\n\r\n2. Personally and I'll guess for other non C++ experts, writing C++ sometimes feel scary because you're not 100% there's no UB in your code and there's not some edge case with memory issue, this problem is mitigated with sanitizers, valgrind and good review process. but it's better to *know* your code does what you think it does. (again this is only about memory un-clearity not logic)\r\n\r\nNow about rust itself:\r\n\r\n1. I think that if we plan to make this experimental and optional for a while i'll go for the latest rust compiler available right now. because when and if it will ever be an inherit part of bitcoin `mrustc` will probably support newer versions(already at the verge of 1.29 support[1] ) and maybe even a gcc frontend will arise by then[2]\r\n\r\n2. I do understand the idea of not requiring any version newer than what is shipped with latest distros, but I think that any safety feature we'll miss because of \"supporting the oldest compiler possible\" will make us miss the entire point of using rust.\r\n\r\n3. I see no point in using Edition 2015, as Edition 2018 was stabilized in Rust 1.31. That said this is only an esthetic change, so I don't have strong feelings about it.\r\n\r\n4. Cargo vs. rustc. I think that as long as we can get away with using rustc directly it's fine, but I don't think this will work for the long term. \r\n\r\n5. Combining point 4 and 1, I think that when we will want cargo and when we will have dependencies then we will want a feature like `cargo vendor` which was added to cargo in 1.37 so that's another reason for using an up to date rust version. on top of that the mentioned security advisory(I found btw) is an example on why it's problematic to use old versions of fast evolving tools. I hope the rust and cargo team will learn from that experience for future features but I would argue that we should try and use an up to date rust version.\r\n\r\nQuick simple example of dependencies we will want to use if we continue to integrate rust is `cbindgen` and `rust-bindgen` as FFI calling is a very easy way to introduce UB that no compiler will warn about (if the rust and C declarations won't match correctly).\r\n\r\nP.S. If people want I can try and give a list of examples of features we might need that aren't available in old rustc versions. and that's without talking about changes to the borrow checker that makes writing rust code way easier.\r\n\r\n[1]  https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc/issues/95#issuecomment-538747289\r\n[2] https://users.rust-lang.org/t/call-for-help-implementing-an-independent-rust-frontend-for-gcc/32163",

One engineer responded by making an extra effort to go through the company's codebase and delete code, ensuring they would rank at the very bottom of the chart, with _negative_ LOC each month.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of must-be-secure high quality code, less is more.   Less code probablistically produces fewer bugs, fewer LOC to review and analyze, and is easier to prove secure.\r\n\r\nThis was the origin of the `--disable-wallet` compile time flag.  This permits eliding GUI and wallet code, focusing on the network-security-sensitive kernel as the minimized runtime attack surface for validating nodes.\r\n\r\nIntegrating two languages tends to go in the opposite direction from complexity reduction.  FFI and unsafe rust and hidden sand traps galore.  It takes another 10 years to move the C++/Rust boundary to 75+% rust.\r\n\r\nTrying to take a step back and think holistically,\r\n\r\n1. There is a numerically large userbase for \"the kernel\" - the network validating engine - and numerically small userbase for the GUI and wallet.\r\n2. The kernel should be in a repo by itself, without a kitchen sink of other code such as wallet or GUI.  Those accessories can live in git repos that use the kernel repo as a submodule.  This creates incentives for the kernel repo (and issues and workflow) become more simple, less complex over time.\r\n3. Build a separate, safe Rust validating engine.  Run in parallel with C++ to observe A/B differences in field operation.\r\n4. Migrate wallet/GUI to use REST/zmq/etc. interfaces.\r\n5. At this point, switch to Rust engine can safely be done.\r\n\r\nEnd result in medium term is a less complex core.\r\nEnd result in longer term is less complex core... in Rust.\r\n",

Prefer linting to happen during the regular local build/testing though rather than just in Travis, and think that we should have tooling which makes it simple to emit bindings to be committed to keep development flow simple. We should also be careful to not allow bindings which *aren't* generatable from CBindgen, so even if we aren't relying on it for build we can be sure it's in line with what could be machine generated.",
