   "body" : "This is the first two commits from #25574, leaving out all changes to `-verifychain` error-handling :\r\n\r\n- The Problem of [25563](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25563) is that when we skip blocks at level 3 due to an insufficient dbcache (skipping some `DisconnectBlock()` calls), we would still attempt the level 4 checks, attempting to reconnect a block that was never disconnected, leading to an assert in `ConnectBlock()`.\r\nFix this by not attempting level 4 checks in this case.\r\n- Logging of verification progress is now split over multiple lines. This is more verbose, but now each update has its own timestamp, and other threads logging concurrently will no longer lead to mangled output. \r\n\r\nThis can be tested with a small `dbcache` value, for example:\r\n`bitcoind -signet -dbcache=10`\r\n`bitcoin-cli -signet verifychain 4 1000`\r\n\r\nFixes #25563",
