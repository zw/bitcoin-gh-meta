But there are other rules that involve witness data, such as resource limits and the rule that no witness data is allowed for non-witness inputs. \r\n\r\nSo it shifts the meaning of (our baked in) `-assumevalid` somewhat, but only for pruned nodes. Uses may not expect that syncing with `-prune` performs less validation than without. So this probably needs a separate configuration flag.\r\n\r\n> One downside is that nodes serving blocks without witnesses can't serve them directly from disk. They have to un-serialize and re-serialize without the witnesses before sending them.\r\n\r\nDo you mean serving nodes that don't have the witness data? Or do you mean nodes that do (but that's already the case then)?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nodes that come fresh out of IBD we should carefully test the behavior before and after the assumevalid drops below the prune height. Because at that point we should signal `NODE_WITNESS`. For better discoverability we should probably always announce that. In that case we should start downloading witness data a bit before the `assumevalid` block if we're a recent release. But this gets tricky, because the node doesn't know how big future blocks are, so doesn't know when to start downloading witness data. We could change the release process to ensure `assumevalid` is deep enough to account for that.",

Maybe that makes it worth looking into more?\r\n\r\nWell I was more focused on my perception of the complexity than the benefit I guess, but you may be right.  I have a number of thoughts that likely could be addressed if we can think about these issues clearly enough, but some things to consider:\r\n\r\n- whether we are in \"prune mode\" is a slightly nuanced idea. Nodes that are configured to have huge block databases and nodes that only prune when manually told to would both qualify as \"pruning nodes\" in the logic used here, which means that nodes might download blocks without witness and never actually delete them. (If we restarted with pruning disabled, then we would need to detect that our block storage is missing witnesses and force a reindex, which in turn would cause us to have to redownload all those blocks.). This is all doable logic, but just a messy edge case to consider.\r\n\r\n- we should be careful about having our code be robust to situations where a pruning node might find itself relaying a block at its tip even while it's catching up, and if the user has set their assumevalid close to the network's tip then you might imagine a problem being created from the pruning node advertising a block without the witness data to go with it.  Maybe there is a clean way to think about this, where we enforce that a pruning node will never announce a block unless the block and the prior 288 blocks were all downloaded with witness?\r\n\r\nWhen I first started thinking about this, I was contemplating that assumeutxo would be where we should spend our engineering resources, but now that I think a little more, maybe this feature (if we can design it properly) would compose nicely with assumeutxo (specifically around how much background validation happens when a node downloads the chain from scratch -- maybe we could allow users to have different levels of validation like we do today).

Once you have the headers, your node has the initiative and is going to ask specific blocks. (And you don't need the witness data itself to check the block hash).",

I was trying to imply that this does not happen very often currently, as (Bitcoin Core) nodes will always ask for blocks with witnesses from peers that signal `NODE_WITNESS`. However with this PR, pruned nodes will primarily ask for blocks without the witnesses during IBD (up to the assume-valid point), which results in some extra computational cost for serving nodes (this can be optimized a little bit, as [andrewtoth pointed out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#discussion_r1097532417).) The relevant logic can be found [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e08e5cb5cca57cef9e7a6b557e359ef911dbfaa/src/net_processing.cpp#L2172-L2188).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you all for the discussion so far! I updated the PR description to include the edge cases and suggestions mentioned here as TODOs.\r\n",

Skipping the downloading of witnesses negates that security by making it possible to sync a pruned node without anyone having that data available.\r\n\r\nA concrete example where this could become relevant is in the event that courts order Bitcoin node operators to not serve specific blocks that are claimed to contain illegal data: an adversary can easily spin up patched Bitcoin nodes that do not serve those witnesses, in conjunction with the distribution of a new assumed-valid hash.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in conjunction with the above - or as a stand alone action - courts can simply order Bitcoin devs/node runners to use an assumed valid hash that contains a transaction with an invalid signature to confiscate/\"recover\" funds. This of course is a possible outcome of the Craig Wright case.\r\n\r\nThe difference with this patch from the status quo, is we'd already be shipping software that without any user intervention other than running with the appropriate assumed valid flag, would appear to work even though it was impossible for anyone to prove that something nefarious was going on.\r\n\r\nNACK - This is not worth the consequences for a 43% savings.",

What you are suggesting does trust miners.\n\nRecently the US based Foundry USA approached 50% of hash power, and it appears that much of the hashing power pointed to them is contractually obliged to mine at Foundry. Assuming that miners only mine valid blocks is not a good idea.\n\nAnother way of looking at it is if you aren't validating signatures, at least indirectly, why are you even bothering to download witnesses? Why not just use a UTXO snapshot? You aren't even doing a good job of inflation control: theft of lost coins _is_ an example of inflation.\n",

So the trust assumption here is: **If there is no archival node accessible, we still trust an Assumevalid release that was audited/reviewed although it's not possible to currently audit it.** \r\n\r\nThis is true because archival nodes, by definition, store all witness data. So if there's no archival node but, for some reason there are nodes serving all non-witness data and witness data from non-Assumevalid blocks, this type of pruned node will operate under a stronger assumption (that a previous Assumevalid release is valid, although not auditable).\r\n\r\nHowever Bitcoin **is already** operating under the assumption that archival nodes are available. If they weren't available no full node would be able to sync. If the new pruned node type is introduced, these nodes could still sync if only witness data from Assumevalid blocks is missing. \r\n\r\nRuling out a systematic failure that makes all archival nodes to lose only witness data from Assumevalid blocks, the only way something like that could happen is if all archival nodes decided to selectively delete/not serve Assumevalid witness data, but store/serve everything else. If no node served historic data in general (witness and non-witness), it would be impossible for our new type of pruned node to sync, and if all \"archival\" nodes were pre-segwit, then our node couldn't sync either.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this doesn't change anything fundamentally.

      "body" : "@petertodd Thanks for commenting and challenging the approach!\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, your main concern is about witness availability. As it currently stands that availability is required to sync a full node (pruned or not), as we are checking that the witness merkle root that is committed to matches with the witnesses that are actually downloaded. So even though we are skipping script validation, we require the exact witnesses (which we are assuming to be valid) to be available. By enabling pruned nodes to not download the witnesses (which requires skipping the witness merkle root check), we remove the requirement of witness availability (at least for assumed-valid blocks) to sync a pruned node. Witness availability is obviously important to be able to audit the chain with `-assumevalid=0`, which is a big part of our security assumptions behind assume-valid.\r\n\r\nYou are not arguing that stopping to request witnesses (i.e. removing the need to have them available for syncing) somehow makes them less available, right? My thoughts on this would be similar/the same to what Sjors said: pruned nodes already don't serve historical witnesses and this PR does not prevent archival nodes from storing/serving them, so IMO witness availability is not directly threatened by this PR.\r\n\r\niiuc, you are saying that removing the witness availability requirement makes it possible to assume a chain valid without ever seeing the invalid witnesses (since witnesses are no longer forced to be revealed). This seems entirely possible but updating the default assume valid hash in Bitcoin Core always involves auditing (I would expect anyone to audit their own choice of that hash as well) and a chain that fails the audit due to witness unavailability would not be made the default. Of course like you say, a court could try to mandate the inclusion of a specific assume-valid hash but that just leads us to the final backstop we always have:  As long as a economic majority can't be forced to upgrade their nodes, the new rules won't be adopted. Under the assumption that that is in fact possible, a court can mandate worse things than an invalid assume-valid hash.\r\n\r\nIt is currently not possible to set the assume-valid hash to a chain with unavailable witnesses, however it is currently possible to set it to a chain with available but invalid witnesses. What is worse, unavailable or invalid witnesses? I would argue, that they are equally bad because they can achieve the exact same nefarious outcomes.\r\n\r\n> The difference with this patch from the status quo, is we'd already be shipping software that without any user intervention other than running with the appropriate assumed valid flag, would appear to work even though it was impossible for anyone to prove that something nefarious was going on.\r\n\r\nBeing forced to assume a chain valid which I can't audit (due to witness unavailability), sounds like a clear indication of something nefarious going on to me (but yea, one couldn't *prove* that).",

Instead, the hashes are fixed by Bitcoin Core because we don't trust users to audit their own choice of UTXO set.\r\n\r\n@naumenkogs assumeutxo is much more likely to \"help node running culture\" in terms of getting more pruned nodes up and running. And it has the advantage of having much more clear security considerations: you are trusting the assumed UTXO. \r\n\r\nAnyway, a way to mitigate these concerns about the reduction in security margin would be to simply put \"skip-witness\" mode behind a command line flag and leave it default off. Remember that many, probably most, nodes have ample bandwidth available and thus won't actually see an improvement from skipping witness downloads. That's certainly been the case for most of my nodes, which are mostly in data centers, and have been IO/CPU limited during IBD, not bandwidth limited. \"Node-in-a-box\" solutions like Umbrel and Start9, more frequently used on slower home internet connections and Tor, can consider enabling the skip-witness mode by default (or perhaps after a bandwidth test).",

      "body" : "> It's important to recognize that this is a security reduction, even though it only applies to assumed-valid blocks: one of the reasons why assume-valid is acceptable, is because the data that we're assuming is valid is widely available for independent auditing and our peers can't distinguish between nodes that are and are not actually checking it. Skipping the downloading of witnesses negates that security by making it possible to sync a pruned node without anyone having that data available.\r\n\r\n> A concrete example where this could become relevant is in the event that courts order Bitcoin node operators to not serve specific blocks that are claimed to contain illegal data: an adversary can easily spin up patched Bitcoin nodes that do not serve those witnesses, in conjunction with the distribution of a new assumed-valid hash.\r\n\r\n> Similarly, in conjunction with the above - or as a stand alone action - courts can simply order Bitcoin devs/node runners to use an assumed valid hash that contains a transaction with an invalid signature to confiscate/\"recover\" funds. This of course is a possible outcome of the Craig Wright case.\r\n\r\n> The difference with this patch from the status quo, is we'd already be shipping software that without any user intervention other than running with the appropriate assumed valid flag, would appear to work even though it was impossible for anyone to prove that something nefarious was going on.\r\n\r\n> NACK - This is not worth the consequences for a 43% savings.\r\n\r\n> The status quo does not trust miners. What you are suggesting does trust miners.\r\n\r\n> Recently the US based Foundry USA approached 50% of hash power, and it appears that much of the hashing power pointed to them is contractually obliged to mine at Foundry. Assuming that miners only mine valid blocks is not a good idea.\r\n\r\n> Another way of looking at it is if you aren't validating signatures, at least indirectly, why are you even bothering to download witnesses? Why not just use a UTXO snapshot? You aren't even doing a good job of inflation control: theft of lost coins _is_ an example of inflation.\r\n\r\nLove the adversarial thinking shared in quoted comments by Peter Todd leaving aside the emotions.\r\n\r\nNACK \r\n\r\nI do not agree with the changes made in this pull request\r\n\r\n> Anyway, a way to mitigate these concerns about the reduction in security margin would be to simply put \"skip-witness\" mode behind a command line flag and leave it default off. Remember that many, probably most, nodes have ample bandwidth available and thus won't actually see an improvement from skipping witness downloads. That's certainly been the case for most of my nodes, which are mostly in data centers, and have been IO/CPU limited during IBD, not bandwidth limited. \"Node-in-a-box\" solutions like Umbrel and Start9, more frequently used on slower home internet connections and Tor, can consider enabling the skip-witness mode by default (or perhaps after a bandwidth test).\r\n\r\nMaybe we can have such useless options similar to the patch created by Luke Dashjr recently\r\n\r\nNote: Default matters a lot in bitcoin core and its used by 99% nodes. Nobody wants to play with their money and use different values unless they know what they are doing.",
