But `trusted-keys` is loaded via the `gpg.sh`, and so it does change. \r\n\r\nThat makes sense because the list of trusted keys changes through time. But it means the newly added hash only have an effect if you call verify-commits with one of those hashes. In that case we check that commit against the current `trusted-keys`. If on the other hand you start traversing from HEAD~1, it uses the old `trusted-keys` and won't error.\r\n\r\nYou can see this difference in behavior by amending this commit to drop one of the hashes. The verify-commits script will fail if you pass it that hash, and succeed if you don't.\r\n\r\nIt would probably help if it cloned the repo in tmp rather than operate on itself.\r\n\r\nStill I think we can merge with these hashes added and improve the script later.\r\n\r\nI've checked the commit list in aafa5e945cef7a4f65ddadcf548932dd4e27ada1 against the list generated by @ajtowns's incantation. Also checked that this commit was signed by @laanwj.\r\n\r\nNote to other testers: the [verify-commits.py](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/verify-commits/README.md) script can be a bit cryptic when a PGP key has expired. Use `git verify-commit` on the commit it trips over to see which key is expired and then refresh it (or just refresh all of them).",
