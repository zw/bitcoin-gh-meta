   "body" : "This is split from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797 which is a full implementation with an Autotools feature parity and has more than 80 commits.\r\n\r\nA bit [rehashed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797#issue-1330985812) list of benefits of a CMake-based build system over an Autotools-based one:\r\n\r\n## General benefits\r\n\r\n1. [Integration](https://www.kitware.com/static-checks-with-cmake-cdash-iwyu-clang-tidy-lwyu-cpplint-and-cppcheck/) with developer tools like clang-tidy, IWYU etc.\r\n\r\n2. CTest tool with a bunch of useful features, including coverage analysis, integration with sanitizers and memory check tools like valgrind.\r\n\r\n3. [CPack](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Packaging%20With%20CPack.html), a powerful packaging tool.\r\n\r\n4. Integration with IDEs.\r\n\r\n5. The concept of a \"target with assosiated properties\" is better than Autotools' global variables in many ways (robustness, readability, maintanability).\r\n\r\n6. _[social]_ A great community. CMake is actively developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Bitcoin Core specific benefits\r\n\r\nA preliminary note. Two arguments (a) \"nobody cares about X platform\" and (b) \"nobody cares about Y binary\" are out of this PR scope, as long as the X platform is promised to be supported by the Bitcoin Core project, and the Y binary is a part of the Bitcoin Core project.\r\n\r\n7. Native Windows support. No longer need to maintain `build_msvc` subdirectory.\r\n\r\n8. Correctness with Windows DLLs out-of-the-box. In comparison, the current build system has 3 ([three!](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25008#issuecomment-1113964111)) hacks of libtool. And it is still broken:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19772\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25008\r\n\r\n9. CMake is a native build system of [Qt 6](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-manual.html).\r\n\r\n10. _[social]_ It is [expected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797#issuecomment-1408772481) that more current and new developers are/will be able/willing to review/contribute/maintain CMake code rather Autotools stuff.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nThere are two goals:\r\n- merge all CMake code by v25.0 and test it\r\n- switch to the CMake-based build system by v26.0\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n\r\nIn particular, this PR establishes the minimum required CMake [version](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/CMake-Versions-on-Linux-Distros). As it looks non-productive to support Ubuntu Bionic as a build platform, version [3.13](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.13.html) has been chosen. Benefits of v3.13 over v3.10 which affect our CMake code directly are as [follow](https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/blob/220807-cmake/CMakeLists.txt):\r\n```CMake\r\n#  - 3.11: add_library() and add_executable() commands can now be called without any sources\r\n#          and will not complain as long as sources are added later via the target_sources()\r\n#          command.\r\n#  - 3.11: The target_*() commands learned to set the INTERFACE properties on Imported Targets.\r\n#  - 3.12: The add_compile_definitions() command was added to set preprocessor definitions\r\n#          at directory level. This supersedes add_definitions().\r\n#  - 3.12: If the CONFIGURE_DEPENDS flag is specified, CMake will add logic to the main\r\n#          build system check target to rerun the flagged GLOB commands at build time.\r\n#  - 3.12: The target_link_libraries() command now supports Object Libraries.\r\n#  - 3.12: A new $<TARGET_EXISTS:...> generator expression has been added.\r\n#  - 3.12: A new FindPython3 module has been added to provide a new way to locate python\r\n#          environments.\r\n#  - 3.13: The install(TARGETS) command learned to install targets created outside the current\r\n#          directory.\r\n#  - 3.13: The target_link_options() command was created to specify link options for targets\r\n#          and their dependents.\r\n#  - 3.13: The target_link_libraries() command may now be called to modify targets created\r\n#          outside the current directory.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes for reviewers\r\n\r\nTo configure a build system, one can run in their local repo root:\r\n```sh\r\ncmake -S . -B  build\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo re-configure, it is recommended to use the clean build tree, for example:\r\n```sh\r\nrm -rf build\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now, the only artifact we explicitly create in the build tree is a `bitcoin-config.h` header:\r\n```sh\r\ncat build/src/config/bitcoin-config.h\r\n```",
