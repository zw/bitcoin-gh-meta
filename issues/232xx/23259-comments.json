Rather a hacked together python script proxy than a hacked together c++ http server in core. And nothing says the script has to be hacked together :)",

Infact it is the only thing I liked in Bitcoin Core because GUI feels like Windows 95. Although UI/UX is not a problem anymore since lot of projects have better GUI with option to use Bitcoin Core with RPC credentials.\r\n\r\nIt the goal is to remove unnecessary things and focus on important things, improve them etc. based on below tweet:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/JeremyRubin/status/1440402791676014595\r\n\r\nI think we should keep both JSON-RPC and REST. Maybe remove `bitcoin-qt`. There are trade-offs and few developers might prefer REST. If security is a concern, it can be improved and some of the things are already mentioned in [doc/REST-interface.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md) and [doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md](https://github.com/prayank23/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)",

      "body" : "From reading the initial PR (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2844), it seems ease-of-use/accessibility was the main concern when introducing the REST API (and interestingly, it had a lot of the same discussion we have here, including suggesting a Python script approach). I think having a fully mature, functional and easy-to-use REST API would be a significant driver in having developers (especially for smaller projects) build directly on Bitcoin Core instead of on third-party APIs, or even not building at all.\r\n\r\nWith e.g. #25752 I was going for a more iterative approach, but I'm starting to see more benefit in having a separate service on top of the JSON-RPC as suggested here. It would obviously have a performance impact, but I think that's okay, since imo the first thing to optimize for is ease-of-use, and then if we notice sufficient adoption, performance bottlenecks can be fixed if and where necessary. Extending and improving/overhauling the current REST API is probably too much of a burden without visible demand, realistically. \r\n\r\nA couple of questions:\r\n- In this proposal, I don't see any more reason to limit the REST API to unauthenticated endpoints, but rather should go for full feature parity. Does anyone see that differently?\r\n- Would Rust or Go be a better alternative instead of Python? I think that might be less controversial here for production services (I'm a Python developer), and they both seem to fit all the requirements (especially Go if async is important, which I'm not 100% convinced it is - the overhead of spinning up more workers is low)\r\n",
