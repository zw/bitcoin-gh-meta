Not sure the the locking guidelines for Peer make sense (see \"annotate lock guideline violation?\" commit) though (and generally not convinced we need the multiple per-peer state mutexes that Peer has).\r\n\r\nI think it might make sense to have CNode have an opaque Peer pointer member that's provided by net_processing when the connection is first made and passed back to net_processing via the PeerManager interface -- that would obsolete a lot of the \"state for this peer\" lookups, and might simplify locking substantially. Bit complicated to think about, so I stopped at this point, but that was what I was originally looking to explore here.",

It moves PeerManagerImpl into its own translation unit (net_processing_impl.cpp), with the declaration of PeerManagerImpl in net_processing_impl.h. That header file is only included by net_processing.cpp (so the std::unique_ptr<PeerManagerImpl> can be constructed) and the test files. The tests are updated to use a PeerManagerImpl instead of a PeerManager.\r\n\r\nThe result is that PeerManager and net_processing.h don't need to include any functions that are for test only. That header file and PeerManager's public interface are about as minimal as possible (the only exposed methods are RelayTransaction, GetNodeStateStats and IgnoresIncomingTxs). Meanwhile, everything in PeerManagerImpl can be made public (since it's behind a compilation firewall so effectively everything is hidden from other translation units), and the tests can access any method/data in the class.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Is this something we should consider?",

This seems even better!\r\n\r\n> I think maybe it'd be even better to focus on making the classes smaller so they can be tested purely via their public interfaces though, and not worry too much about exposing a few extra methods in the meantime?\r\n\r\nAlso ACK making classes smaller. I think the tx_request module is a great example of how we can make the code clearer and better tested by breaking up the functionality. Perhaps block downloading, orphan handling, addr relay, etc could get similar treatment in future.\r\n\r\nAside: I think 'tested purely via their public interfaces' is an OOP mantra that sounds good in theory, but white-box testing is too useful to throw out entirely, especially when dealing with legacy code that has existing large modules/classes.\r\n\r\nThis can all be left for future work though. I think just implementing the PeerManagerImpl is a great first step. I'd love to help get this reviewed and merged. Perhaps everything up to _move PeerManagerImpl into cpp file_ could be split into a PR for review first?",
