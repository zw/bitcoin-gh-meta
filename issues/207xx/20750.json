This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",
