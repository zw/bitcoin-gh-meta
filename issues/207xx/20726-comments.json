      "body" : "@sipa Thanks for taking a look!\r\n\r\n> If I understand it correctly, the BIP idea doesn't concern itself with this being outbound->inbound or not, but the implementation only ever announces it in the outbound direction, and will disconnect if it's received from a (full) outbound peer. Is that worth pointing out (e.g. \"Peers MAY decide to not serve peers that announce this flag\").\r\n\r\nYes good observation.  When I was working on this, I realized that there was no protocol need to restrict this as being a message from inbound->outbound peer, so while I didn't have an immediate use case for outbound peers sending this message to inbound ones, I also thought there seemed to be little downside to permitting it in the future.\r\n\r\nThe only case where I thought it could be problematic is if we connect out to a peer that we expect to be a full-relay peer, and it turns out the peer tells us we won't get any transactions from them -- in this case I think we ought to disconnect.  (Arguably it's a bug that today we don't do this when we get fRelay=false from such a peer in their version message.)\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to reflect that peers should feel free to use this information in deciding who to stay connected to.\r\n\r\n> Should interaction with tx-relay specific other messages like mempool, filterload, filteradd, filterclear, feefilter be specified (e.g. these messages are disabled/forbidden/ignored on block only connections)?\r\n\r\nYes, I should both specify that those messages are not permitted, and I think disconnect peers who send them to us after negotiating BLOCKRELAY. I think this will require an extra piece of state for outbound peers who might send us a BLOCKRELAY message, but that seems no big deal.\r\n \r\n> Maybe it's worth pointing out that blocktxn/getblocktxn still function?\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to explicitly reflect this as well.\r\n",

It's a 20 line change, and doesn't seem too complex.\r\n\r\nThe downside to an approach like this (for both `m_addr_known` and `m_tx_relay`) is that we don't get the benefit of limiting and bounding the resources that will be used on the peer at the time of connection.  Adding a p2p message that is sent at the start of a connection (such as the one proposed here) allows us to do that.  Once we have a way to bound the resources of a peer that is connecting to us with this intent, I plan to propose that we increase the number of inbound connection slots that we can service, and reserve some of those for BLOCKRELAY peers.  From there, I think we could then start to increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections we make without concern that we are taking over too many inbound connection slots on the network or using up too many node resources.\r\n\r\nFor some additional context, please see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480400958 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19858#issuecomment-688918364.

      "body" : "I wondered whether the better approach would be to add a new bool to indicate whether tx-relay is disabled (like we have for compact blocks, or sendheaders, etc), or to update the connection type like I've done here. \r\n\r\nMy hesitation to add a new bool was that it seemed counter to the recent work to refactor `net` to use connection types as an alternative to the bucket-of-bool's approach for deciding how to interact with a peer.  If we have a set of semantics that we understand go together for a given peer, it's nice for code readability to encode that as simply as possible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my intention with the BIP was to allow future flexibility for what semantics might be possible (eg my intention is to allow for addr-relay to happen in the future if we add an explicit way to negotiate addr relay, as an example), so from that perspective, having a connection type perhaps implies too much of an understanding of what the peer may be doing.  And for inbound peers in particular, we never really know what they're doing, so perhaps having more than just \"inbound\" as a connection type may be misleading to future code readers as well.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of moving initialization of `m_tx_relay` to VERACK, but not sure if I'll end up tackling that here or deferring for the current refactoring work in progress to make more headway (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the `m_tx_relay` pointer itself?)",

Given the limits overlap a little (extra outbounds vs feelers), and what to do when you have extra peers requires looking at other data anyway, I'm not sure that's very convincing though.\r\n\r\nHmm, how much we \"trust\" a connection might change over the course of a connection in future if we allow random inbound peers to authenticate themselves to us... So I guess that leaves me thinking that we should have `const m_conn_type` representing our purpose in having the connection? (Different purposes meaning substantial changes in the protocol state machine -- eg, blocks only we deliberately opt out of tx and addr relay even if we otherwise support both, feelers we disconnect after verack, addrfetch we disconnect after getting addresses, inbounds we have different delays for and send VERSION later)\r\n\r\n> (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the m_tx_relay pointer itself?)\r\n\r\nMaybe?
