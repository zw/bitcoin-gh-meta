The bridge is not enabled by default in the Java I2P Router, and the relevant info is somewhat difficult to find in its documentation.\r\n\r\n2. Remove a duplicate sentence and link (the preceding paragraph begins with the same sentence and link).\r\n\r\n3. Simplify the router options:\r\n\r\n    - the Java I2P router and i2pd are the two routers have been heavily tested with Bitcoin Core and are what node operators and node software packages are using\r\n\r\n    - [i2p-zero](https://github.com/i2p-zero/i2p-zero) hasn't been updated since July 2021 and its last release was in December 2020\r\n\r\n    - the other routers in the wikipedia page are niche and I haven't heard anyone report using them",
