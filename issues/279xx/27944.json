Except for slightly different logging behaviour in \"test: store utxocache events\" and \"test: log sanity check assertion failures\", this is a refactor PR, removing unnecessary code and (imo) making it more readable and maintainable.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for each change is in the corresponding commit message.\r\n\r\nNote: except for \"test: store utxocache events\" (which relies on its parent, and I separated into two commits because we may want the parent but not the child), all commits are stand-alone and I'm okay with dropping one/multiple commits if they turn out to be controversial or undesired.",
