What I was trying to protect against was checking the number of references in one instruction, and permitting another thread to increase the `refCount` in the meantime before we remove the node in the subsequent lines. But, it looks like we don't have any functions which would increase the `refCount` during normal operation (only incremented on new connections), so probably unnecessary here.\r\n\r\nIf I'm honest, I kind of prefer this belt-and-suspenders way myself, but would be easily persuaded that it's superfluous or worse than current behaviour (useless extra locking).\r\n\r\nI felt a bit nevous about nesting `m_disconnect_mutex` inside of `m_nodes_mutex`, but it seemed like it was slightly preferable to just locking `m_nodes_mutex` for the whole of `DisconnectNodes()` as that's used in many other operations. I don't think there is any way `StopNodes()` and `DisconnectNodes()` can lock each other here though. Would you agree?",

      "body" : "I acknowledge the problem described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27843: `ThreadI2PAcceptIncoming()` calls `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()`. The latter checks `nInbound >= nMaxInbound` and calls `AttemptToEvictConnection()` if that is true, but the eviction is done asynchronously - `AttemptToEvictConnection()` only marks it for disconnect and leaves the actual disconnection and socket closure to another thread for a later time (`ThreadSocketHandler()`). Until that other thread actually does the disconnect, `ThreadI2PAcceptIncoming()` may call `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` way too many times, ending up with N excess connections above 125 (the new I2P ones) and N other connections marked for disconnect, but not disconnected until `ThreadSocketHandler()` calls `DisconnectNodes()`.\r\n\r\nI intended `ThreadI2PAcceptIncoming()` to be just low level socket-accept function, an alternative to `AcceptConnection()` (which may be better named as `AcceptConnectionTCP()`). And then all the higher level logic (e.g. capping the number of connections) to happen in `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()`. It indeed checks `nMaxInbound` but does the disconnect asynchronously. It works for `AcceptConnection()` because the async happens to be in the same thread. But it will not work if that is decoupled or if a new one is added later to accept connections by other means (other than TCP and I2P/SAM).\r\n\r\nI did not look deeply in the code in this PR, but I gather it drags some high level logic (cap number of connections) to `ThreadI2PAcceptIncoming()`. This seems suboptimal because now the higher level logic is in two places. If a new accept method is added, then it would have to be replicated there too. And `ThreadI2PAcceptIncoming()` becomes not just low level socket-accept function.\r\n\r\nWhat about changing `AttemptToEvictConnection()` to disconnect synchronously? It is called from just one place. Something like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- i/src/net.cpp\r\n+++ w/src/net.cpp\r\n@@ -927,12 +927,13 @@ bool CConnman::AttemptToEvictConnection()\r\n     }\r\n     LOCK(m_nodes_mutex);\r\n     for (CNode* pnode : m_nodes) {\r\n         if (pnode->GetId() == *node_id_to_evict) {\r\n             LogPrint(BCLog::NET, \"selected %s connection for eviction peer=%d; disconnecting\\n\", pnode->ConnectionType\r\n             pnode->fDisconnect = true;\r\n+            DisconnectNodes();\r\n             return true;\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n     return false;\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(modulo trying to avoid the recursive lock of `m_nodes_mutex` and maybe some optimization because `DisconnectNodes()` iterates on all nodes and in this case we know which node is marked for disconnect).",

I was experimenting with whether `m_nodes` would work better as a vector of `share_ptr`, meaning they could be added and removed from `m_nodes` (and `m_nodes_disconnected`) much more safely from the perspective of other threads...\r\n\r\nIf you are also interested in this approach, I'd be curious to know what you thought of it. Althought \"cleaner\" in the end I think the change is too expensive for too-little benefit...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/willcl-ark/bitcoin/tree/2023-07_shared-ptr-cnode",

      "body" : "Yes! I was thinking about the same! We are doing some manual refcounting here which is creating all kinds of headaches and is prone to bugs. There is a neat solution already for this `std::shared_ptr`. Long term, this is a must have IMO.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the size of the initial PR, I guess you can just change `CConnman::m_nodes` and `CConnman::m_nodes_disconnected` from `std::vector<CNode*>` to `std::vector<CNodeRef>` and the needed changes to get that to compile and work.\r\n\r\nLater I think we don't even need `m_nodes_disconnected` because we can do the `FinalizeNode()` from the `CNode` destructor. For example - give the `CNode` constructor a callback function that it will invoke from its destructor. Then just remove the `shared_ptr` objects from `m_nodes` or elsewhere and when their refcount drops to zero the destructor will be called and it will call `FinalizeNode()`.\r\n\r\nPS [2023-07_shared-ptr-cnode](https://github.com/willcl-ark/bitcoin/tree/2023-07_shared-ptr-cnode) does not look too bad.",
