      "body" : "Here's a more concrete proposal:  We already have `fSyncStarted` in the node state of `main.cpp`.  This is set to true when we start requesting headers from a particular node, so we can use it to *not* request headers from this node also following an inv message.  In addition, we have to reset the flag to false once we receive a headers message that does not have the maximum size - currently, it is never reset.\r\n\r\nAre there any problems with this approach or is it ok?  This is straight-forward to implement and fixes, as far as my preliminary testing goes, the issue.",

Did you do any further investigation into this issue after the revert?\r\n\r\nI'm currently facing the problem of duplicate headers download while working on Dash. The amount of received data while doing the initial headers-only sync is approx. 10 times as much as I would expect, resulting in a pretty bad delay until actual block download starts. My debugging sessions have shown that there are alot of duplicate headers received, so it must be this same issue.",
