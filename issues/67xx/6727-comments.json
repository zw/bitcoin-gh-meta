Either this means a bug in LevelDB, in the operating system, or\nin the hardware.\n\nOr something we don't know of course...\n\nJust to make it clear: the software is designed to not cause corruption\nduring crashing. Personally, I have never ever seen a corruption, even when\npower loss occurs during synchronization. That doesn't mean there is no bug\nof course in some situations, but it's not as simple as changing the write\npattern.\n",
