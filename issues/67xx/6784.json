   "body" : "Hi,\r\njust noticed that my 0.11.0-win64 full node running on laptop becomes unresponsive, drops connections (both p2p and rpc), hogs memory (may take up to 4GB out of total 6).\r\n![bitcoind](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12157216/10380123/ee88bc9a-6e09-11e5-9df1-dcfd6d3ac8a1.png)\r\nIt restores normal operation after a while but then again becomes unresponsive. I restarted bitcoind and even spent a few days to reindex DB, with no luck. Does this mean that my laptops 5400 RPM HDD is not fast enough to run full node? Or does it mean that it is a bug? bitcoin.conf is almost empty. Only rpc username, password and non-standard network port number there. Thanks for any clues.\r\nvay",
