Nor is the goal to prevent any specific type or kind of transaction, spam or otherwise.   The goal is only to prevent particularly constructed chains of transactions which would serve to break critical functionality of the network.  Such chains are only likely constructed for the particular purpose of attacking the entire Bitcoin system, however, the limits proposed to prevent these attacks may inadvertently restrict non-attack transactions.   I'm just trying to be as transparent as possible by acknowledging that 2.6% of recent transactions would either have to have been delayed until some of their ancestors were included in blocks or constructed from different utxos if these limits had already been in place.\r\n",

There are attacks which can cause the mempools of full nodes to become almost permanently unusuable, which would prevent transaction relay and basically bring the network to a halt.  How low we have to make these limits to prevent that may not be an exact science.   The good thing is that if we do decide to start with a higher limit than 25, and these attacks are seen in the wild, its only a command line argument to change it.  But as we've seen with the minimum relay fee and the stress tests, its still an issue if people have to bring down their nodes and restart them with different parameters to respond to the attack.",

Completely independent of taariq's use case, but similar in that chains of txs are created and submitted to the mempool together without waiting for sequential block confirmation of each tx in the chain.\r\n\r\nDue to signature constraints, our multiple steps cannot be coalesced into a single transaction for publication. (Coalescing could be possible with improvements to sigHash capabilities) Therefore, we end up with multiple transactions in a chain which are all submitted to the peer network together.\r\n\r\nIn our current implementation, these chains can be 3 to 4 levels deep per \"user transaction\".  However, if the blockchain is taking 20 minutes to  produce the next block, a user initiating multiple \"user transactions\" (buy x, then buy y, then buy z) in that 20 minutes could build on that unspent chain.  The additional operations are not strictly linear - subsequent operations would spend the change outputs of the previous operation's root transaction, forming a tree of chained txs.  A set of 3 operations would form a tree with a max depth of 7 and a total node count of 12.\r\n\r\nThe \"sendmany\" RPC function is of no use to me because it only works within the limits of the reference implementation wallet - single signature outputs. Our system is built on multisignature wallets. We run off-the-shelf bitcoind full nodes, but we never use the wallet or address functions.\r\n",

But yes, if there is too much resistance to 25/25, we might have to start with higher limits.  I think node performance should be reasonable with 50/100 but I worry about attacks.  Maybe there is some middle ground where some nodes run with higher limits and some lower.  Highly chained txs would only be relayed through the nodes with higher limits, but in the event of the attack the lower limit nodes would keep relay open for the vast majority of txs.\r\n\r\n",

Not so much to entirely replace the tx chains we have, but to reduce the number of outputs necessary to pay network fees across the chain, and improve the all-or-none granularity of the tx set for inclusion in a block.\r\n\r\nI gave a slightly more specific example of my use case on the bitcoin-dev list a few weeks ago: http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010569.html   Basically, a brokered escrow transaction involving 3 parties where the seller and the buyer never communicate directly.\r\n\r\nYes, I am aware of and concerned about transaction maleability. I'm counting on BIP62 to significantly reduce that risk. I believe the txs we generate are already BIP62 compliant. We also compute a signature-free hash of every transaction as an alternate txid so that we can at least recognize our txs in the blockchain even if their scripts have been tweaked in transit. Any issued txs downstream from that altered tx would have to be redone, of course, which is a pain in the neck and extremely inconvenient to all involved.",
