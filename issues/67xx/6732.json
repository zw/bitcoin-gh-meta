What matters is that DER signatures are correctly parsed, and secp256k1 crypto is implemented correctly (as well as the other functions we use from OpenSSL, such as random number generation)\r\n\r\nThis means that effectively, using LibreSSL is not a larger risk than using another version of OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nRemove the specific check for LibreSSL. This makes it much easier to build on platforms that use LibreSSL by default.\r\n\r\nIncludes the still-relevant part of #6729: make sure CHECK_HEADER(ec.h) is called using the right CXXFLAGS, not CFLAGS (as AC_LANG is c++).",
