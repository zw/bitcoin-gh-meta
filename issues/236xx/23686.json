   "body" : "The functional test interface_bitcoin_cli.py currently fails on master branch, if descriptor wallets are used (argument `--descriptors`), see #23684. This is due to the fact that different change output types are used for created transactions (P2WPKH for legacy wallets, P2TR for descriptor wallets; the former doesn't have a ScriptPubKeyMan for bech32m), resulting in different tx sizes and hence also fees. Fix this by explicitely setting the output type via passing both `-addresstype=bech32` and `-changetype=bech32` as argument. The former would not be needed by now, but makes the test more deterministic and avoids a failure if bech32m becomes the default address type.\r\n\r\nFixes #23684, should also pave the way for #23682.",
