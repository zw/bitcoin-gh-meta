It's an important comment especially for future readers intending to use it for fork detection.\r\n\r\n\r\n(not related) I've changed the code to use ToString instead of std::to_string to avoid locale linter errors.\r\n\r\nWhat do you say on changing the start of the description \"Execute command when a wallet transaction changes\" to \"Asynchronously execute command when a wallet transaction changes\"? It's true also before this commit. Would help to highlight potential tradeoffs for future users.",

Now the request passes all the CI tests and is ready to merge.",
