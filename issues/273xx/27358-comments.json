When\n+verifying binary downloads, you (the end user) decide which of these public keys you\n+trust and then use that trust model to evaluate the signature on a file that contains\n+hashes of the release binaries. The downloaded binaries are then hashed and compared to\n+the signed checksum file.\n \n-It first checks if the signature passes, and then downloads the files specified in the file, and checks if the hashes of these files match those that are specified in the signature file.\n+First, you have to figure out which public keys to recognize. Browse the [list of frequent\n+builder-keys](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/tree/main/builder-keys) and\n+decide which of these keys you would like to trust. For each key you want to trust, you\n+must obtain that key for your local GPG installation.\n \n-The script returns 0 if everything passes the checks. It returns 1 if either the signature check or the hash check doesn't pass. If an error occurs the return value is 2.\n+You can obtain these keys by\n+  - through a browser using a key server (e.g. keyserver.ubuntu.com),\n+  - manually using the `gpg --keyserver <url> --recv-keys <key>` command, or\n+  - you can run the packaged `verifybinaries.py ... --import-keys` script to\n+    have it automatically retrieve unrecognized keys.\n \n+#### Usage\n \n+This script attempts to download the checksum file (`SHA256SUMS`) and corresponding\n+signature file `SHA256SUMS.asc` from https://bitcoincore.org and https://bitcoin.org.\n+\n+It first checks if the checksum file is valid based upon a plurality of signatures, and\n+then downloads the release files specified in the checksum file, and checks if the\n+hashes of the release files are as expected.\n+\n+If we encounter pubkeys in the signature file that we do not recognize, the script\n+can prompt the user as to whether they'd like to download the pubkeys.

So I'm not sure it makes sense to allow the user to use the same type of filter for `bin`.\r\n\r\nShould we just go back to requiring the user to specify the bins? Downloading to a clean dir and using a wildcard should still work for tooling I think. @TheBlueMatt ?",
