The block storage (including being told about new blocks, holding the chain (or not, if SPV)) will be hidden behind CHub, as seen by p2p and wallet.  A CHub can then callback to a CBlockStore/CSPVBlockStore/etc.  Eventually, you could even run p2p and wallet clients in separate processes for additional security, that is the long-long-long term goal.\nIn terms of exposing threads, that is more for added functionality later which cleans up the API a bit (when you need to run n regular threads, and possibly multiple callback threads).",

      "body" : "I had originally made CHubListener do that as well, but, as it turns out, we only ever call EmitTransaction from CWalletTx::AcceptWalletTransaction (which calls EmitTransaction on each supporting transaction first), and making the hub pointer public so that CWalletTx can call pwallet->phub->EmitTransaction seems kinda ugly to me.  Thus a CHubClient would be unused (currently), but ACK on the idea probably for a P2P/Net class.  One could move AcceptWalletTransaction code to CWallet, as its only used twice, but I find that to also be ugly...  In the end, since having more than one CHub in a given process is entirely unsupported, it seems cleaner to just use the global phub, but it wouldnt be hard to pass a phub pointer to CWalletTx::EmitTransaction if we wanted to support that (though a CHubClient::phub should be private, whereas that would require it be protected, so, again, I find that ugly...)",
