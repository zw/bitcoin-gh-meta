In case of an transaction to yourself, your balance doesn't change so this is 0 (or -0.0x in case of fee). You can view the details such as size of the transaction in the transaction details (double click).\n\n2) The client regards this as \"change\" which is never shown. Every transaction that doesn't spend the entire balance of a txout generates change, so showing this as transaction to yourself would result in a lot of noise (and thus confusion).\n",

You have to look up the tx-id on eg blockexplorer to figure out from where to where the transfer went. (I'm talking about weeks/months later obviously). Since I cannot add a comment to a tx, I have to track those in an extra file.\n\n2) I realize that normally change is not shown. However, this is not an automatic change, but a tx I created manually. It is more confusing to have a tx I created missing in the tx list. Especially when every other \"tx to self\" gets listed. I intentionally sent the entire balance of one address to two addresses to avoid an auto-change address.\n\nAs a possible solution auto-change should go back to the same address where it originated from.\n",

I'll have to track those tx separately for now.\n\n2) Seeing that the client displays \"to self\" transactions (when moving all coins from address A to B) I assumed that it would do the same when only a part of the coins is moved from A to B while most goes to another user C. Like, one line for A to C and one for A to B. I thought that there's maybe some sort of \"donotshow\" flag or something.\n\nWould it be complex to add an option to let the user select whether to use a new address or the input address for storing change?",
