The gitian scripts don't yet support it, but if we ever need it, it wont be hard.  We cant just run from the gitian-updater in the Bitcoin dir, as windows doesn't let you replace exes while they are running (AFAIK).\n\n3) for stand-alone users, they will get the update available popup, and then an error about missing gitian-updater, which I think is the appropriate result.  You could update their installs too, but I dont really like touching a stand-alone copy.  Also, if the update succeeds, it will update the windows registry with the new version installed, which defeats the purpose of the stand-alone portable version.",

After shutdown or before next startup or... ?\r\n+ gitian-updater... fetches a new binary and signatures, then makes sure the binary corresponds to the signatures and that the signatures ?match a list of built-in signatures ?\r\n\r\nA discussion of possible attacks (MITM intercepts fetching of 'latestversion'... binary on the server gets replaced... are there any other interesting attacks?) would also be helpful.\r\n\r\nI'd find that very useful, and I think so would users who are going to be very suspicious of this feature.\r\n",

Win32 versions of Bitcoin-Qt will download http://bitcoin.org/latestversion.txt and compare its contents with the version currently in use.\r\nIf an update is found, a dialog box appears informing the user that a new update is available (possibly with a note that the version currently in use is considered somehow \"insecure\").\r\nIff the user decides to upgrade, gitian-updater is launched which then downloads the new version (via a hardcoded path) and verifies signatures.\r\nIf the newly downloaded version has valid signatures from at least 3 developers, the installed files are replaced with the new version and, when the process is complete, the user is notified and Bitcoin-Qt is restarted.\r\nNote that the auto-upgrade system will not work on non-installed versions of Bitcoin, however the upgrade available dialog will still appear.\r\n\r\nPotential Attacks:\r\n* If bitcoin.org is compromised or otherwise gets bogus data, it is possible that the attacker can make users see the upgrade available dialog box, however, even if the user opts to upgrade, the process will simply download the \"new version\" and fail when verifying signatures, deleting the new data.\r\n* There has been discussion of making gitian-updater quarantine new upgrades for some period, during which a list of people can sign \"NACKs\" which signify that they have found an issue in the upgrade.  Though there was some consensus on implementing something like this system, there was never any implementation and a consensus on exact details was never reached (AFAIR).",
