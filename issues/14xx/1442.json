   "body" : "No, I'm not kidding. As is a program to interoperate with Bitcoin needs to use BerkeleyDB because the \"Irreplaceable \" data part is stored in BerkeleyDB format. New operations could simply be written after the last row \"overwriting\" previous versions (so I have key A with public key B and description C. The public/private parts are immutable. If I want to change its description I can: 1) insert a new record of type \"new description\" that changes the old description or 2) reinsert the same row with a different description) and if there are too many \"dead\" rows (or if the keys need to be re-encrypted) the entire file could be rewritten. An XML file doesn't have this property: it can easily get corrupted (but then it's normally quite easy to repair it if you know what you are doing) and to append some information you have to \"reopen\" the last element (or we could write an XML fragment without the root element. It would be the same, but XML are a little larger). The file would be written in UTF8 with some characters escaped (but these are details). It would be a little bigger than it's now, but at least it would be easy for the user to cut and paste the keys in and out.",
