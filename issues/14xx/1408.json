   "body" : "Due to several changes in master that would require rethinking decisions made in the second revision of CBlockStore (#771) and thus very large code changes to rebase, I decided it was better to redo and manually rebase and re-commit the parts that remain relevant, also decreasing the total size of the changes to just those required to get CHub working on master.  Some of the more disturbing changes can be added later after merge.\n\nThis is early in the process, but I thought I'd get it in the queue and let people review the commits as they come in and give feedback, if they wish.",
