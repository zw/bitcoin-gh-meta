I run application that keeps scanning for transactions using xmlrpc\n* Here is debug.log: https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxBlvkNJOOeXRXFDN0tPU0V3ejA . I cannot pinpoint anything specific\n* I am not sure how to do this on windows. Is there any way I could load symbols into visual studio? Or, is there is another debugger I could use on windows\n* I would be happy to use a different version, but they are all affected by the same flaw, that will not allow me rename the labels correctly (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1231). So I have to keep patching the source code myself and recompiling it\n",
