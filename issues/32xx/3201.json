Specically, when a miner learns\r\nof competing branches of the same length, it should propagate all of them, and\r\nchoose which one to mine on uniformly at random. In the case of two branches\r\nof length 1, as discussed in Section 4, this would result in half the nodes (in\r\nexpectancy) mining on the pool's branch and the other half mining on the other\r\nbranch. This yields \r\nY = 1/2, which in turn yields a threshold of 1/4.\r\nEach miner implementing our change decreases the selsh pool's ability to\r\nincrease through control of data propagation. This improvement is independent\r\nof the adoption of the change at other miners, therefore it does not require a\r\nhard fork. This change to the protocol does not introduce new vulnerabilities to\r\nthe protocol: Currently, when there are two branches of equal length, the choice\r\nof each miner is arbitrary, eectively determined by the network topology and latency. Our change explicitly randomizes this arbitrary choice, and therefore\r\ndoes not introduce new vulnerabilities.\" (Eyal & Sirer 2013)",
