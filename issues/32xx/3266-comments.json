This will just check if the address you have pasted into the send coins entry address field exists in the address book already, and display a warning message if it does.\r\n\r\nThis will also display the error message if you create a receiving address from the request dialog and then try to send a payment there. I'm not sure if that is a problem because users probably aren't doing that too often.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the label field is not cleared when a new address without a label is pasted, the UI displays the old label so I fixed that as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/CryptAxe/bitcoin/commit/0698a278274c32b2b90901561d1f8f510cd4890a",

Consider the scenario where a user gets a loan, and saves the repayment address in his address book for later.

So some explicit flag is needed (it can be set on the address book entry went it is used for sending).\r\n3. \"Address reuse is not recommended!\" is too soft and unclear.
