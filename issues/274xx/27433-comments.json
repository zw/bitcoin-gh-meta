      "body" : "The \"rules\" field was introduced in #7935. It's not specified in [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) which describe the expected behaviour of `getblocktemplate`. But then in [BIP 145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki) for segwit it's assumed to be there. I'm guessing something in between is documented in Stratum software?\r\n\r\nHere's [an example](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool/src/73f560cf3144f824823077c1b9e1663d89823ed7/src/bitcoin.c#lines-127:135) of how it's used by pool software. There's also some documentation through bug reports, e.g. #17946. My understanding is that `!` means that it's unsafe to mine without understanding the rule.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me how it is intented to be used, both as an argument and in the results. I'm also not sure how to interpret this wording in BIP 145:\r\n\r\n> The '!' rule prefix MUST be enabled on the \"segwit\" rule for templates including transactions with witness data.\r\n\r\nFor 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a I have assumed that the consumer of this RPC may care about it, so we keep `!segwit` in the result. I've the read the above sentence as referring only to the result of the RPC. With this commit it doesn't matter if you set it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @luke-jr",

You just don't have to specify it: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27433/commits/edd00677dbddd5b40fa3d2954e8cb04fcd8359f4#diff-ccc24453c13307f815879738d3bf00eec351417537fbf10dde1468180cacd2f1R821-R822\r\n\r\nWe do the same thing with `csv`.\r\n\r\n>> Two recent F2Pool blocks violated the sigops limit. Both by 3. I suspect they were not using getblocktemplate.\r\n\r\n> This PR is unlikely to have avoided it, then.\r\n\r\nI've since learned that they do use it, but with patches.\r\n\r\n> These are non-standard\r\n\r\nDo you mean BIP 22/23? It says:\r\n\r\n> getblocktemplate MUST return a JSON Object containing the following keys\r\n\r\nIt doesn't say there can't be extra fields, though I can see how people can screw up by not implementing from the spec, but rather from the JSON RPC. I can add a comment to the help pointing out they're not BIP 22/23 fields. Or hide them behind a debug option. It's useful to know these totals with resorting to `jq` magic.",

I'll unrebase and pick the test if that PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\nI dropped 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a: it's still necessary for the (mining software) client to tell us it supports SegWit. This is merely a checkbox now.\r\n\r\nIn the context of dropping `segwit` as a required rule I wrote:\r\n\r\n> We do the same thing with `csv`.\r\n\r\nI guess the argument here is that, unlike `segwit`, the `csv` (and `taproot`) soft fork is safe to use by a miner if they simply use the response from `getblocktemplate` without modifying it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extra `sigops`, `coinbase_reserved_sigops` and `coinbase_reserved_weight` field in the result is now tucked behind a `debug` argument.\r\n\r\nHope that addresses @luke-jr's concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the debug-only `coinbase_reserved_` arguments are just repeating a constant`*`, and the `sigops` field is straight-forward to calculate by iterating over all transactions, we can use the `debug` argument in the future to add additional stuff. Things that aid in anticipating what the next block should look like, e.g. for the [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space) audit feature and @0xB10C's [miningpool.observer](https://miningpool.observer). For example we could expand the `transactions` result with a timestamp of when our mempool first saw it.\r\n\r\nI could however still drop the fields from 09fbc4cbfa7b7d86e6da00a737317151088b4b6c and ac3fcb240af8ef96d4e348548995ec1a536ff531, but keep the `Assume`.\r\n\r\n`*` = given that F2pool shot itself in the foot with custom patches, trying to squeeze out a few more sigops in their blocks, maybe we should make this configurable.",

We've seen in practice that miners sometimes patch template generation code, so additional checks can be helpful. But this particular check would not have worked: the patch set `nBlockSigOpsCost` to `1`, which after SegWit should have been adjusted to 4. Since we have no way to check how many sigops are added to the coinbase, afaik there's nothing we can do catch a bug like that.\r\n\r\n",
