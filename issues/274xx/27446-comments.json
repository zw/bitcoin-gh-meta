People want to use custom signets to have their own test networks, I don't see why we should disallow having custom block times. The main concern being people don't copy-paste the param into their conf and have troubles syncing, doesn't seem like a valid one given that they could do the same for `-signetchallenge`. I understand that it would cause a failure on block 1 vs block 2016, but normally those blocks are synced near instantly anyways. ",

Doing it in memory (tmpfs, Linux, `prune=550`).\r\n\r\nThis makes me realize with a practical experiment that a signed block is enough to be accepted by a node on Signet (i.e. it will not be rejected by a node for breaking some other rules as I originally thought), even without this patch.\r\n\r\nSo as for me, even though this is far from simulating mainnet, it looks fun for playing. You never know what may make things click for someone else. By the way, I will surely not run any such node on my old hardware, but experimentation and play may lead to bridging the gaps between generations and keep the kids playing near the base.\r\n\r\nACK d8434da",

As these are consensus parameters, forgetting to set the option correctly will result in eventual consensus failure which is generally only resolved by nuking the data directory. This may garner additional and unnecessary issues being opened in this repo which we generally don't want to deal with.\r\n\r\nA key difference between `-signetchallenge` and the proposed `-signetblocktime` is that if `-signetchallenge` is incorrect, no blocks will be downloaded and the `signet` datadir is still usable for any signet, whereas if `-signetblocktime` is incorrect, some blocks will be downloaded before a failure condition that leaves the datadir in a bad state.\r\n\r\nThis brings up a related issue in that we can't have multiple signets in the same base datadir. All signets use the `signet` datadir, so any change of parameter may result in a bad chainstate for that signet node.\r\n\r\nI think we should instead look at implementing a more robust multiple signet solution that allows for multiple configurable consensus rules in a clean and simple way since clearly that's desired. Ideally we would have a single parameter that contains all of the rules being configured rather than having multiple for each rule. We should also make datadirs specific to each set of rules, ideally in a deterministic way.",

People want to use custom signets to have their own test networks, I don't see why we should disallow having custom block times.\r\n\r\nThere have always been plenty of people who'd like an easy way to create altcoins with faster block times, and that's a fine thing to do if you're maintaining your own codebase, but the purpose of including signet in this repo is about making it easier to test *bitcoin*, not about building your own altcoin with different parameters. How does using a 30s signet do anything but encourage developers to build software that will only work well on altcoins (like liquid and ethereum) with more frequent blocks than bitcoin?\r\n\r\nI mean, I understand where you're coming from -- waiting for a block is annoying, and papering over it for a test network is really easy, which just adds to the frustration.\r\n\r\nYou can get a similar result without changing consensus too, either having the miner pause when it would otherwise mine an empty block, and do a burst when transactions actually come in, or making use of the timewarp bug, and just having blocks occur at whatever rate you want. But both those have the same problem: they're giving you behaviour that you won't see on mainnet.\r\n\r\nBut if you really just want \"instant channel setup\" you **can** actually do that in a way that is suitable for mainnet though -- just do \"zeroconf\" channels (https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/910), where the faucet opens a channel with the user and immediately pushes X sats to them. You could even open a channel with a balance of 40X, and push X sats to them every day for a month to \"reward\" people that actually keep their node running...",

As these are consensus parameters, forgetting to set the option correctly will result in eventual consensus failure which is generally only resolved by nuking the data directory. This may garner additional and unnecessary issues being opened in this repo which we generally don't want to deal with.\r\n\r\n-- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27446#issuecomment-1513814497\r\n\r\nI think the concerns are valid. However, I think this won't happen often so shouldn't be much of a concern _right now_. There is only one additional parameter added now which can't be used on it's own. So if someone is setting up a signet and does not know about this new parameter, he is probably already using the correct parameters.\r\n\r\nIf someone is setting up a signet and knows about this new parameter, he will most likely know to set this parameter correctly.\r\n\r\nAnd even if not: I assume throwing away all the signet data isn't that much of a problem anyway? Wouldn't this \"eventual consensus failure\" happen pretty early? If I understood @benthecarman correctly, this will happen in block 2016 (difficulty adjustment period) which seems to be early enough:\r\n\r\n> The main concern being people don't copy-paste the param into their conf and have troubles syncing, doesn't seem like a valid one given that they could do the same for -signetchallenge. I understand that it would cause a failure on block 1 vs block 2016, but normally those blocks are synced near instantly anyways.\r\n\r\n-- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27446#issuecomment-1505704805\r\n\r\nSo I think this concern is more relevant if we go further into this direction regarding signet parameters as mentioned:\r\n\r\n> **If we want to allow for more configurable signet consensus rules**\r\n\r\nEssentially, I agree with this comment:\r\n\r\n> > So in the end the parameter would need to be distributed the same way as signetchallenge\r\n>\r\n> I had similar thoughts and think eventually we may want to introduce a more encompassing (and upgradeable) parameter such as -signetconfig in which all signet consensus parameters are encoded (currently just challenge and blocktime), but I think starting with the current modular approach is fine given that it's signet.\r\n\r\n-- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27446#issuecomment-1505365250\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> if you want to test non-bitcoin behaviours, why modify bitcoin to do it?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't call this change \"non-bitcoin behaviour\".

(If this were on mainnet, presumably you would have deposited $1500 cash to justify the 0.05 BTC and you'll want to recover the $1500 cash, but again, it's the same process to do that whether the channel failed or if they declined to open a channel in the first place) \r\n\r\nHowever if you create invoices for incoming payments, and resolve them prior to the channel being confirmed, that could result in loss of income, and the zeroconf-selective plugin above doesn't do anything to prevent that. But it's signet, so it's easy to just say \"YOLO\" and not worry; and even on mainnet, if you were in a position to recover the $1500, this may just mean you'll now be wanting to recover $1600 from the same company/group instead, and is not a meaningfully different problem.\r\n\r\nLikewise if you route payments from a zeroconf channel through some other channel, that would allow stealing funds from that other channel -- the funds go out on the other channel, and the funds that looked like they were coming in on the zeroconf channel disappear when the channel never confirms. (This is a good reason not to use `any` above, even on signet).\r\n\r\nFixing those special cases (ie, rejecting incoming funds on a zeroconf channel on the receiver's side) might be enough for this approach to work on mainnet and avoid hour long waits there too, if you can establish a reasonable level of trust when setting up the channel (the \"faucet\" wants to actually get the $1500 and not be chargebacked after losing 0.05 BTC; the receiver wants to be able to go to the police to recover the $1500 if the channel doesn't open).",

It helps with development, especially for second-layer protocols and apps, because it vastly reduces the time you need to wait for things to happen.\r\n\r\nI don't think any developer using 30-second block times would be unaware that mainnet has 10-minute block times, and I very much doubt any developers will fail to consider mainnet block times in their apps. If somehow they do, they'll quickly discover their error as soon as they deploy to mainnet. In this case it's obviously the fault of the developers themselves, or at most the fault of the signet operators. I don't see how this could possibly lead to people creating issues in this repo.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I'm missing something...",
