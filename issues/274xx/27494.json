All signets use the signet datadir, so any change of parameter may result in a bad chainstate for that signet node.\r\n> \r\n> I think we should instead look at implementing a more robust multiple signet solution that allows for multiple configurable consensus rules in a clean and simple way since clearly that's desired. Ideally we would have a single parameter that contains all of the rules being configured rather than having multiple for each rule. We should also make datadirs specific to each set of rules, ideally in a deterministic way.\r\n",
