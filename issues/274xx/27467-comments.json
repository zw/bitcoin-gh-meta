My reaction is then to ignore them - don't spend _my_ time on them if _I_ think it is not worth it. But I don't try to impose my opinion on others\r\n\r\nI agree with you that at a project / maintenance level we should be neutral about \"I don't think this PR is a good use of effort but I can't point out any actual problems with it\" review feedback. If a PR has sufficient review and no substantive technical objections, it should be merged regardless of these comments.\r\n\r\nBut I think these comments are really valuable for helping people decide what to spend time on, and I personally want to encourage more not less \"I don't think this PR is useful\" comments. Sometimes a PR is more useful than it initially appears, and more discussion could help clarify that. Other times, maybe the PR is not really very useful, and having the feedback could help the contributor decide not to put more work into the PR, and avoid having them wonder for months if the PR isn't getting review because it isn't interesting, or is too hard to understand, or just wasn't noticed.\r\n",
