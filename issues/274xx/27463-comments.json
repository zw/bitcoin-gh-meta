As deployed today by some LSPs where both incoming/outgoing HTLCs are allowed during the pending confirmation period, there is a risk in case of mempool congestions of the inbound funding transaction not confirming before the timelock of the offered HTLC output expires. The current nversion=3 size is 1000 vb which might be too low if LSPs would like to do batching of 0-confs. Note, I think all the pinning risks are not the same for 0-conf funding transactions than for time-sensitive confirmation of LN commitment+HTLCs transactions.\r\n\r\nMentioning 0-conf, and as raised on [#27643](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26525#issuecomment-1473067644) at some point in the development cycle of nversion=3 it might be good communication practice to publish than all 0confs users might have to upgrade their mempool monitoring stuff to reject nversion=3, or chain of transactions with them, as otherwise genuine upgrade to the version of Core with package relay might lower their security.\r\n\r\nFor Lightning, there is the question if the p2p package format is flexible enough for the Lightning channels to apply \"new mempool rules\" on \"old in-flight channnel type\". Like backward compatible effect of the mempools rules without off-chain channels having to cooperate on-resigning transactions. I believe that would require a Lightning node to sign the p2p package with the same pubkey than used with the channel (though I start to think we might have multiple types of backward/forward compatible application of mempools rules like the ones mentioned in [#25038](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1405944407), like there is some matrix ?)\r\n\r\nFor the second-layers listed, I'm just considering the ones which have a) a mature specification and b) some substantial deployment though should we consider more second-layers or multi-party applications like vaults (non-deployed) ?\r\n\r\nFrom a reviewer viewpoint, I think it could be very valuable if you can highlight the 2/3 PRs or mail posts you consider as top of the stack for reviews ? Thanks for a package-relay context-tracking meta-issue.\r\n\r\n(Feel free to integrate what you find relevant of this comment to ease context tracking of package relay as a project)",

      "body" : "From a reviewing standpoint on #27742, I think it would benefit if the release aim for current package version (BIP331 + nversion=3 policy regime) is explicitly bounded to Lightning time-sensitive confirmation flows, especially in matters of DoS protection:\r\n- broadcast of revoked transaction output spend\r\n- broadcast of a commitment transaction with pending HTLC outputs and its associated second-stage transactions\r\n\r\nI think this covers the most sensitive Lightning flows impacted by the pinning attacks mentioned as a design goal by BIP331. However this left of out considerations the following multi-party contract protocols and subsidiary Lightning flows:\r\n- submarine swaps e.g peerswap\r\n- LN dual-funding and splicing (package relay has been discussed as a griefing mitigation on the lightning dev mailing list iirc)\r\n- Taprooted wallet with time-sensitive script path\r\n\r\nI think this is opportune to say so on the mailing list and therefore avoid multi-party applications or contracting protocols having to complaint than this deployment of package relay doesnât fit their use-case (kind of like we have with the mempoolfullrbf debate). Beyond, I would say itâs valuable to announce latest BIP331 (minor) changes, if it does change something for the p2p network, that we would have missed from the Bitcoin Core-side.",

      "body" : "There have been discussions on what package validation and RBF rules will look like in a post-cluster mempool world. #26711 either doesn't work with cluster mempool or should not be considered until after cluster mempool. #26711 supports certain types of package submission that we might not be able to continue to support with cluster mempool depending on what approach is taken. There are different ideas on how to consider subsets of packages to accept when it doesn't make sense to take all or none. IIUC the approach taken in #26711 (which is to do subpackage evaluation) no longer has conceptual support which is why I closed it.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is a circular dependency between cluster mempool and package relay. (1) We want cluster mempool before package RBF since it allows us to assess incentive compatibility much more easily. (2) Cluster mempool requires the removal of CPFP carve out in order to switch from ancestor/descendant-based package limits to cluster limits. But there are people who rely on CPFP carve out for bumping presigned transactions; we need to build a replacement (i.e. package relay + package RBF).\r\n\r\nSo the new plan of attack is to first create 1-parent-1-child package relay, including package RBF for v3 transactions. This allows the users of CPFP carve out to switch, thus allowing us to remove CPFP carve out and then add cluster mempool. This also allows us to defer the decision-making on what package evaluation and package RBF will look like in a post-cluster mempool world.",
