However it is no longer used (?), is bad for privacy, and we can simplify our P2P code by removing it.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to guess mempool transactions using `getdata` by maintaining mempool with no restrictions. I dont think sharing mempool affects privacy particularly in this case as its behind `NetPermissionFlags::Mempool flag`. If privacy needs to be improved at mempool level it should be possible to make all transactions look similar until included in block except fee rate however that is out of scope for discussion here.\r\n\r\n> Subsequently the service was gated behind the NetPermissionFlags::Mempool flag, meaning that the original BIP identitifcation method is no longer sufficient to determine that a node will offer this service to you (the node operator must whitelist or otherwise elevate your net permissions before they will respond to it). Therefore I think that it is safe to remove without any change in protocol version.\r\n\r\nIt could still be helpful in testing. Since we have lot of inconsistencies in mempool policies recently for political reasons, I think we should keep this P2P message available at least for testing if `NetPermissionFlags::Mempool` flag cannot be removed.",

If the receiving node is offline, you can copy the mempool dat (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25018#issuecomment-1112505941), but I guess that replaces the mempool, instead of only appending transactions.

      "body" : "Thanks for the comments all. I am currently editing a ML post to get feedback from a wider audience too, as sensibly suggested.\r\n\r\nReplies to some comments below:\r\n\r\n> It could still be helpful in testing. Since we have lot of inconsistencies in mempool policies recently for political reasons, I think we should keep this P2P message available at least for testing if NetPermissionFlags::Mempool flag cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nAFAIK even for use in \"testing\" this would require custom code or a patched node (to send and handle the messages) as Bitcoin Core cannot send them. Even if we did remove this message anyone wanting the same functionality for testing could either again run a custom-patched node and/or change their test code to dump the entire mempool from the host node using `savemempool` and then parse/feed transactions to the client node.\r\n\r\n> I'd be curious to know how people feel about a \"mempool-sync\" functionality -- let's say we came up with a way to use Erlay's set reconciliation (or some other method, like weak blocks) to try to sync the top of node mempools from time to time. Is there a reason that would be a bad idea (assuming we can prevent DoS)? And if not, would that imply that the mempool command (for whitelisted peers, to avoid DoS or privacy attacks) isn't so bad to have either?\r\n\r\nThis is a very nice thought experiment which I would like to think about more, thanks. My gut tells me that querying arbitrary mempools via P2P is likely to damage tx origin privacy if not very carfeully implemented, as nodes _may_ not end up with as much control over when they broadcast transactions -- something we currently rely on for network privacy.\r\n\r\n> Not knowing whether it's used seems a bad starting point? And it's only an extra boolean and 20 something lines of code, which doesn't seem like a big deal? I would have expected it to be kept around until BIP 37 (bloom filtering) support was dropped entirely, but don't really have a justification for that.\r\n\r\nTo be clear here, I know it's not used by Bitcoin Core, but the idea of this request for comments is to find out if it's used by any end-users/services which is something we can't find out any other way? Whilst I agree wrt BIP37, I think that would be more controversial as it likely still sees (ill-advised) use, but again, this is un-measured by myself and my long-running node has not had bloom filters enabled for some time.\r\n\r\n> I'd like to have a better way to sync mempools between my own nodes (eg, if my signet inquisition miner goes down and misses some transactions, they generally won't just reappear automatically). Dumping the entire mempool and then running sendrawtransaction a bunch of times is a bit annoying...\r\n\r\nHow do you do this currently? I agree that a mempool sync would be nice to have but I don't think P2P messages are the best way for it to work...\r\n\r\n> So I guess I'm -0.1 on this; but would be +0.5 on keeping it and adding a \"sendmempoolcmdtopeer\" rpc so that it can be used?|\r\n\r\nAgree that if people want this functionality that this UX would be better even than dumping and loading the mempool, even if slightly less efficient and incomplete (see next reply).\r\n\r\n> Maybe I am missing something, but I fail to see how the expiry time can be synced over p2p.

However, as you also mentioned, it is no longer widely used and has been closed behind the NetPermissionFlags::Mempool flag due to privacy concerns.\r\n\r\nBased on this, it seems reasonable to simplify the P2P code by removing this message, as long as this can be done without changing the protocol version. However, before doing so, it is important to ensure that there are no major use cases for this message that could be affected by its removal.\r\n\r\nYou suggested looking for feedback from Concept ACKs or anyone who is still actively using this message to find out more about your use cases. This is a good idea and can help ensure that removing the message doesn't negatively affect any major use cases. In addition, it can also be helpful to perform careful testing to ensure that removing the message does not cause unexpected problems or interruptions in the protocol's functioning.",
