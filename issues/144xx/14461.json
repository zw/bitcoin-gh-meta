The wallet shows my correct balances and all transactions but I'm not able to unlock it with my correct password when I try to send or receive bitcoins (I did secure it with my password). \r\n\r\nAt the beginning I thought the password/s I was using aren't correct, but then I made an observation, that only when I type in only one specific password then I receive this message in popup:\r\n>>>assertion failed<<<\r\n>>>program: C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe<<<\r\n>>>File: wallet/crypter.cpp, line 205<<<\r\n>>>expression false<<<\r\n\r\n>>>Runtime Error<<<\r\n>>>program: C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe<<<\r\n\r\nWhen I enter any other passwords only message I get your password is incorrect and never receive the message in popup described above. I can use incorrect passwords all day and that message doesn't appear at all, but as soon as I enter correct password the message is on.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\nafter I enter my password I expected to unlock my wallet, but that isn't a case and instead I get an error and I'm not able to send or receive bitcoins\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\nThis error message appears only when I type in my correct password. If I type in any other password this message doesn't appear, but instead it tells me the provided password is incorrect. Message in a popup when a correct password is being used:\r\n>>>assertion failed<<<\r\n>>>program: C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe<<<\r\n>>>File: wallet/crypter.cpp, line 205<<<\r\n>>>expression false<<<\r\n\r\n>>>Runtime Error<<<\r\n>>>program: C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe<<<\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\neach time I enter the correct password the window with the message with an error message appears. If I type in any other (not correct) password this doesn't happen at all. I can type 20 incorrect passwords and the error message above doesn't popup.\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nv0.17.0\r\nHave downloaded it from bitcoin.org website\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nwindows 8.1\r\n64 bit operating system\r\n500GB SSD hard disk\r\nintel celeron cpu N2840 2.16 GHz\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\nI have reinstalled the wallet, deleted all files under /roaming folder (approx. 145GB), so totally clean \r\ninstallation. Only old file is my wallet.dat file.\r\n\r\n![btc error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44040275/46770496-f38aa580-ccef-11e8-88c2-0d9defc4efdd.png)\r\n\r\n[log file.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/2466745/log.file.txt)\r\n",
