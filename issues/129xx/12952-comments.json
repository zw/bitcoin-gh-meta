If an empty string \\\"\\\" is passed in, only unlabeled addresses are selected. I do not see a clear reason to not allow \\\"\\*\\\" as a wildcard argument, to select from all addresses - labeled and unlabeled. Is there a good reason to keep this legacy restriction?",

I guess we will just have to exclude BTC from our platform as waiting for lengthy times (some times hours) will not work when using the sendtoaddress plus the high fees for every transaction.

What used to be called an account is now just called a label, and you can still apply labels to addresses.\r\n\r\nWhat was removed was runtime code for \"sending from\" labels, and code for filtering balances with labels, because it's error prone to refer to transaction outputs (coins) in the wallet by address or label. Addresses don't uniquely identify outputs, and not all outputs have addresses, so accounting based on addresses can't really be sound and is likely to lead to mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut since the wallet is storing exactly the same information as before, it's still possible for software using the wallet API to use indirectly use labels ~for coin selection when creating transactions or~ computing balances. Instead of referring to transaction outputs indirectly by label it will have to look them up with an api like `listtransactions` and refer to them precisely.\r\n\r\nEDIT (correction above): accounts/labels were never actually used for coin selection when creating transactions. Accounts were just passively stored as part of address and transaction metadata and only used for computing balances.",

      "body" : "Small correction above: I misremembered what sending from an account with `sendfrom` or `sendmany` actually did before \"send from\" functionality was removed in #14023 / [0.17.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.0.md#label-and-account-apis-for-wallet). It actually did not affect coin selection at all, but just added a [`mapValue[\"fromaccount\"]`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/794e55be104ccbfbf92569fa7572d2d4b0b4ad7c/src/wallet/wallet.h#L317) string field to outgoing transaction metadata stored in the wallet. Then it would treat transactions with this field as debits when computing account balances.\r\n\r\nThis means that replicating previous account functionality by just calling different RPC now should actually be simpler than what I suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12952#issuecomment-552523337, because it wouldn't require doing any coin selection when spending, or having to determine whether specific outputs had been spent while computing balances. It would just require associating label names with outgoing transactions, which could be done for example by putting label names in one of the transaction [comment fields](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/794e55be104ccbfbf92569fa7572d2d4b0b4ad7c/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L522-L526).\r\n",
