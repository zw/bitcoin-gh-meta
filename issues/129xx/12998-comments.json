Re-implementing just enough of Bitcoin Core's configure to define the appropriate symbols seems like the wrong way to go (and would be entirely unmaintainable), actually running autogen/configure would also be a pain as we'd have to figure out what environment we're targeting and appropriately convert gcc flags to configure flags (as well as probably reimplement parts of the \"compile a C dependency\" rust module that is well-maintained by others). Not sure of another easy solution aside from this, but if we don't take it we should almost certainly add a #ifndef HAVE_CONFIG_H #error \"You need to run configure first\" in a bunch of places.",

For example, I believe that these aren't present on macOS. And I don't think we can assume that they're always defines when they do exist.\r\n\r\nImo what makes the most sense is (using htobe16 as an example):\r\n- rename all external calls to htobe16_int. I don't think there should be (m)any of these outside of crypto/.\r\n- If HAVE_CONFIG_H, htobe16_int is defined as htobe16, essentially as it's done now\r\n- If no HAVE_CONFIG_H and HAVE_DECL_HTOBE16, same as above, so that it can be overridden by other projects that know about their environment\r\n- If no HAVE_CONFIG_H and no HAVE_DECL_HTOBE16, htobe16_int is an explicit manual conversion function",
