The reindex itself does seem to be progressing as the 'last block time' text is progressing at a decent speed and sequentially by date and time. See behaviour here: http://imgur.com/kelVOnT\r\n\r\nNot sure but I think I remember the progress bar moved sequentially forward in time only the last time I reindexed (also with 0.14.1).\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\nIt's still re-indexing and will take a while so is not easy to reproduce without taking my node off line.\r\n\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nProgress reported normally\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nJumps back and forth by a few years\r\n\r\n### Screenshots.\r\nVideo - http://imgur.com/kelVOnT\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nBinary on Windows 64 bit - 0.14.1\r\nFrom: https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.14.1/bitcoin-0.14.1-win64-setup.exe\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Windows 10 Pro\r\n- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\n- RAM: 4GB\r\n- Disk size: Client runs on 256GB SSD, datadir points to a 1TB internal HDD\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD):  Client runs on 256GB SSD, datadir points to a 1TB internal HDD\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\n",
