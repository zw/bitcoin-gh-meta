The\nthread Suhas liked to, explains why wildcards could be useful to write\ntests more productively and with less hassle.\n\nPlease note that we don't have a general coding guide for python code at\nthis point and refactoring for the sake of pep8 without previous discussion\nmight cause more hassle than it is worth.\n\nSo Concept NACK on this pull for now, as it would conflict with the ongoing\ntest_framework refactoring.
