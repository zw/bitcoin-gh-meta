   "body" : "This first commit delays requesting blocks from peers unless their tip has more than `nMinimumChainWork` (our anti-DoS threshold).  This speeds up initial headers sync by delaying block downloads from starting until we're closer to being caught up.\r\n\r\nThe second commit implements a timeout on the initial headers sync: when we send the initial getheaders to a peer, estimate the number of headers we expect to receive, and set a timeout (15 minutes + 1 ms / header).\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty naive algorithm, but I think the worst case behavior (eg if we're bottlenecked by our own bandwidth) is that we cycle through peers while downloading headers, at most every 15 minutes -- which I think isn't too awful, since those 15 minute windows should be making progress at least, and this bounds the time a bad peer can interfere with headers sync. \r\n\r\nFYI I kicked off a fresh node with this patch, and it took me about 1 minute to have the whole headers chain.\r\n\r\nImplements #9068, though this isn't the exact approach @sipa suggested in that issue.",
