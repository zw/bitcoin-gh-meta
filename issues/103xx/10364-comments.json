It seems quite odd to me to have a *single* fuzzing binary and input corpus.\r\n\r\nAny modern fuzzer (at least libfuzzer) is taking code coverage into account when generating new input. By joining all APIs to be fuzzed into a single call, and use the first 32 bit to switch between them, I'm sure we make genetic algorithm looking for inputs less efficient.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, it would be a lot more efficient to use *separate* binaries for each API to be fuzzed, *and* to use a separate corpus for each of them. It doesn't make much sense to test all inputs against all APIs.",
