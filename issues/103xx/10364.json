   "body" : "Making Bitcoin ready for inclusion into the `OSS-Fuzz` project should be fairly straightforward:\r\n* Have a look at [test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp) and read the [Bitcoin fuzzing documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md).\r\n* Make `test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp` `libFuzzer`-friendly by implementing `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`. See the [`libFuzzer` documentation for details](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).\r\n* Create the three configuration files `project.yaml`, `Dockerfile` and `build.sh` as described in the [`OSS-Fuzz` new project guide](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/docs/new_project_guide.md) and submit an `OSS-Fuzz` pull request.\r\n\r\nToday [Google announced that they offer $1k to $20k in rewards for properly integrated project](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html).\r\n\r\nHave a nice vacation and enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling of having helped secure the Bitcoin network! :-)",
