For instance, a low fee tx is very easy to double-spend, and we'll happily produce them. Similarly we'll happily spend unconfirmed change in many circumstances, which again causes txs to get rejected by zeroconf risk analysis's. Not a particularly predictable UX, so i'm not worried about a default to opt-in, which does have benefits. (also the benefit of ensuring opt-in txs are accepted properly by other wallets!)",
