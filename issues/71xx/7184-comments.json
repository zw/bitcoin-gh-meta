Err, I mean, Tested ACK :) \r\n\r\nTesting methodology: \r\n  * Pulled down @btcdrak's combined  BIP68+OP_CSV branch: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...btcdrak:sequenceandcsv. \r\n  * Started a local Bitcoin Core node with the `-regtest` flag activated. \r\n  * I then created an [integration test](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd/commit/05f4d1fa9721f7e8c44844b719294a5f06cc21a9) in a [new branch](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd/tree/csv-test) within [lnd](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd) created specifically to test the combined BIP 68+112 branch. This particular test case directly exercises a possible scenario within LN, wherein one of the sides immediately broadcasts the current (and only) commitment transaction. As a result of this uncooperative closure, the party that broadcasted the transaction must wait a CSV delay before they can re-claim their funds.\r\n  * The test case exercises the following negative paths when verifying a transaction attempting to spend a CSV output, additionally ensuring the txn spending the CSV output is mature enough: \r\n     * invalid tx version\r\n     * mismatched sequence numbers\r\n     * sequence disable flag set\r\n     * CSV delay pre-mature \r\n\r\nThe test case detailed above can be found [here](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd/blob/csv-test/lnwallet/script_utils_test.go). \r\n\r\nA major thanks to all those involved from BIP drafting, to BIP review, to coding the reference implementation, to code review, and finally, testing. As Joseph said above, relative time-locks are _extremely_ useful within the Lightning Network Ã°ÂÂÂ.",

So multiple commits that implement separate parts of a feature, make sense on their own, and result in a working codebase on their own are certainly welcome, but I don't think we should aim for having the exact history of a pull request, and certainly not when some commits are broken and need follow-up commits for fixing.",

One should try to order commits so that it does not break atomicity, or create intermediate pulls that fail buld/test, as that messes with `git bisect`.\r\nAlso @sipa makes a good point that commit history should be optimized for reviewing, not what happened to be the chronological order of changes at the time. This may involve multiple commits if that makes reviewing easier (due to separate concerns, for example, or moves+changes).\r\n\r\nPutting the commit hash in comments is a help to compare the version that was reviewed to the version that was merged - it is not meant to reduce flexibility of the developer with regard to ordering commits.\r\n\r\nProcess discussion is completely off-topic here though, so let's leave it at that.",
