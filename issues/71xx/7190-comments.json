Then a reorg happens that replace BlockA with BlockB then tx1 will have, as expected, locktime invalidated.\r\nThis must be done, and can't be optimized, because the blockTime in LockTime(), MTP or not, will have changed.\r\n\r\nIf I understand your point : yes, during a reorg, all transaction which came since the last block will be invalidated, and they should be.",

I'm just saying you don't have to recalculate the time/height at which the sequence locks are valid which is the expensive part.\r\nWith your solution I think you will still be recalculating sequence locks for a significant fraction of the mempool on a reorg which is slow and destroys your utxo cache.\r\n",
