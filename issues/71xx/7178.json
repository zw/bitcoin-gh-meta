   "body" : "I haven't been following too closely the developments around coin age priority, but my understanding is that it is being phased out (hence `DEFAULT_BLOCK_PRIORITY_SIZE` being set to 0).\n\nShouldn't `DEFAULT_LIMITFREERELAY` be set to zero as well, then?  If priority block space is being phased out, then free transactions are going to have a much harder time getting into blocks (according to what I'm observing as well), so to prevent a bunch of un-mineable txs from piling up we should discourage limitfreerelay.\n\nAlso, it makes it easier for people to double-spend their zero-fee transactions, if those transactions weren't hanging around in a bunch of mempools because of high priority, yet not being able to be confirmed.\n",
