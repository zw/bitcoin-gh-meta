And use `free` in `~MemoryResource`.\r\nI also changed the default allocation size `m_block_size_bytes` from 262144 to `sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)`. \r\n\r\nSo for node size of 104 bytes and page size 4096, this should allocate a page-alligned block with 39*104=4056 bytes.",

I think the only reason the memory is lower is because the `memusage::DynamicUsage` now overestimates the memory requirements of the `std::unordered_map` that uses the node_allocator.

I think I understand the code a bit better now so it makes sense that most of you allocations are already aligned. One thing that strikes me is that it seems that you have these 104 byte chunks (13 uint64_t s). You might get better properties if you pad them out to the nearest 32/64/128 bytes (memory overhead 24 bytes :( ), because then you'll never have nodes across cache lines. Memory usage is a bit worse though, but cache perfomance may be better this way? https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/als00/2000papers/papers/full_papers/sears/sears_html/index.html for reference.\r\n\r\n",

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a freelist for further use.This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no control structure is required for each node memory, the freelist is stored inplace. This typically safes\n+ *   about 8 bytes per node.\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a freelist and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The freelist is a simple first-in-last-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements. So freeing and malloc'ing again\n+ *   can have an advantageous access pattern which leads to less cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator` compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Since there is\n+ * unfortunately no way to determine the size of nodes that we want to optimize for in advance, MemoryResource uses\n+ * a simple heuristic: We assume the first call to Allocate with 1 element is for the node, and upon that first call the\n+ * MemoryResource is configured to use that as it's chunk size. Note that due to this heuristic we cannot implement an\n+ * `std::pmr::memory_resource` because it does not gie the information about the number of elements.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *     https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

These blocks are kept around until the memory resource is destroyed.\n+ *\n+ * - Chunks: Node-based containers allocate one node at a time. Whenever that happens, the MemoryResource's Allocate() gives out\n+ *   one chunk of memory. These chunks are carved out from a previously allocated memory block.

The tracepoint reports the time it took to connect each block. This means my results don't include the time it took to download and, AFAIK, not the time it took to persist the block to disk. I didn't look at memory usage. \r\n\r\nI've oriented myself on @jamesob's parameters and synced the blocks 500.000 to 540.000 from a localhost peer three times for the PR and the MB. I used the default dbcache (shouldn't matter for my measurements as cache flushes don't happen while inside `CChainState::ConnectBlock`). I've used an idle workstation with an i5 6500 and an NVME drive. Room and hardware temperature between runs changed which could have impacted performance. A `bpftrace` script to hook into the tracepoint can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/0xB10C/7f9010d44f1d97fbf1c83ec7f98155fd).\r\n\r\nTotal time spent in  `CChainState::ConnectBlock` per run for PR and MB: \r\n| run | 1         | 2     | 3     | \r\n|-----|-----------|-------|-------|\r\n| PR  | **1427s** | 1487s | 1486s | \r\n| MB  | **1577s** | 1670s | 1661s |\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/129805353-5b48c0c1-1184-49c2-800c-196f1eed89c8.png)\r\n(PR run 2 and run 3 are overlapping quite a bit and indistinguishably here)\r\n\r\nMy results confirm that less time is spent in `CChainState::ConnectBlock` with PR compared to MB.

The benchmark got maybe 1% slower, but maybe the benchmark is also not very realistic. I also tried to reduce the size by 8 byte (which can be done by making use of the `Coin`'s padding in `CCoinsCacheEntry`, I might open anothe PR for that), and it got about ~1% faster. I think though that even with no performance benefit the node_allocator is worthwhile because it has lower memory overhead, so we can cache more entries with the same `-dbcache` setting.\r\n\r\n@jonatack Thanks for the review!

You might get a bit more stable result with [pyperf](https://pyperf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): I always use `sudo pyperf system tune` before I run a benchmark which does a few things to make benchmarks much more stable (e.g. locks the CPU to a fixed frequency, disables turbo boost)",

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically saves\n+ *   about 8 bytes per node.\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements. So freeing and malloc'ing again\n+ *   can have an advantageous access pattern which leads to less cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator` compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Since there is\n+ * unfortunately no way to determine the size of nodes that we want to optimize for in advance, MemoryResource uses\n+ * a simple heuristic: We assume the first call to Allocate with 1 element is for the node, and upon that first call the\n+ * MemoryResource is configured to use that as its chunk size.

Since there is\n+ * unfortunately no way to determine the size of nodes that we want to optimize for in advance, MemoryResource uses\n+ * a simple heuristic: We assume the first call to Allocate with 1 element is for the node, and upon that first call the\n+ * MemoryResource is configured to use that as its chunk size. Note that due to this heuristic we cannot implement a\n+ * `std::pmr::memory_resource` because it does not give the information about the number of elements.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *     https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically saves\n+ *   about 8 bytes per node.\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements. So freeing and malloc'ing again\n+ *   can have an advantageous access pattern which leads to less cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator` compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Since there is\n+ * unfortunately no way to determine the size of nodes that we want to optimize for in advance, MemoryResource uses\n+ * a simple heuristic: We assume the first call to Allocate with 1 element is for the node, and upon that first call the\n+ * MemoryResource is configured to use that as its chunk size. Note that due to this heuristic we cannot implement a\n+ * `std::pmr::memory_resource` because it does not give the information about the number of elements.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *     https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator. MemoryResource is an immobile object. It stores a number of memory blocks\n+ * (the pool) which are used to quickly give out memory of a fixed chunk size. The class is purposely kept very simple. It only\n+ * knows about \"Chunks\" and \"Blocks\".\n+ *\n+ * - Block: MemoryResource allocates one memory block at a time.

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically saves\n+ *   about 8 bytes per node.\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements. So freeing and malloc'ing again\n+ *   can have an advantageous access pattern which leads to less cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator` compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Since there is\n+ * unfortunately no way to determine the size of nodes that we want to optimize for in advance, MemoryResource uses\n+ * a simple heuristic: We assume the first call to Allocate with 1 element is for the node, and upon that first call the\n+ * MemoryResource is configured to use that as its chunk size. Note that due to this heuristic we cannot implement a\n+ * `std::pmr::memory_resource` because it does not give the information about the number of elements.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *     https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

The results are very similar as before, just both runs are relatively faster. Interestingly, with such a large dbsize the branch never needs to flush the cache, only when finished, while master has to flush once because it got full around the 190 minute mark. That's also why memory usage of the branch is a bit lower here.\r\n\r\n| what | mergebase | #22702 | Change \r\n---|---:|---:|---:\r\nElapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss) | 3:29:56 | 2:43:43 | 22.0% faster\r\nMaximum resident set size (kbytes) | 10303716 | 9637256 | 6.4% lower\r\nMinor (reclaiming a frame) page faults | 24088467 | 3836829 | 84% fewer\r\nFile system inputs | 693485000 | 696413568 | 0.4% more\r\nFile system outputs | 109392776 | 81335536 | 25.6% fewer\r\n\r\nAgain, graphs are generated from parsing the `debug.log` files, on an Intel i7 8700 locked to 3.2 GHz:\r\n![Progress in Million Transactions over Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/131080470-18a5a79a-0849-4897-8dee-5eec709d6ab4.png)\r\n![Size of Cache in MiB over Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/131080505-23278cc5-8977-4a73-beec-4f2ece769fae.png)\r\n![Size of Cache in Million tx over Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/131080519-b01abbdb-1300-4acb-aa82-17d83278fdc1.png)\r\n",

Such an allocator is specifically useful for standard library collection types which involve a separately-allocated object (which I guess are called nodes?) for each item (this would apply to things like `std::{,forward_}list`, `std::{,unordered_}{,multi}{set,map}`; I'm unsure about `std::deque`).",

      "body" : "@jamesob concerning limitations, I can't really think of much... I think the biggest change is that the `MemoryResource` doesn't free memory any more. So once the map reaches a size, memory usage won't decrease even when the map gets smaller. You can see that nicely in this graph: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/131080505-23278cc5-8977-4a73-beec-4f2ece769fae.png The blue line is mergebase and when map size decreases memory goes down. For this PR the memory stays constant (at a lower level because it needs less memory).\r\n\r\nAnother concern is that on some systems malloc could be exceptionally fast, or implemented differently, so that this `node_allocator` is not actually a performance / memory benefit. \r\n\r\n@sipa concerning incorrectly calculating object sizes, I think this can be covered in unit tests. In the new test `test_chunks_are_used` I'm trying to create `std::unordered_map` with all kind of alignments with and without a `noexcept` hash, and assert if the MemoryResource is actually used. I could also add another test that actually uses `CCoinsMap` to see if the allocator is used.\r\n\r\nAbout having a list of memory blobs per allocation size: I've thought about that, but I've tried to keep the allocator as simple as possible and didn't want to make it more complex. By the way the logic is quite a bit similar to python's pymalloc (which I've discovered after I wrote most of it...): https://www.evanjones.ca/memoryallocator/ Newer versions have multiple pools of different byte sizes, and also the ability to actually free chunks. Of course then the allocator would become much more complex.\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky Node based containers are all containers where for each element they need to allocate data (the actual content + some control structure). For `std::unordered_map` that node usually consists of key+value pair and a pointer. Sometimes hash value is also stored in the node. Only `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::array` are not node based. The nodes are a big performance issue because it's always a layer of indirection and requires allocation, but it is necessary so pointers/references to data stays valid even when the container is modified.",

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place.

Not being able to easily compute size of the block (it requires runtime multiplication and division) I think indirectly led to `m_untouched_memory_end` being added unnecessarily. Not having a compile-time block size also appears to be a reason `m_allocated_blocks` is using `void*` and raw new/deletes instead of safer types like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::array`\r\n\r\nMaking this const would also have more minor benefit of improving clarity by being able to declare useful constants up front and not have things like  `/ m_chunk_size_bytes * m_chunk_size_bytes` various places in the code.",

Maybe do `friend class MemoryResourceTester;` instead and move it to test code. My concerns here are verbosity of this header, and temptation for someone to call this inappropriately in some performance counter or log statement. If this should be exposed publicly, maybe it should have a name like `CountFreeChunks` so it doesn't look like an innocuous accessor method.",

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

It only\n+ * knows about \"Chunks\" and \"Blocks\".\n+ *\n+ * - Block: MemoryResource allocates one memory block at a time. These blocks are kept around until the memory resource is destroyed.\n+ *\n+ * - Chunks: Node-based containers allocate one node at a time. Whenever that happens, the MemoryResource's Allocate() gives out\n+ *   one chunk of memory. These chunks are carved out from a previously allocated memory block, or from a free list if it contains entries.\n+ *   Whenever a node is given back with Deallocate(), it is put into that free list.\n+ */\n+class MemoryResource\n+{\n+    //!

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

It only\n+ * knows about \"Chunks\" and \"Blocks\".\n+ *\n+ * - Block: MemoryResource allocates one memory block at a time. These blocks are kept around until the memory resource is destroyed.\n+ *\n+ * - Chunks: Node-based containers allocate one node at a time. Whenever that happens, the MemoryResource's Allocate() gives out\n+ *   one chunk of memory. These chunks are carved out from a previously allocated memory block, or from a free list if it contains entries.\n+ *   Whenever a node is given back with Deallocate(), it is put into that free list.\n+ */\n+class MemoryResource\n+{\n+    //!

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

It only\n+ * knows about \"Chunks\" and \"Blocks\".\n+ *\n+ * - Block: MemoryResource allocates one memory block at a time. These blocks are kept around until the memory resource is destroyed.\n+ *\n+ * - Chunks: Node-based containers allocate one node at a time. Whenever that happens, the MemoryResource's Allocate() gives out\n+ *   one chunk of memory. These chunks are carved out from a previously allocated memory block, or from a free list if it contains entries.\n+ *   Whenever a node is given back with Deallocate(), it is put into that free list.\n+ */\n+class MemoryResource\n+{\n+    //!

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator. MemoryResource is an immobile object. It stores a number of memory blocks\n+ * (the pool) which are used to quickly give out memory of a fixed chunk size. The class is purposely kept very simple. It only\n+ * knows about \"Chunks\" and \"Blocks\".\n+ *\n+ * - Block: MemoryResource allocates one memory block at a time. These blocks are kept around until the memory resource is destroyed.\n+ *\n+ * - Chunks: Node-based containers allocate one node at a time. Whenever that happens, the MemoryResource's Allocate() gives out\n+ *   one chunk of memory. These chunks are carved out from a previously allocated memory block, or from a free list if it contains entries.\n+ *   Whenever a node is given back with Deallocate(), it is put into that free list.\n+ */\n+class MemoryResource\n+{\n+    //!

MemoryResource is an immobile object. It\n+ * stores a number of memory pools which are used to quickly give out memory of a fixed allocation\n+ * size. The class is purposely kept very simple. It only knows about \"Allocations\" and \"Pools\".\n+ *\n+ * - Pool: MemoryResource allocates one memory pool at a time. These pools are kept around until the\n+ * memory resource is destroyed.\n+ *\n+ * - Allocations: Node-based containers allocate one node at a time.

Nodes that are\n+ * destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored in-place. This typically\n+ *   saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but there is no\n+ *   standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to the system. Memory\n+ *   is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on proximity. So freeing\n+ *   and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers. Similar to\n+ * `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages chunks of memory. Currently it is only\n+ * able provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed node size which is given in the constructor. Only allocations that match this\n+ * size will be provided from the preallocated blocks of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new().\n+ * To get the correct node size in all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios in\n+ * `node_allocator_tests/test_chunks_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *      https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator. MemoryResource is an immobile object. It stores a number of memory blocks\n+ * (the pool) which are used to quickly give out memory of a fixed chunk size. The class is purposely kept very simple. It only\n+ * knows about \"Chunks\" and \"Blocks\".\n+ *\n+ * - Block: MemoryResource allocates one memory block at a time. These blocks are kept around until the memory resource is destroyed.\n+ *\n+ * - Chunks: Node-based containers allocate one node at a time. Whenever that happens, the MemoryResource's Allocate() gives out\n+ *   one chunk of memory. These chunks are carved out from a previously allocated memory block, or from a free list if it contains entries.\n+ *   Whenever a node is given back with Deallocate(), it is put into that free list.\n+ */\n+class MemoryResource\n+{\n+    //!

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

It seems to suggest about the [concern](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22702#issuecomment-941067769) that if \"the object size gets computed incorrectly by a future libstdc++ change... we'll silently fall back to old performance\" that in theory we could detect at compile time, not runtime, whether a container implementation was calling `Allocator::allocate` with an unexpected `T` size for that implementation.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't seem worth implementing this if it requires lots of template trickery or tracking down compile errors on different platforms, especially if NodeSize unit test coverage works OK practically.\r\n\r\n(Version: a91b6032f037ab1a26ac4baa761e809fbfeb1bdd)",

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map.

It can't be smaller, because sizeof(char) is always 1, but if they are the same size, then the test isn't really meaningful. I guess my suggestion would be to replace `void*` with a type guaranteed to be bigger like `std::pair<char, char>`.\r\n\r\n(Version: a91b6032f037ab1a26ac4baa761e809fbfeb1bdd)",

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Nodes\n+ * that are destroyed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated\n+ * pools of memory; all other requests simply use ::operator new(). To get the correct node size in\n+ * all cases it is unfortunately necessary to have a look at the various implementations of\n+ * std::unordered_map. There is currently no standard way of getting the node size programmatically.\n+ *\n+ * Node size is determined by memusage::NodeSize and verified to work in various alignment scenarios\n+ * in `node_allocator_tests/test_allocations_are_used`.\n+ *\n+ * ## Further Links\n+ *\n+ * @see CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall âHow to Write a Custom Allocatorâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWfushlvB8\n+ * @see C++Now 2018: Arthur O'Dwyer âAn Allocator is a Handle to a Heapâ\n+ *   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MdSJsCTRkY\n+ * @see AllocatorAwareContainer: Introduction and pitfalls of propagate_on_container_XXX defaults\n+ *   https://www.foonathan.net/2015/10/allocatorawarecontainer-propagation-pitfalls/\n+ */\n+namespace node_allocator {\n+\n+namespace detail {\n+\n+/**\n+ * In-place linked list of the allocations, used for the free list.\n+ */\n+struct FreeList {\n+    void* next;\n+};\n+\n+/**\n+ * Calculates the required allocation size for the given type.\n+ * The memory needs to be correctly aligned and large enough for both both T and FreeList.\n+ */\n+template <typename T>\n+[[nodiscard]] constexpr size_t RequiredAllocationSizeBytes() noexcept\n+{\n+    const auto alignment_max = std::max(std::alignment_of_v<T>, std::alignment_of_v<FreeList>);\n+    const auto size_max = std::max(sizeof(T), sizeof(FreeList));\n+\n+    // find closest multiple of alignment_max that holds size_max\n+    return ((size_max + alignment_max - 1U) / alignment_max) * alignment_max;\n+}\n+\n+} // namespace detail\n+\n+/**\n+ * Actually holds and provides memory to an allocator.

Instead of not including the size of allocated nodes in the container size when an allocator is used, the container can report its size the same way whether or not an allocator is used, and the allocator can only report the size of unallocated space instead of the total allocated + unallocated space. I think this would make the accounting more intuitive, in addition to making the container size calculation independent of the allocator size calculation.",

So I need at least a forward declaration of `node_allocator::Allocator`. But that is fine I guess, I'll create a forward declaration then there's no circular dependency any more.\r\n\r\nAlso I'll split up `NodeSize` calculation into a separate independent file that both `memusage` and the allocator can use, so there are no circular dependency for that too.",

Nodes\n+ * that are freed by the Allocator are actually put back into a free list for further use. This\n+ * behavior has two main advantages:\n+ *\n+ * - Memory: no malloc control structure is required for each node memory; the free list is stored\n+ * in-place. This typically saves about 16 bytes per node.\n+ *\n+ * - Performance: much fewer calls to malloc/free. Accessing / putting back entries are O(1) with\n+ * low constant overhead.\n+ *\n+ * There's no free lunch, so there are also disadvantages:\n+ *\n+ * - It is necessary to know the exact size of the container internally used nodes beforehand, but\n+ * there is no standard way to get this.\n+ *\n+ * - Memory that's been used for nodes is always put back into a free list and never given back to\n+ * the system. Memory is only freed when the MemoryResource is destructed.\n+ *\n+ * - The free list is a simple last-in-first-out linked list, it doesn't reorder elements based on\n+ * proximity. So freeing and malloc'ing again can become a random access pattern which can lead to\n+ * more cache misses.\n+ *\n+ * ## Design & Implementation\n+ *\n+ * Allocator is a cheaply copyable, `std::allocator`-compatible type used for the containers.\n+ * Similar to `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, it holds a pointer to a memory resource.\n+ *\n+ * MemoryResource is an immobile object that actually allocates, holds and manages memory. Currently\n+ * it is only able to provide optimized alloc/free for a single fixed allocation size which is given\n+ * in the constructor. Only allocations that match this size will be provided from the preallocated",

This is a helper class for figuring out memory usage of a standard container, so functionally it is more related to memusage than node_allocator. Memusage needs this to function, while node_allocator::Allocator and node_allocator::MemoryResource are both usable without it. Also, In the future, we may also want to experiment with writing new allocators, and it would be nice if they could reuse this `NodeSize` class without having to reinvent it or depend on `node_allocator` themselves. Also, combined with other suggestions, moving this class out of node_allocator would allow us to break the node_allocator <-> memusage cyclic dependency and have node_allocator just depend on memusage in one direction.\r\n\r\n(Moving this class out of node_allocator could also let you split off the first two commits of this PR into their own PR so this PR could be smaller, even though I do think this PR is small enough and wouldn't see a need for that.)",

I don't like how it:\r\n\r\n- Makes memusage.h depend node_allocator, when the job of memusage is just to tell us about memory usage of standard types, and it shouldn't need to be referencing a particular specialized allocator.\r\n- Redefines the concept of memory usage for this one unordered_map+node_allocator container to not consider memory allocated by the container to be \"used\" by the container, even though the container allocated that memory, and is still responsible for deallocating (if not freeing) it.\r\n- Will require new specializations of map+node_allocator or list+node_allocator to be added here if node_allocator is used with other map or list containers in the future.\r\n\r\nI think code can be simpler, definition of \"usage\" can be more consistent, and cyclic dependencies and special cases can be removed using earlier suggestions from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22702#discussion_r737676396, and only downside would be adding a counter variable.

That should be correct in most cases, but it might not be when `RequiredAllocationSizeBytes<typename NodeSize...>` (in `factory.h`) gives a different result than the NodeSize. The only way to do this correctly is to also pass the result of `NodeSize` to the `MemoryResource`, but this complicates things.\r\n\r\nI also don't like that in most cases `memoryresource.DynamicMemoryUsage()` will return a negative number (causing `size_t` underflow) to correct for the overestimation in memusage.

      "body" : " Here is a concrete example that I just tried with `CCoinsMap`. I created a CCoinsMap and added 100k entries. `memusage::DynamicUsage` calculates this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nreturn MallocUsage(node_size) * m.size() + MallocUsage(sizeof(void*) * m.bucket_count());\r\n// return MallocUsage(104) * 100000 + MallocUsage(8 * 172933)  \r\n// return 128 * 100000 + 1383488\r\n// return 14183488\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `DynamicUsage` estimates 13.5MB memory usage. This is too much, because `node_allocator` doesn't have the overhead of malloc. `MallocUsage` uses 128 bytes per node, but when `node_allocator` the bytes per node are actually just 104. So when calculating `MemoryResource::DynamicMemoryUsage` we'd have to subtract the `128*100000` and not `104*100000` to get the correct memory usage:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nreturn memusage::MallocUsage(POOL_SIZE_BYTES) * m_allocated_pools.size() + memusage::DynamicUsage(m_allocated_pools) - ALLOCATION_SIZE_BYTES * m_allocations;\r\n// return MallocUsage(262080) * 40 + 528 - 104 * 100000 // <-- incorrect, has to be 128*100000\r\n// return 262096 * 40 + 528 - 128*100000 // correct, but no easy way to get the correct 128 bytes within MemoryResource\r\n// return -2315632\r\n```",

The reason is that it adds quite a lot of complexity, and depends on quite some C++ magic and cleverness (e.g. relying on `unordered_map` internals). C++ being not exactly a memory-safe language, this increases the risk of accidental foot-guns. I appreciate the work it's great to make things faster, and I really don't want to discourage it, but, especially as long as it's used for consensus code we do have to err on the side of safety and correctness.",

Is it that the node crashes or is it consensus problems (or both)?\r\n\r\nI think the major concern here could be summarized as \"we're worried about unknown unknowns.\" Swapping out an allocator (or as in the original case of #16718, the whole map implementation) entails displacing a lot of low-level C++ code that is widely deployed and tested by the standard library with code that we (or if not just us, a much smaller subset of the software world) maintain and test. \r\n\r\nIf anything goes wrong with the UTXO set, it's no news to everyone that it certainly spells big issues for bitcoin. While the performance gains here are very enticing, and indeed @luke-jr earlier made the interesting point that maybe moving this critical code into our domain of control (and out of the black box of std) may be preferable, since we would explicitly understand and maintain a very core dependency of the validation process, this \"mountain man\" approach obviously has an associated cost: maintaining such an important and sensitive piece of the system represents a liability that we would no longer shoulder alongside the wider C++ usage base. \r\n\r\nI originally proposed the hashmap implementation change that (I think?) inspired @martinus to undertake this work. I'm glad he has done this work, even if it remains experimental, because it's important for us to understand this design space better. But that said I can understand why @laanwj would express an abundance of caution about this kind of thing, and it resonates with me. Everyone here understands that a change like this should not be done lightly, but even given that, it's hard to know when we've \"tested enough\" to know that this will be safe for perpetuity. Unknown unknowns. \r\n\r\nAll that said, I'm far from the most qualified systems guy on this project, so it would be interesting to hear from others like @sipa @ryanofsky @theuni @TheBlueMatt. Maybe we can fuzz this to death on a bunch of different platforms and convince ourselves that it's as safe or safer than using std's allocator. Such a determination is out of my ability.",

If so, will the memory resource still be parametrized by the size of the pooled objects in it?\r\n\r\nThere will be just a memory resource, which will be passed to a `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator`. I have a prototype of the memory resource here: https://gist.github.com/martinus/0cee4dd177beda78bb1e2e3d128c2d70\r\nThat's basically all that is needed in <100 lines of code. This implements the abstract `std::pmr::memory_resource` interface which is much simpler than implementing a full allocator. Doesn't need any rebinding, type casting, reinterpret_cast.\r\n\r\nAlso, instead of having to correctly guess the pool's memory size I simply use a vector with multiple pools of different size. Most of them will stay empty, but that overhead is negligible. \r\n\r\nUsage is like so:\r\n```cpp\r\nusing CCoinsMap = std::pmr::unordered_map<COutPoint, CCoinsCacheEntry, SaltedOutpointHasher>;\r\nauto mr = NodePoolResource<256>(); // large enough to fit nodes size\r\nauto map = CCoinsMap{0, SaltedOutpointHasher{}, std::equal_to<COutPoint>{}, &mr};\r\n```\r\n",
