CreateNewBlock needs to lock against modifying or deleting transactions and against reorgs. It also needs to make sure it's working off of the same blockchain tip the entire time, so it needs to grab a pointer to the tip at the beginning. It also needs to grab a view of the mempool that will not change. It does not need to prevent new transactions from being added to the mempool or new blocks from being added to the blockchain.",

Nothing that getblocktemplate creates is consumed by anything else except for the RPC caller. Any data that getblocktemplate needs from the rest of the system can be copied or (e.g. for mempool) locked in a fine-grained manner.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is no need for submitblock to lock everything for the entire duration of its activities. It can change the order of operations to check the new block's validity, commit it to memory as an object (but not necessarily as part of the chain), and notify peers all before locking cs_main and executing UpdateTip. \r\n\r\n@gmaxwell, if verifying a block actually requires mutable access to the chain state in order to verify a block (which sounds surprising to me, but I'll admit that I haven't checked and you probably know better than me), it still could be implemented with a lock just around the TestBlockValidity() calls. With production code, a medium-small fraction of the total time is taken in TestBlockValidity(). With morcos's work, that fraction dominates, it's true. It's also likely that calling TestBlockValidity both before and after sending a template to a miner is redundant.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I agree that this issue is not something that should be addressed right now, given how much faster GBT will be soon. I'd call it more of a target of opportunity. When writing code in the future, I think we should make an effort to think about what we actually need to have locked, and only lock those things. You are welcome to ignore my opinion.\r\n",

The result is surprising, but less so when you realize that most blocks are \"fast\".   There are a great many users that accept transactions at 2-confirms (and even wallets that just display 'confirmed' with no count at all), wise or not. So I don't think it's correct to say that it only matters if it goes on for hours.  It's only the SPV nodes that need to be worried about in any case; full nodes will happily ignore the invalid blocks. :)\r\n\r\nYou should also consider more than the verification time; most mining stacks (including the hardware/firmware itself) often has fairly high latency (and/or takes a performance hit if your update their work frequently)-- usually I use a rule of thumb and figure any work you issue will be hashed on for at least 30 seconds. When I observe work issued by pools, the delay from the first pool to half the pools moving to a new block is about 10x what bitcoind verification time is (even before the speedups in 0.12). \r\n\r\nOne of the larger verification skipping miners responded that even with the losses, they believe it has been very profitable for them, and they would continue doing it.  \r\n\r\nBut in any case, even all that said I think it's largely orthogonal with the aggressive forwarding.  Any amount of block extension without verification invalidates the security assumption of SPV; but thats a fault of extending bad chains, not a fault of forwarding things eagerly at least so long as the eager forwarding is marked as such.\r\n",

Once we have the MASTER lock we take out the VAR lock, then decrement the counter and if it is zero, we clear the boolean \"notify\" then release the VAR lock.\r\n\r\nWhere's the CPU usage issue in that design?
