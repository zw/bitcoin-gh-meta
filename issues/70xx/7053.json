This PR\r\ncontains that commit plus a few small additions ready to squash or\r\nleave out.\r\n\r\nIt may be disruptive to things we would really like to see in 0.12\r\nbefore the testing window closes, but I can easily rebase this on\r\ndemand, even after all the desired changes are merged and right\r\nbefore forking 0.12 (and I believe it will remain pretty reviewable and\r\nlow risk). It is likely that after rebase, this becomes more incomplete than it currently is, but better is better.",
