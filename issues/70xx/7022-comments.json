Are you sure you're not talking about the\n`prioritizetransaction` RPC? That keeps working and will continue to do so,\nand allows manually bumping a transaction ahead of the queue for mining\npurposes.\n\nAll this change does is reduce the default size of the amount of block\nspace dedicated to transactions that get included based on\nbitcoindays-destroyed-per-byte (instead of fee per byte) to zero. If there\nare problems that can be solved by having such a space, you can always turn\nit back on by setting a non-zero size manually.\n\nSeveral people (myself included) would like the concept of sorting by\nbitcoindays-destroyed-per-byte go away entirely over time, however, and\nthis is a step in that direction.\n\n* Maintaining this \"priority area\" complicates the mining-, mempool-,\nwallet-, and fee-estimation code significantly.\n* It works in a very non-optimal way. With a priority space, you may well\nkick out high fee transactions in favor of 0-fee transactions that just\nspend slightly older outputs. If bitcoin-days-destroyed-per-byte is\nsomething we value, I think we should account for it by having a single\nsort order that combines both, rather than having a dedicated space inside\nblocks.\n* At 50 kB it is hardly a useful measure against spam attacks. If it is, it\nwould mean that 950 kB of data is hardly usable due to being filled with\nhigh-fee spam, and we get a 50 kB \"usable\" space in every block in which\nactual transactions can occur. The priority space can be set to be bigger\n(and still can be after this PR!), but at that point risks reducing fee\nincome significantly. That may not be a worry now at the current fee\nlevels, but it's not a solution we should encourage long term, as it is\nincompatible with Bitcoin's long term security (with fees paying for\nsecurity).\n* Bitcoindays-destroyed-per-byte sorting unnecessarily benefits people who\nhold large amounts of old BTC.\n",

Are you sure you're not talking about the\n`prioritizetransaction` RPC? That keeps working and will continue to do so,\nand allows manually bumping a transaction ahead of the queue for mining\npurposes.\n\nAll this change does is reduce the default size of the amount of block\nspace dedicated to transactions that get included based on\nbitcoindays-destroyed-per-byte (instead of fee per byte) to zero. If there\nare problems that can be solved by having such a space, you can always turn\nit back on by setting a non-zero size manually.\n\nSeveral people (myself included) would like the concept of sorting by\nbitcoindays-destroyed-per-byte go away entirely over time, however, and\nthis is a step in that direction.\n\n* Maintaining this \"priority area\" complicates the mining-, mempool-,\nwallet-, and fee-estimation code significantly.\n* It works in a very non-optimal way. With a priority space, you may well\nkick out high fee transactions in favor of 0-fee transactions that just\nspend slightly older outputs. If bitcoin-days-destroyed-per-byte is\nsomething we value, I think we should account for it by having a single\nsort order that combines both, rather than having a dedicated space inside\nblocks.\n* At 50 kB it is hardly a useful measure against spam attacks. If it is, it\nwould mean that 950 kB of data is hardly usable due to being filled with\nhigh-fee spam, and we get a 50 kB \"usable\" space in every block in which\nactual transactions can occur. The priority space can be set to be bigger\n(and still can be after this PR!), but at that point risks reducing fee\nincome significantly. That may not be a worry now at the current fee\nlevels, but it's not a solution we should encourage long term, as it is\nincompatible with Bitcoin's long term security (with fees paying for\nsecurity).\n* Bitcoindays-destroyed-per-byte sorting unnecessarily benefits people who\nhold large amounts of old BTC.\n\nÃÂ\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7022#issuecomment-164413092> .\n\n  \n\n\n",
