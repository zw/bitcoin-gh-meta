For example, I've been experimenting syncing to a 2.49 GB RAM disk to avoid the heavy disk I/O on a laptop, and when spot checking it, the free space may have gotten below 500MB once or twice, but that's only what I've happened to have seen.  I've got enough RAM to expand the RAM disk a bit more, but I have no idea what would be sufficient.",

When pruning is enabled that also guarantees that \"block storage and undo files\" won't exceed the set threshold. What is left is:\r\n- The block index is small, a few bytes per block, so pretty much irrelevant in this equation.\r\n- The UTXO database is forever-growing and has to be completely stored at all times. This is the potentially problematic one here, which is why UTXO database growth and UTXO spam is considered such a serious issue.",
