      "body" : "Two thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Many (most?) desktop users will have tor installed via Tor Browser Bundle, which has its SOCKS listener on port 9150 rather than 9050 (which the \"system tor\", eg tor installed via apt-get, does). Some applications that want to use Tor will automatically try both ports, for instance: https://github.com/agl/pond/blob/master/client/client.go#L686\r\n\r\n2. Using Tor opportunistically by default will cause many users who want to use Tor to take no action to configure it since it appears to already be doing what they want it to by default. But, if at some point in the future their Tor process is not running, they will unwittingly fail open!\r\n\r\nSo, I'd recommend **not** using tor automatically when it is found. It would be better to probe for tor (on both port 9050 and 9150, in that order) and if it is found prompt the user \"We noticed you have Tor running. Do you want to connect using it? [Just Once] [Never] [Always (default)]\"\r\n\r\nWhen \"Always\" is selected, a configuration option should be set which causes it to fail closed if tor is not running in the future.",
