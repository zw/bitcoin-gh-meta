      "body" : "@adamierymenko I think most people won't want Bitcoin to become bloated by incorporating network code itself, but if there is a simple way to interface with network code (e.g. Onion control port) then this is simple enough to be included. I do think that ZeroTier would benefit greatly from providing some sort of built-in firewall, especially with public networks like Earth. Encouraging people to connect to Earth isn't something I would currently do unless they could specify prior to connection which ports they would like shared/accessible, which in the case of bitcoin is port 8333.",
