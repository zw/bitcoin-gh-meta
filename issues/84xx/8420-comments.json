I'm not so sure that 10.11 would be a minimum, although I could potentially see it requiring 10.9 or even 10.10, the latter of which did break quite a bit of stuff, and quietly too. I suppose I could contact the guy who made that tutorial and get his opinion.\r\n\r\n_EDIT:_ Heh. It helps to re-read blog posts and such once you actually know how to read them properly. :) [This blog post](http://blog.timschroeder.net/2012/07/03/the-launch-at-login-sandbox-project/) and [this helper app](https://github.com/alexzielenski/StartAtLoginController) seem to confirm that 10.7 is a valid target. So, in theory, it should be possible to move forward.\r\n\r\nPaging @lucasderraugh. Would you mind taking a moment to confirm that my suggestions would work at all, and preferably on 10.7+? Thanks.",
