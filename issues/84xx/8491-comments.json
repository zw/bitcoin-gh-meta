My suggestion is that if a type of address (e.g. IPv6, Onion) always comes back as unreachable (not connection refused), then would it not be apt to recognise that it is the network type that is unsupported rather than it simply being a coincidence. I.e. the node can learn which network types are working and therefore cease attempts to connect to network types currently unavailable.\n",

Currently more than 99% of addresses advertised are unreachable and I foresee that we need to add better logic for pruning these unreachable addresses. I have various ideas in mind, but once this code is added then this would cause addressed from whole networks to be lost between nodes due to them not being able to determine that the node itself is not connected to the network (e.g. IPv6). The node therefore needs to be able to distinguish between whether the node it's trying to connect to is down, or whether it's unable to connect to all types of that address.\n",
