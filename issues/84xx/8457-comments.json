This opens the flood-gates to many more.\r\n\r\nTo solve this more generally I plan on working on a cute little extension RFC to the [JSONRPC 2.0 spec](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). See discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7783#issuecomment-239442267 .\r\n\r\nThis will add a simple form of (in-batch) promise pipelining to JSON-RPC batching, which will allow doing this kind of composition in a more flexible way. Eg `ext_store` and `ext_load` below:\r\n```javascript\r\n[\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"x.x\",\r\n    \"method\": \"getblockhash\",\r\n    \"id\": 0,\r\n    \"params\": [\"123456\"],\r\n    \"ext_store\": True   // Store the result of this request for later use\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"x.x\",\r\n    \"method\": \"getblock\",\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    \"params\": [\r\n        null // Placeholder for argument 0, will be replaced by ext_load below\r\n    ],\r\n    \"ext_load\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"src\": [0, \"result\"],  // Load the output of request id 0, [\"result\"]\r\n            \"dst\": [0]             // into into params[0]\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n]\r\n```\r\nThe effect of which will be:\r\n```javascript\r\ntmp0 = getblockhash(123456);\r\ntmp1 = getblock(tmp0);\r\n```\r\nIn contrast to simple nesting of calls, which would be the alternative extension, this also allows for more complex composition, and re-use of values.\r\n\r\nReturning:\r\n```javascript\r\n[\r\n{\r\n    \"id\": 0,\r\n    \"error\": null,\r\n    \"result\": \"0000000000002917ed80650c6174aac8dfc46f5fe36480aaef682ff6cd83c3ca\"\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    \"error\": null,\r\n    \"result\": {\r\n        \"hash\": ...,\r\n        \"confirmations\": ...,\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n]\r\n```",
