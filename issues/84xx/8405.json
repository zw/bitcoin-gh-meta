However, we don't have a 'restore wallet'.\n\nThere are some difficulties here:\n- Requires a partial rescan (= trouble with pruning)\n- If no keys have been used in the current wallet, it could simply replace the current wallet. However if the current wallet was already used, it is more complicated:\n  - It could refuse in this case\n  - Move the old wallet out of the way\n  - Or try to perform a merge\n\nThis may have be easier with multi-wallet support, where it could copy the backup into the data directory and open it as extra wallet.\n\nSee also #7675.\n",
