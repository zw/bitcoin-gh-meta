   "body" : "This commit introduces a new Checkqueue that should have much better performance than the previous one. Lockfree in scare quotes because the whole checkqueue doesn't meet the strict academic definition of lockfree, but it does have lockfree operations.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes 1 new consensus rule, some refactoring of the checkqueue interface, reimplementation of the checkqueue, and tests, and one optional optimization (could be PR'd separately).\r\n\r\nPlease see https://gist.github.com/JeremyRubin/6eec0427edec6e68755ae274b27baae5 for more information.\r\n\r\nedit: forgot WIP label, needs more testing and review. Opening PR for that purpose.\r\nedit edit: removed WIP label, terminology confusion, it is indeed ready for testing.\r\n\r\n# Todo\r\n- [ ] Stronger Testing Suite\r\n- [ ] Figure out better wakeup mechanism\r\n- [ ] Add Benchmarking to the old checkqueue compatible with the new one.\r\n- [ ] cross platform testing (ARM, 32 bit,...)\r\n- [x] remove static asserts for lock-free ness",
