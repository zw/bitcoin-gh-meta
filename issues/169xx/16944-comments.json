If you rebase on top of this, you can probably drop the \"Enable offline transaction features\" checkbox as well as the \"include watchonly coins\" and \"create unsigned \"checkboxes, in favor of only allowing the functionality with watch-only wallets.\r\n\r\nI like how the send button text changes, so I'll steal that for this PR :-)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"898\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-24 om 13 49 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65509165-219dd100-ded2-11e9-8a3e-c6c9c93dc371.png\">\r\n\r\nOnce we have descriptor wallets and better HWI integration, the simple distinction between watch-only and wallets with private keys will no longer work. For example you might be part of a 2 of 3 multisig, with the keys in the wallet. Or maybe you don't have keys in the Core wallet, but your hardware wallet can sign its part via USB.\r\n\r\nSo in terms of your wizard, I would split into two wizards: one for composing & exporting, and one for loading.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"910\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-24 om 14 09 54\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65511729-1b125800-ded8-11e9-9a77-510e0902fcef.png\">\r\n\r\nThere's probably a step 0 where you attempt to (partially) sign with your own keys and with any connected devices. If that's not enough, then you go to step 1 where you can export the PSBT via clipboard or file system.\r\n\r\nI would introduce a fresh dialog for loading, maybe co-signing and then broadcasting a transaction.

When I call AvailableCoins, I force on fWatchOnly in the CCoinControl object that I hand it, which the code did not previously do even if it was called for (I had to add a flag to ListCoins.) Curiously, it seems like it worked for me _without_ the spendability-related changes that this PR makes. Not sure what's up there.",

If I try to create an unsigned spend by clicking \"Use available balance\" and checking \"Subtract fee from amount\", my transaction shouldn't have a change output.  However, on a wallet where I haven't created a keypool, I get an error message about not having a change address.\r\n\r\n![2019-10-09-10_09_12_440747090](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61096/66516633-30ad8300-ea7d-11e9-8c21-83697fa75e47.png)\r\n\r\nI also get a second error after that error (\"Transaction creation failed\") which seems like error message overkill.\r\n\r\nAfter importing a key to the keypool, this generated the prompt as expected.  However, I hit cancel, tried again, and it failed with the above error message.  It seems it marked the change address it allocated as used even though (1) the transaction didn't include a change address and (2) the PSBT was never sent to the clipboard (so, even if there had been a change address, it would never have been user-accessible).\r\n\r\nAfter importing another single key into the keypool and this time not cancelling, it worked as expected.  I was able to take the PSBT from the clipboard, run it through my other wallet's `walletprocesspsbt`, copy it back, run `finalizepsbt`, run `sendrawtransaction`, and verify it entered the mempool of my connected regtest node.\r\n\r\nI also tried this on a mixed wallet with some private keys and some watch-only keys, and I can confirm that it doesn't work there (as it shouldn't, per the OP).  For reference, I ran everything manually (no HWI) and only tested single-sig on regtest.\r\n\r\nThanks again for working on this!",
