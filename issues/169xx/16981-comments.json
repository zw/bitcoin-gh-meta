      "body" : "**_Note_**: this comment is outdated; the scope of this PR has been reduced.\r\n\r\nRunning `bitcoind --reindex` causes the client to reread the `.bitcoin/blocks/blknnnnn.dat` files and re-derive all the index and chainstate information. It's similar to IBD but the client uses these local files rather than download blocks from the network. As `LoadExternalBlockFile()` reads each block from disk, it checks to see if its parent has already been seen (and processed). If so, then this block can be immediately processed (by giving it to `AcceptBlock()`). If this block's parent hasn't yet been seen, it cannot be processed until after its parent is seen. Its prev-hash (parent's hash) is put into a map of \"pending\" blocks (called `mapBlocksUnknownParent`). Later, when its parent is encountered and processed, this map is consulted to see it has a child that's already been seen that can now be processed. If so, `LoadExternalBlockFile()` now has to go back and re-read the child block from disk (`ReadBlockFromDisk()`), deserialize it again, and then process (pass it to `AcceptBlock()`).\r\n\r\nPerformance isn't very good because about 90% of blocks are read before their parents are read. (I think this is a result of the headers-first IBD performance enhancement of a few years ago.) This can be seen by running `bitcoind --reindex --debug=reindex`, causing many messages like:\r\n```\r\n2019-09-29T00:29:00Z LoadExternalBlockFile: Out of order block 00000000a2268fb2d4ddc0408fae961a96668db58de415d3c9e0a7694eeb1657, parent 000000005fb53da5c3cda78aef28cbc44fde3e435f1dc2ac04df53387049171f not known\r\n```\r\nthen, a short time later:\r\n```\r\n2019-09-29T00:29:00Z LoadExternalBlockFile: Processing out of order child 00000000a2268fb2d4ddc0408fae961a96668db58de415d3c9e0a7694eeb1657 of 000000005fb53da5c3cda78aef28cbc44fde3e435f1dc2ac04df53387049171f\r\n```\r\nSo 90% of blocks end up being read from disk twice (actually, not twice, since the operating system's buffer cache likely still has the data, but there is still a memory-to-memory copy), and deserialized twice.\r\n\r\nThis PR mitigates this problem by taking advantage of the fact that recent blocks are still in the buffer (`blkdat`) that is used to read from the `blk` files. Since rewinding to an earlier offset in the buffer has been fixed by the recently merged #16577, we can see if the child block is still in memory (the probability is increased by making the buffer somewhat larger), and if so, avoid having to read the child block data from disk. It turns out that the child block is still in the buffer 60% of the time. This depends on some randomness that's introduced during IBD, so it may be different for you. (My IBD was done using all the default settings, nothing special.)\r\n\r\nThe second part of this change initially deserializes only the block header, rather than the entire block. since about 90% of the time we're going to have to process this block later; only the `hashPrevBlock` field of the header is needed to determine if we can process this block immediately (if this block's parent has been seen). This does mean that 10% of the time, we deserialize the header, and then immediately also the full block (where it would have been more efficient to simply deserialize the full block), but overall this is a big performance win.\r\n\r\nOn my system, this PR reduces the time to `--reindex` on mainnet by 48 minutes. I encourage reviewers to attempt to replicate my findings. Reindexing has two parts, reading the `blocks/blknnnnn.dat` files (which this PR improves), and then connecting the blocks to the blockchain (the `UpdateTip` messages), which this PR doesn't affect. For me, this PR reduces the first part from 123 to 75 minutes. After you start seeing `UpdateTip` messages, you can stop the client, and you will have the time measurement you need from `debug.log`.",

During the first phase, memory (`VSZ` in the ps output) is about 2.4 gb on my system; afterwards (when it's logging `UpdateTip: new best...`), it's about 3.5 gb. The benefit of a large buffer is that a larger fraction of the out-of-order blocks (that have to be processed later, when their parents are seen) can be found in memory, rather than having to read them again from disk. The \"hit ratio\" with this buffer size is just under 99%. The difference between 160 (but overall buffer size in max-blocks)) and 140 (the rewind limit) determines the size of disk reads (the larger, the better, more efficient).",

      "body" : "@mzumsande, those are very good thoughts, thank you. I will study this further (and invite others to also). One nice thing about this design is that any amount of memory will work, in that it will be an improvement -- it is one of those classic space-time tradeoffs. The idea of making the buffer not have a hard-coded size is intriguing and promising. I think we would not go back to the pre-second iteration (multiple-files), because even reducing the buffer memory to the original amount would be improved by the multi-file version. (That is to say, there is no downside to the latest version here.) That's because all the multi-file commit means is that we do not discard cached data when switching files.\r\n\r\nOne thing I hope I made clear enough in an earlier comment is that I tried to keep the memory usage during reindexing be strictly _less_ than what is needed during normal operation, so that there would be no overall increase in memory demand. We certainly would not want this design to create a *spike* (high water mark) of memory usage. But I was very likely mistaken, since I was not aware that memory could be \"dialed down\" for small environments.",

      "body" : "I force-pushed a reorganization of the commits to make reviewing easier. I split the largest commit, **speed up reindex by reading out-of-order blocks from memory**, into two separate commits:\r\n1. Commit message: **initially deserialize only CBlockHeader, not CBlock**. Deserialize only a block header (only 32 bytes) initially, instead of a full block. The block header is all that's needed to tell us if this block's parent has been seen yet; if not, the block will have to be deserialized later, after its parent is found. Nearly all blocks (89% on my system) are seen before their parents, so this is a big improvement.\r\n1. Commit message: **speed up reindex by reading out-of-order blocks from memory**. If we've just processed a block that's the parent of an earlier-seen block, we must now process that earlier block. Instead of always reading that block from disk, see if it happens to still be in the circular disk read memory buffer ('CBufferedFile blkdat`). This saves a disk read.\r\n\r\nWe could merge the first commit without the second. The first commit is pretty simple; the second commit is a little more involved.\r\n\r\nThese two commits have a buffer size unchanged from master, 8mb (`2*MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE`), so there is no change in memory usage. But with this buffer size, only 29% of the out-of-order blocks are found in the buffer. If we increase the buffer by not too much (as I did in an earlier commit that's now been erased by force-push, 640mb), to 32mb, the \"hit rate\" increases to 50%. This is probably a good space-time balance.\r\n\r\nHere are the block-load times on my system (with all default settings), which is just the first part of reindexing (each row builds on the previous row):\r\n\r\n| version | real time (minutes) |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| master | 130 |\r\n| deserialize only header | 90 |\r\n| look for blocks in buffer, 8mb |84 |\r\n| look for blocks in buffer, 32mb |78 |\r\n| look for blocks in buffer, 640mb |72 |\r\n\r\n(Take with a grain of salt, because the times varied even on identical runs, and a lot probably depends on the specifics of my system.) Keep in mind that this buffer exists only during the block-load part of reindex.",

It must be static, given that it's declared here, since its state must persist across calls to this function (very often, a block and its parent are in different `blk` files). We could eliminate this global state by allocating this map in the caller of this function, `src/init.cpp: ThreadImport()`, and passing it by reference to `LoadExternalBlockFile()`. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that seems missing from the current design is, what happens if there are leftover entries in this map after reindexing has completed? That means we've read blocks from disk but never found their parent blocks. In my testing, this map is empty at the end of reindexing, as expected. But what if it wasn't? That would mean we're missing one or more `blocks/blk00nnn.dat` files, or some blocks from those files. Isn't that worth at least a `LogPrintf()`? Making this change would also require moving the map out to the caller, because this function doesn't know if it will be called again.",

      "body" : "Reviewers, please take a fresh look at the latest force-push; this PR is much better than before. I'll explain from scratch, so it's not necessary to read any of the previous comments in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe previous version of this PR included two separate changes (both affecting `-reindex`):\r\n* initially deserializing only the header instead of the entire block\r\n* when we find a block whose child has already been read, attempt to \"rewind\" in the stream memory buffer to access and process the child (instead of always reading it again from disk)\r\n\r\nThese should always have been separate PRs. This PR now contains only the first change, which is the more effective and localized. I'll make a separate PR for the second change if it turns out to be a significant improvement. _This PR no longer has any effect on memory usage_, which reviewers had concerns about. \r\n\r\nTo go over some basics again, for background: During `-reindex`, blocks are read from disk (the `blocks/blk00???.dat` files), deserialized, and processed. But a block can't be processed if its parent hasn't yet been seen (we know this only after deserializing the block). In that case, its disk location is saved in a map and we go on to the next block. \r\n\r\nWhenever we do successfully process a block (we've got its parent), we check to see if its child has already been seen (is present in the map, looked up by block hash), and, if so, we read the child block from disk (again), deserialize it, and process it (and remove it from the map).\r\n\r\nIt turns out that, due to the \"headers first\" initial block download (IBD) algorithm, over 92% of blocks (on my system) are out of order, in the sense that 92% of the time when we first read a block, we haven't yet seen its parent. You can see these by specifying the `-debug=reindex` option (see the second comment in this PR).\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does -- and now all it does -- is to initially deserialize only the _header_ (80 bytes), not the entire block. From the header, we can tell if this block's parent has already been seen (by its prev-hash). If not (92% of the time), we skip over the rest of the block. So the savings are to not deserialize the entire block in the most common case where that's unnecessary. \r\n\r\nIt's true that if all blocks _were_ in order, this would be slightly slower because we'd deserialize the header, discover that the block's parent is already known, then deserialize the full block. (There's no easy way to deserialize the _rest_ of the block.)\r\n\r\nTo test this change,you may want to apply this patch:\r\n```\r\n--- a/src/init.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/init.cpp\r\n@@ -692,6 +692,7 @@ static void ThreadImport(std::vector<fs::path> vImportFiles)\r\n         pblocktree->WriteReindexing(false);\r\n         fReindex = false;\r\n         LogPrintf(\"Reindexing finished\\n\");\r\n+        StartShutdown();\r\n         // To avoid ending up in a situation without genesis block, re-try initializing (no-op if reindexing worked):\r\n         LoadGenesisBlock(chainparams);\r\n     }\r\n```\r\nThen you can time the reindexing in isolation (without having to look at timestamps in the log file):\r\n```\r\n$ time src/bitcoind --reindex --maxconnections=0\r\n```\r\nSetting `maxconnections` to zero makes the timing less variable, since you can get very different peers each time.\r\n\r\nWhen I run this, I consistently get 83 minutes with this PR's branch, and 125 minutes without, an improvement of 42 minutes.",

      "body" : "Just to clarify, the last bullet point in the [review club writeup](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16981.html): \r\n\r\n> Before this PR, we would always read entire blocks from disk into our buffer. If the predecessor of a block was not available, the blocks would have to be read again at a later point. This PR changes behavior such that initially only the 80 byte block header is read into the buffer, and if we canât accept the block yet, the rest of the block is skipped for now\r\n\r\nis slightly incorrect. Even with this PR, we always read entire blocks from disk (most of them twice); the disk read behavior before and after this PR is exactly the same. The difference is that with this PR, only the _header_ is (initially) deserialized, rather than the entire block, which saves CPU.\r\n\r\nThe `CBufferedFile` object does somewhat large reads, around 4 MB (`MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE`), each of which often includes multiple entire blocks and a partial block (because we don't know where the boundaries are; we don't know how much to read to get exactly a block or blocks). Recent blocks are close to full, so each disk read probably reads in only one or two blocks (plus a partial block). \r\n\r\nBut now I'm wondering if this PR _should_ work as described in the review club comment. We could read only the 80-byte header from disk, and then, if we've seen its parent, read the rest of the block. Two disk reads are less efficient than one large read (a disk read has a fixed overhead and a length-proportional overhead), but that happens only about 8% of the time. If we haven't seen this block's parent (probability 92%), we could _seek_ ahead in the file, instead of reading it into memory. But as explained earlier, there could be _more_ than one block per large read, so we may end up exchanging one large read for 2 or 3 80-byte reads -- hard to say which is better. I'd recommend leaving this PR as is, because it's an (almost) unambiguous improvement on the status quo, and changing it to do 80-byte reads and seeks is more complex than this PR is currently. (The reason I say almost is because, if the blocks are already sorted, this ends up deserializing the header one extra time.)\r\n\r\nI'm just now thinking, we could make `reindex` (part 1) screaming fast by storing the headers in separate \"parallel\" files in the `blocks/` directory: `blk01234.dat` would be the same as now, but there would be a `hdr01234.dat` (similar to the way there's a `rev001234.dat` today) that would be that file's blocks' headers in the same order. Actually, that file would be a sequence of (header, file-offset, size) tuples. The file-offset is the file offset of that block's block in the same-named `blk` file. That's only 100 MB of additional disk space (about 100 bytes times about 1M blocks, this is far less than 1% of the size of the `blocks/` directory). \r\n\r\nThen `-reindex` could do 4 MB reads, same as today except reading the `hdr001234.dat` files, bringing in 50k headers in a single read -- super-efficient. Then loop through each of those, and if the block can be accepted now (its parent has been seen, 8% case), then seek and read from the `blk01234.dat` file (we would know the exact seek offset and the size); that would be slower than today. But the 92% case would be much faster because we wouldn't be reading entire blocks into memory unnecessarily. This would be a significant reduction in the number of disk reads. (Definitely this would be a separate PR.) Opinions?",

      "body" : "This kind of check occurs four places in this file (and was being done before this PR, for example line 256). I like the conciseness of your suggestion, but it loses the check of the exception string. (The test wouldn't detect if a completely different exception occurred.) Another advantage of checking the exception string is that it documents why the exception is thrown (could be in a comment, but code is better).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a variant of `BOOST_CHECK_THROW` that took a string argument. What do you think about implementing this in this file, or in a more general place:\r\n```\r\n#define BOOST_CHECK_THROW_WHAT(statement, exception, str) \\\r\n    do { \\\r\n        try { \\\r\n            statement; \\\r\n            BOOST_CHECK(false); \\\r\n        } catch (const exception& e) { \\\r\n            BOOST_CHECK(strstr(e.what(), str) != nullptr); \\\r\n        } \\\r\n    } while (false)\r\n```\r\nand then replacing the `try/catch` (here and in 3 other places) with:\r\n```\r\n    BOOST_CHECK_THROW_WHAT(bf.Skip(2),\r\n        std::exception, \"Read attempted past buffer limit\");\r\n```\r\n(I tested this.) It's weird to name this macro `BOOST_*` because it's not part of the Boost library, but what it does is so close to `BOOST_CHECK_THROW()` that it may make sense. If the casual reader thinks this is part of Boost, is that so bad?",

      "body" : "These comments create a good opportunity for me to ask some questions about the existing design while doing this PR, hope that's okay. Please don't feel an obligation to answer these.\r\n\r\n- What's the purpose of the `MessageStart()` marker? It seems to allow the skipping over some arbitrary junk that follows a block before the start of the next [marker-nSize-block] sequence of bytes. What could cause that? In other projects, I've seen these markers used when a file gets _overwritten_ (such as a journal file that implements a circular log), because after restart, the previous write offset is unknown. Are these `blk` files overwritten?\r\n- Are we trying to be robust against arbitrary file-overwrite corruption? If the file contains 100 blocks, and data corruption overwrote part of the second block, then this design (searching for the marker) will find the start of the third block and pick up from there and correctly parse the remaining 97 blocks. This sounds good, but the second block's child (or children) will never be \"accepted\" (`AcceptBlock()` called on it), recursively (and not just for this file but for all remaining files), so we'll end up with a very truncated blockchain. What happens then? I think we may download blocks from peers (IBD) starting from where the corruption occurred. That great if true (why don't I actually try this?), although a minor problem is that the many entries in `mapBlocksUnknownParent` are never released since that map is static -- which is kind of weird. But since these (following) blocks are never accepted, the rest of this part 1 of reindex is wasted effort. It may be better to just abort the rest of this part 1 of reindexing if we encounter any file corruption.\r\n\r\n> If the size field of the block was corrupted\r\n\r\nIt's true that this PR increases dependence on this field, but If we're assuming the size can be corrupted, I'm not sure what benefit it can be providing, either with or without this PR. Yes, setting `nRewind` to `nBlockPos+1` would work (I haven't tried it but I could), but it would be significantly slower because we'd have to scan for the next marker (a megabyte or 2 away) one byte at a time.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that if the size field is corrupted, all bets are off, the train's going off the tracks in a hurry.",

      "body" : "> Skip() calls read()\r\n\r\nGood catch, and it's actually even worse, because if we process the block immediately (don't take the `Skip()` path), then we deserialize the entire block (`blkdat >> block`, just below), and that calls `read()` which can read the disk. But that's the less common path (only about 8%).\r\n\r\nAs someone said at review club, the node isn't fully up and running during reindexing, so there probably isn't much contention for this lock. But I think we can avoid this problem; I'll push a fix if it doesn't complicate the code too much.\r\n\r\n> this part could be more concise. I mean adding position + size just do subtract position below, seems a bit redundant.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's redundant; note that `nBlockPos` is the start of the current block (whose header we just read), while `blkdat.GetPos()` returns the current position, which is _after_ the header. We don't want to skip `nSize` bytes (which is the length of the block), we want to skip the _remainder_ of the current block, so the distance to move forward is the start of the next block minus the current position. This could have been written `blkdat.Skip(nSize - 80)` but I think that's not as clear.\r\n\r\nI just noticed that the `SetLimit()` here can be removed; it's not needed when doing a `Skip()` (it's only needed when deserializing something of variable length, such as a block). I'll remove it.",

      "body" : "The main point of `-reindex` now is recovery after on-disk corruption, so I think it makes sense to be as robust to that as we can reasonably be?\r\n\r\nAs well as just random disk corruption, I think you can get problems if (a) you're downloading blocks and your power goes out before the data gets synced; I'd expect you might end up with something like \"...[marker][nSize=1MB][250kB of block data][64kB of zeroes]\" in that case; at which point when you restart you might start writing the next block straight after the zeroes. When running reindex currently, I think your parsing would fail during the 64kB of zeroes, and you'd then scan to the next marker and continue. If so, I guess that means that with this patch, if you ran `-reindex` you'd not see that new block and have to redownload it. That's all speculation though, so don't take my word for it.\r\n\r\nHmm, as an alternative approach, what if you just still read/parse the entire block off the disk, but if it's not one you can immediately accept, you store it into a map for later acceptance? Limit the map to 32MB worth of data, or maybe somehow tie it in to the mempool limit? Keeps the same logic, but reduces the amount of double-reading and double-parsing needed.",

But the node then seemed to get all the missed blocks from peers, and at the end all seemed good.\r\n\r\nAnthony, your suggestion is similar to what this PR originally did before I reduced its scope. You can see the discussion above, but to summarize here, the idea was to increase the size of the circular memory buffer (`CBufferedFile` object) so it could act as a cache, so that we could sometimes access blocks read earlier without having to re-read from disk; the concern was about increasing memory requirements. I think something along the lines I proposed or what you're proposing is likely to help further (especially tying it to mempool limit; that's a good idea), but I suggest keeping this PR limited (no change in memory, a definite improvement) if you don't mind.",

Read from disk the remaining of the block with this `Skip()` call (just buffer it into `blkdat`).\r\n3. If it is out-of-order block, continue with the next block. Notice that even if the data we read from disk in 2. remains buffered in `blkdat`, we will never make use of it because we read out-of-order blocks using `ReadBlockFromDisk()` which will not use our `blkdat` cache and will read the block from disk _again_ (2x read).\r\n4. If it is in-order block, deserialize the cached data from 2.\r\n\r\nWe can do better (find a patch at the bottom of this comment):\r\n\r\n1. Read from disk and deserialize the block header.\r\n2.

      "body" : "Thanks, Vasil. Steps 1 and 2 (in your first list) are not separate disk reads; each disk read generally includes multiple blocks. The `CBufferedFile` object doesn't know (and has no way to know) where the block boundaries are, so it does as large a read as the buffer allows, which is about 4 MB (`MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE = 4000000`). The buffer boundaries and block boundaries aren't synchronized in any way, so each read usually includes a partial block at the end. (Blocks never span `blk00nnn.dat` files.)\r\n\r\nI did consider changing this function to do exactly what you suggest -- read only the block header of each block, and read the rest of the block only if we can accept it immediately. We'd read fewer bytes from disk -- but the tradeoff is that we'd do many more read operations. It's unclear which is better. I suspect it would depend on the underlying kind of disk. I have an SSD, so small reads at different file offsets would probably be efficient, but if it's a spinning disk, doing fewer large reads is probably more efficient since there's less rotational delay.\r\n\r\nAlso, making that change would be more complex.\r\n\r\nDid you time your patch? When your patch sets `nRewind` to the beginning of the next block and takes the `continue` path, that rewind value is used as the argument to `blkdat.SetPos()` at [line 4656](https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/blob/0e2746148225cbef8954b0c1081e135f6f23a661/src/validation.cpp#L4656) in this PR. I added some debug prints, and as I suspected, that `SetPos()` call isn't always doing what we expect. The caller doesn't check its return value (there's much to be desired about this code); if it can't move ahead to the requested position, it [moves ahead as far as it can](https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/blob/0e2746148225cbef8954b0c1081e135f6f23a661/src/streams.h#L816) and returns `false`. \r\n\r\nWhen running your patch, `SetPos()` usually can move to the requested position, but about 30 times per file, it can't because it reaches the end of the buffer (`SetPos` isn't designed to read from disk). We end up usually positioned to the middle of a block, and then [`FindByte()`](https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/blob/0e2746148225cbef8954b0c1081e135f6f23a661/src/validation.cpp#L4663) searches for (and finds) the start of the next block. It works, but obviously it's not very efficient since each byte is inspected individually.\r\n\r\nI think the best way to avoid reading most blocks from disk twice is an idea I described in the last two paragraphs of [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16981#issuecomment-594125403). But that's a much larger change and I don't know if it's worth it. But even if we implement that idea later, I still think this PR, as it is, has a high enough performance improvement to complexity ratio to be merged.",

(Maybe that would be a nice addition to `contrib/`?)\r\n\r\nI did think of a test to convince me that it's working:\r\n\r\nI ran `bitcoind --reindex --maxconnections=0` and let it finish reindexing. Not just the first part that this PR modifies, but the entire reindex procedure, to the point it had logged an `UpdateTip` of a very recent block. Then, of course, it couldn't add new blocks because it had no peers.\r\n\r\nThen I restarted the client without any arguments, and it started syncing at that _very recent block height_ (since now it had peers) and within about a minute was fully synced.\r\n\r\nThis convinces me because once before I'd purposely damaged the first part of reindexing by simulating a disk read error early in the process, which resulted in one block not being processed. The client could not load blocks from that point onward, because this missing block's child couldn't be processed (parent is required), so that child block's child couldn't be processed, and so on, recursively. The system very nicely recovered by going into IBD mode and getting all blocks following that missing block from peers and then running normally.\r\n\r\nIf this PR broke the reindexing process, the same would have happened (it would have started IBD-ing from when the bug introduced damage, probably very early). But it didn't. It picked up downloading from a very recent height, and accepted these blocks (\"`UpdateTip: new best=...`\"), proving that all previous blocks were recorded correctly in the block index.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, does that seem like a good test to you?",

It's about 10% faster, but probably should not be merged because the added complexity isn't worth it. The branch is here (based on this PR's branch plus a single commit): https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/tree/reindex-speedup-thread\r\n\r\nThe idea is to move the delayed processing of child blocks (delayed because the parent wasn't yet available) into a separate thread. This overlaps the child processing with the reading of the block files using the `CBufferedFile` object and deserializing the header, which is a natural separation. If the times to do those two things were equal, this would have given a 2x improvement. But some debug printing shows that processing the child blocks takes the majority of the time (the parent thread ends up waiting for the child thread near the bottom of the function). And, unfortunately, the processing of child blocks can't be multithreaded, because each child depends on its parent. (If there was a long chain split, it may be possible to process the two chains in parallel, but those are very rare.)",

On mainnet, it's more like 24 minutes. I think the difference is that testnet blocks are smaller and less complex on average, so the savings of deserializing only the header instead of the entire block is less. If you still have your `debug.log` files, how much time was there between reindexing the first block file and `Reindexing finished`? That's the only phase of reindexing that this PR changes. I suspect there is enough randomness in the entire reindex that the 4 minutes advantage on testnet can be lost in the noise. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion, if you could try it again, is to start `bitcoind` with the `-maxconnections=0`. I think each time you start `bitcoind` you can get a different set of peers, and different peers can put a different load on your node, so not having any peers reduces the variance, at least that's been my experience.",

      "body" : "@hebasto, thank you for doing all those tests. I did more testing (that's why I changed this PR to a Draft), and I'm now convinced there's no functionally important difference between master and this PR when there's data corruption in the `blk.dat` files. There can be a behavior and timing difference, but I don't think it matters. The behavior difference (as you have explained) is that if there's corruption in the middle of a block's serialization on disk, it's most likely not in the header, and because this PR only initially deserializes the header, the corruption isn't detected immediately. master deserializes the entire block, so it detects it immediately.\r\n\r\nAssume there's corruption in the middle of a block (not in the header). This happens within `LoadExternalBlockFile()`:\r\n\r\nWith master, the ``blkdat >> block`` throws an exception, this is caught and the `catch` handler prints \"`Deserialize or I/O error`\", and we move on to the next block. So it was as if that block didn't exist in the `blk.dat` files.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the same thing happens if the block can be processed immediately (that is, if we've already seen its parent). Otherwise, an entry gets added to \r\n`mapBlocksUnknownParent` and we move on to the next block, and the corruption is undetected for now. A short time later, we reach this corrupt block's parent and then call `ReadBlockFromDisk()` on the corrupt block, which detects the corruption, logs the error, and returns `false`. `LoadExternalBlockFile()` just continues, so, again, it's as if this block didn't exist in the `blk.dat` files.\r\n\r\n_In both cases_ (with and without this PR), subsequent blocks no longer have `AcceptBlock()` called on them, because the chain is broken (the corrupt block is a missing link in the blockchain unless the block happens to not be part of the best chain, which is unlikely). All these blocks just get added to `mapBlocksUnknownParent` (and never removed and processed).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Here's a patch to simulate corruption</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/validation.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/validation.cpp\r\n@@ -4720,8 +4720,20 @@ void LoadExternalBlockFile(const CChainParams& chainparams, FILE* fileIn, FlatFi\r\n                     if (hash != chainparams.GetConsensus().hashGenesisBlock && !LookupBlockIndex(block.hashPrevBlock)) {\r\n                         LogPrint(BCLog::REINDEX, \"%s: Out of order block %s, parent %s not known\\n\", __func__, hash.ToString(),\r\n                                 block.hashPrevBlock.ToString());\r\n-                        if (dbp)\r\n-                            mapBlocksUnknownParent.insert(std::make_pair(block.hashPrevBlock, *dbp));\r\n+                        static bool docorrupt = true;\r\n+                        // simulate corruption in the first block that doesn't have a parent yet\r\n+                        if (dbp) {\r\n+                            if (docorrupt) {\r\n+                                // Simulate corruption in the first block that can't be processed\r\n+                                // immediately (that's when there's a difference between master\r\n+                                // and the PR) -- don't add an entry to mapBlocksUnknownParent.\r\n+                                docorrupt = false;\r\n+                                LogPrintf(\"%s: simulate corruption block %s, parent %s\\n\", __func__, hash.ToString(),\r\n+                                        block.hashPrevBlock.ToString());\r\n+                            } else {\r\n+                                mapBlocksUnknownParent.insert(std::make_pair(block.hashPrevBlock, *dbp));\r\n+                            }\r\n+                        }\r\n                         continue;\r\n                     }\r\n \r\n@@ -4778,13 +4790,13 @@ void LoadExternalBlockFile(const CChainParams& chainparams, FILE* fileIn, FlatFi\r\n                     }\r\n                 }\r\n             } catch (const std::exception& e) {\r\n-                LogPrintf(\"%s: Deserialize or I/O error - %s\\n\", __func__, e.what());\r\n+                LogPrintf(\"%s: Deserialize or I/O error - %s pos %s offset %d\\n\", __func__, e.what(), dbp->ToString(), blkdat.GetPos());\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n     } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {\r\n         AbortNode(std::string(\"System error: \") + e.what());\r\n     }\r\n-    LogPrintf(\"Loaded %i blocks from external file in %dms\\n\", nLoaded, GetTimeMillis() - nStart);\r\n+    LogPrintf(\"Loaded %i blocks from external file in %dms mapBlocksUnknownParent size %i\\n\", nLoaded, GetTimeMillis() - nStart, mapBlocksUnknownParent.size());\r\n }\r\n \r\n void CChainState::CheckBlockIndex(const Consensus::Params& consensusParams)\r\n```\r\n(The final `LogPrintf` in the function also prints the number of entries in `mapBlocksUnknownParent`.) \r\n</details>\r\n\r\nHere's the output when I run this on master on testnet:\r\n```\r\n2020-07-30T19:55:07Z Reindexing block file blk00000.dat...\r\n2020-07-30T19:55:11Z Loaded 753 blocks from external file in 3837ms mapBlocksUnknownParent size 85998\r\n2020-07-30T19:55:11Z Reindexing block file blk00001.dat...\r\n2020-07-30T19:55:14Z Loaded 0 blocks from external file in 2985ms mapBlocksUnknownParent size 139893\r\n2020-07-30T19:55:14Z Reindexing block file blk00002.dat...\r\n2020-07-30T19:55:17Z Loaded 0 blocks from external file in 3162ms mapBlocksUnknownParent size 202285\r\n(...)\r\n2020-07-30T20:05:43Z Reindexing block file blk00185.dat...\r\n2020-07-30T20:05:47Z Loaded 0 blocks from external file in 3997ms mapBlocksUnknownParent size 1781217\r\n```\r\nIt's always zero blocks loaded from then on.

      "body" : "#### TL;DR\r\nI think the PR is good as it is can and should be merged.\r\n\r\n@hebasto, I understand exactly what's going on, and having that corrupted file really helped, thanks. Before explaining what I found, can you try a different fix, this will confirm my understanding. At [this point](https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/blob/5b1e92f539c24b6518f577b92874ccac0bbf617f/src/validation.cpp#L4730) in `LoadExternalBlockFile()`:\r\n```\r\n// Skip the rest of this block; position to the marker before the next block.\r\nnRewind = nBlockPos + nSize;\r\n```\r\nJust comment out that setting of `nRewind`. I expect that all the blocks will load (you won't see `Loaded 0 blocks...` messages).\r\n\r\n#### Explanation\r\nThere's a bad block whose [marker bytes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c93623be20d534bb653410db03d38152135e2e6/src/chainparams.cpp#L97), 0xf9, 0xbe, 0xb4, 0xd9, start at offset 0x3147657. The size field that follows is 0xf3afd = 998141, which is reasonable. This is the number of bytes of the serialized block. If you move ahead that many bytes in the stream, you should be at the marker bytes of the next block (or be at the end of the file). That should be 0x3147657 + 4 + 4 + 998141 = 0x323b15c. Looking at that part of the hex dump of the file, we see:\r\n```\r\n0323b150  ac ad 21 07 00 f9 be b4  d9 03 3b 0f 00 02 00 00  |..!.......;.....|\r\n```\r\nThat's 16 bytes, and offset 0xc should be the next marker bytes, but instead we see the marker bytes starting at offset 0x5. These are the marker bytes for a legitimate block, and if we don't load it, all subsequent blocks will have no parent.\r\n\r\nSo, with the PR, what happens is, we deserialize just the header, and it's probably impossible for that to fail because it's just 80 bytes and everything is fixed-sized. Its parent isn't found (of course, since its prevhash is garbage, doesn't even start with zeros), so we add an entry to `mapBlocksUnknownParent[]`, and then _skip ahead_ to where we think the next block's marker bytes start. But that's just beyond where the marker bytes are, so miss that entire block. We get resynchronized (`FindByte()`) with the _following_ block.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, with master, the attempt to deserialize the entire block fails, so we resynchronize starting at the byte after that bad block's first marker byte, and thus we do find and load this block.\r\n\r\nThe additional call to `CheckProofOfWork()` that @hebasto [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16981#issuecomment-664474119) acts here as a sanity-check on the block header, which this nonsense header fails, so then again we attempt to resynchronize starting at the byte after that bad block's first marker byte, and we find the next block.\r\n\r\nSo, a way to summarize the problem is that this PR makes the block size (that follows the marker bytes, `nSize`) more important than it is with master. On master, when we fail to deserialize the block, we go back to resynchronizing with the stream (looking for the marker bytes) and the block size isn't used.\r\n\r\nOne thing we can do to fix this in this PR is that, after deserializing just the header, if its parent hasn't been seen, then after adding it to `mapBlocksUnknownParent`, we could resynchronize with the stream, instead of just skipping ahead by the size of the block. We can do that by removing [this line](https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/blob/5b1e92f539c24b6518f577b92874ccac0bbf617f/src/validation.cpp#L4730). But that would be much slower. \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>I coded a patch to speed up `FindByte()`</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/streams.h\r\n+++ b/src/streams.h\r\n@@ -851,12 +851,21 @@ public:\r\n \r\n     //! search for a given byte in the stream, and remain positioned on it\r\n     void FindByte(char ch) {\r\n+        // start is the index into vchBuf[] at which to start searching\r\n+        size_t start = nReadPos % vchBuf.size();\r\n         while (true) {\r\n             if (nReadPos == nSrcPos)\r\n                 Fill();\r\n-            if (vchBuf[nReadPos % vchBuf.size()] == ch)\r\n-                break;\r\n-            nReadPos++;\r\n+            size_t n = vchBuf.size() - start;\r\n+            if (n > nSrcPos - nReadPos)\r\n+                n = nSrcPos - nReadPos;\r\n+            auto it_start = vchBuf.begin()+start;\r\n+            auto it_find = std::find(it_start, it_start+n, ch);\r\n+            size_t inc = it_find - it_start;\r\n+            nReadPos += inc;\r\n+            if (inc < n) break;\r\n+            start += inc;\r\n+            if (start >= vchBuf.size()) start = 0;\r\n         }\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nAnd this works, and is much faster (`std::find()` seems to be very efficient in this case).\r\n\r\nBut on further reflection, I don't think we should do this, because this fixes only this specific kind of file corruption -- _this problem can happen anyway_. There can be all kinds of corruption that makes a block unserializable, and once that happens, all subsequent blocks cannot be loaded. But I have seen that when this occurs, the node is able to download blocks from peers and synchronize with the network anyway. It's true that it doesn't seem to _correct_  damaged `blk.dat` files, but if that's worth doing, it should be for a separate PR.\r\n\r\nBut I'll do some benchmarking to see if this resynchronizing (with the faster `FindByte()`) is close to the PR as it is now, and if it's only a few percent slower, maybe it's worth doing. I'll give an update later.",

I'd suggest to separate the `FindByte()` patch into a dedicated PR that will allow to measure each optimization approach individually.\r\n\r\n2. Resynchronizing on each out-of-order block (commenting out `nRewind = nBlockPos + nSize;`) indeed improves robustness. Let's compare two solutions:\r\n- resynchronizing on each header that fails `CheckProofOfWork()` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16981#issuecomment-664474119) has a small constant time (optimized hashing) overhead per each block\r\n- resynchronizing on each out-of-order block has a much greater time overhead (reading operations) per each out-of-order block, and the number of such blocks can vary from user to user. Moreover, this approach inserts into `mapBlocksUnknownParent` a piece of junk that will cause additional time overhead while searching through this map\r\n\r\nTherefore, I'd strictly prefer the former approach.\r\n\r\n3.

      "body" : "Thanks for the excellent and helpful review!\r\n\r\n> It looks like we're deserializing the header twice now\r\n\r\nYes, but since the header is only 80 bytes (less than 0.01% of a 1 MB block), this likely isn't much of a problem. Besides, I don't think it's possible to deserialize a header, and then deserialize only the _rest_ of the block, and end up with a `CBlock`.\r\n\r\n> the amount of code executed under cs_main lock increases, since it is now used during the entire block deserialization ...\r\n> you could release/reacquire the lock before/after the block serialization\r\n\r\nYes, good point, I implemented a patch to not hold `cs_main` while deserializing the block (then it's acquired and released 3 times per block read from disk, rather than once). The result was that the reindex time was slower by 15 minutes -- only about 1% but still measurable (although I don't know how much of that difference is due to random variation). I think not much else is going on during reindex; there are other threads in the system but they're just sleeping, so I don't think it's okay to leave it as it is.",

That's not as dramatic but still significant. \r\n\r\nThe reindex time was probably affected by the following configuration settings (which are the default for myNode, but I don't know what all these do):\r\n```\r\ntxindex=1\r\ndbcache=1000\r\nmaxorphantx=10\r\nmaxmempool=250\r\nmaxconnections=40\r\nmaxuploadtarget=1000\r\n```\r\nEnabling `txindex` definitely slows down reindex, so without that option, the percentage improvement from this PR would increase slightly (but I don't know by how much). Tor was also enabled, but I don't think that affects reindex time.\r\n\r\nI recall that IBD on this myNode took 2 or 3 weeks (I wish I had measured it, I can do that if anyone's interested), so, at least on this hardware, doing a reindex is a much better option than a full IBD, to minimize both elapsed time and network usage.",

This set of reindexes was ran both on `bitcoin:master` branch as well as on `LarryRuane:reindex-speedup` f8f9ba31f.\r\n\r\nOn my laptop, reindexing took 1h43 mins on average (n=3) on `master` branch. On f8f9ba31f, the average (n=3) took only 1h13m, a decrease of 29%.\r\nOn my Raspberry Pi 4, reindexing took 18h46 mins on average (n=2) on `master` branch. On f8f9ba31f, the average (n=2) took only 13h27m, a decrease of 28%.\r\n\r\nAcross all these runs, the maximum runtime difference on each setup was < 4%, so even though sample size is pretty small, the results look quite reliable.",

Just to make sure the performance improvement still exists, I reindexed testnet3 (it's much faster than mainnet), and with this PR in its current form, the time to read the block files (set up the block index) is 8 minutes, and without this PR, the time is 13 minutes.",

I didn't like the fact that `FillBufferUpToLength()` would call `Fill()` but would _not_ progress `m_read_pos`. With this change, (what's now called) `ReadBufferOnceUpToLength()` both progress `m_read_pos` and calls `Fill()` if necessary, without doing any looping.\r\n\r\nBesides feeling more intuitive (to me), it also allows for some more code cleanup. My main concern is that in `read()` we now progress `m_read_pos` _before_ copying it to `dst`, so if something fails there we'd need to rewind the buffer. I don't actually see that be a problem, but wanted to mention it in case I'm missing something?\r\n\r\nOh and I reverted everything back to `uint64_t`, since those are the types used for `CBufferedFile`'s relevant members? Hopefully that'll fix the CI issues, but I'm a bit out of my depth here.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n\r\ndiff --git a/src/streams.h b/src/streams.h\r\nindex 23e617e56..dbc6e4c03 100644\r\n--- a/src/streams.h\r\n+++ b/src/streams.h\r\n@@ -629,15 +629,18 @@ private:\r\n         return true;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n-    //!
