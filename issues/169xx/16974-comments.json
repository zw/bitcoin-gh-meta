Given the relative unimportance of `pindexBestHeader` maybe this is fine, but in that case maybe it should be documented as \"A block header that is at least as good as the active tip, and not known to be invalid. We optimistically try to keep it at the best block header under those constraints, but this is not guaranteed.\" or so.\r\n\r\nAn alternative (open for consideration, I'm not convinced this is necessary) is to build something similar to `setBlockIndexCandidates` for headers without the have-had-full-transactions requirements, and use its tip instead of `pindexBestHeader`.\r\n",
