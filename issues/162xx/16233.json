It is also possible to ssh-connect to the build-instances for more detailed debugging. The cache tool is also super flexible.\r\n\r\nThe only missing thing is public view access to the build progress and log. :(\r\nOne of the co-founders said that public access is planned for later this year.\r\n\r\nIntegration with GitHub is possible today and the build state (failed/succeeded) is visible for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis is WIP PR would add three environments (ARM/X86/W64 depends build with proper caching).",
