To be honest I don't fully grok the init code so I can't provide a good review there.\r\n\r\nRelating to this wallets/ directory issue though, I wonder if in the case of #15240, it would have been desired for bitcoind to create a wallets/ directory on first run, even if `/var/local/lib/bitcoind` already exists (it would have been created by a sysadmin).\r\n\r\nThere must be some elegant solution to all this, but I don't have any great ideas to offer.",

If there is an existing datadir but no wallets directory it's assumed to be an old data directory, and creating `wallets` would effectively hide the existing wallets in the top level dir, possibly leading to people to suspect loss of funds. \r\n\r\nThere would be other possibilities such as checking for any existing wallets first, but that was deemed more dangerous: no naming convention was enforced for wallets before, so it's non-trivial and brittle to do this detection.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of discussion around this at the time.\r\n\r\nI guess there could be another heuristic: if the datadir is *completely empty*, do create the wallets directory. Then again, it's kind of piling on hacks (do you want to exclude `bitcoin.conf` in this count?) I wish there was a better way.",
