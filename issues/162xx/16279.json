It's just two rather-nice (IMO) cleanups.\r\n\r\nIn practice this means that CheckBlock+ContextualCheckBlock are\r\ncalled with a passed-in CValidationState before we move onto\r\nconnecting the best chain. This makes conceptual sense as these\r\ncalls represent the DoS checks on a block (ie PoW and malleability)\r\nwhich the caller almost certainly wants to know about right away\r\nand shouldn't have to wait on a callback for (and other\r\nvalidationinterface clients shouldn't care about someone submitting\r\nbogus malleated blocks to PNB).\r\n\r\nThis also makes it much, much easier to move the best chain\r\nactivation logic to a background thread as it implies that if PNB\r\nreturns with a IsValid() CValidationState we don't need to care\r\nabout trying to process (non-malleated) copies of the block from\r\nother peers.",
