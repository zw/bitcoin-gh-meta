Active observers\n+* can still obtain the message length (ex. active ciphertext bit flipping or\n+* traffic shemantics analysis)\n+*\n+* The AEAD is constructed as follows: generate two ChaCha20 streams, initially\n+* keyed with K_1 and K_2 and IV of 0 and a block counter of 0 and a sequence\n+* number 0 as IV. After encrypting 4064 bytes, the following 32 bytes are used to\n+* re-key the ChaCha20 context.\n+*\n+* Byte-level forward security is possible by precomputing 4096 bytes of stream\n+* output, caching it, resetting the key to the final 32 bytes of the output, and\n+* then wiping the remaining 4064 bytes of cached data as it gets used.\n+*\n+* For each packet, use 3 bytes from the remaining ChaCha20 stream generated using\n+* K_1 to encrypt the length. Use additional 32 bytes of the same stream to\n+* generate a Poly1305 key.\n+*\n+* If we reach bytes 4064 on the ChaCha20 stream, use the next 32 bytes (byte\n+* 4065-4096) and set is as the new ChaCha20 key, reset the counter to 0 while\n+* incrementing the sequence number + 1 and set is as IV (little endian encoding).\n+*\n+* For the payload, use the ChaCha20 stream keyed with K_1 and apply the same\n+* re-key rules.\n+*\n+*\n+* ==== Packet Handling ====\n+*\n+* When receiving a packet, the length must be decrypted first. When 3 bytes of\n+* ciphertext length have been received, they MUST be decrypted.\n+*\n+* Once the entire packet has been received, the MAC MUST be checked before\n+* decryption. A per-packet Poly1305 key is generated as described above and the\n+* MAC tag is calculated using Poly1305 with this key over the ciphertext of the\n+* packet length and the payload together. The calculated MAC is then compared in\n+* constant time with the one appended to the packet and the packet decrypted\n+* using ChaCha20 as described above (with K_2, the packet sequence number as\n+* nonce and a starting block counter of 1).\n+*\n+* Detection of an invalid MAC MUST lead to immediate connection termination.\n+*\n+* To send a packet, first encode the 3 byte length and encrypt it using the\n+* ChaCha20 stream keyed with K_1 as described above. Encrypt the packet payload\n+* (using the ChaCha20 stream keyed with K_2) and append it to the encrypted\n+* length. Finally, calculate a MAC tag and append it.\n+*/\n+\n+const int KEYSTREAM_SIZE = 4096;\n+\n+class ChaCha20ReKey4096 {\n+private:\n+    ChaCha20 m_ctx;\n+    uint64_t m_seqnr{0};\n+    size_t m_keystream_pos{0};\n+    unsigned char m_keystream[KEYSTREAM_SIZE] = {0};\n+public:\n+    ~ChaCha20ReKey4096();\n+    void SetKey(const unsigned char* key, size_t keylen);\n+    void Crypt(const unsigned char* input, unsigned char* output, size_t bytes);\n+};\n \n class ChaCha20Poly1305AEAD\n {\n private:\n-    ChaCha20 m_chacha_main;                                      // payload and poly1305 key-derivation cipher instance\n-    ChaCha20 m_chacha_header;                                    // AAD cipher instance (encrypted length)\n-    unsigned char m_aad_keystream_buffer[CHACHA20_ROUND_OUTPUT]; // aad keystream cache\n-    uint64_t m_cached_aad_seqnr;                                 // aad keystream cache hint\n+    ChaCha20ReKey4096 m_chacha_main;                                      // payload and poly1305 key-derivation cipher instance\n+    ChaCha20ReKey4096 m_chacha_header;                                    // AAD cipher instance (encrypted length)\n \n public:\n     ChaCha20Poly1305AEAD(const unsigned char* K_1, size_t K_1_len, const unsigned char* K_2, size_t K_2_len);\n \n     explicit ChaCha20Poly1305AEAD(const ChaCha20Poly1305AEAD&) = delete;\n \n     /** Encrypts/decrypts a packet\n-        seqnr_payload, the message sequence number\n-        seqnr_aad, the messages AAD sequence number which allows reuse of the AAD keystream\n-        aad_pos, position to use in the AAD keystream to encrypt the AAD\n         dest, output buffer, must be of a size equal or larger then CHACHA20_POLY1305_AEAD_AAD_LEN + payload (+ POLY1305_TAG_LEN in encryption) bytes\n         destlen, length of the destination buffer\n         src, the AAD+payload to encrypt or the AAD+payload+MAC to decrypt\n         src_len, the length of the source buffer\n         is_encrypt, set to true if we encrypt (creates and appends the MAC instead of verifying it)\n         */\n-    bool Crypt(uint64_t seqnr_payload, uint64_t seqnr_aad, int aad_pos, unsigned char* dest, size_t dest_len, const unsigned char* src, size_t src_len, bool is_encrypt);\n+    bool Crypt(unsigned char* dest, size_t dest_len, const unsigned char* src, size_t src_len, bool is_encrypt);\n \n-    /** decrypts the 3 bytes AAD data and decodes it into a uint32_t field */\n-    bool GetLength(uint32_t* len24_out, uint64_t seqnr_aad, int aad_pos, const uint8_t* ciphertext);\n+    /** decrypts the 3 bytes AAD data (the packet length) and decodes it into a uint32_t field\n+        the ciphertext will not be manipulated but the AEAD state changes (can't be called multiple times)",

The second instance,\n- * keyed by K_2, is used in conjunction with poly1305 to build an AEAD\n- * (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) that is used to encrypt and\n- * authenticate the entire packet.\n- *\n- * Two separate cipher instances are used here so as to keep the packet lengths\n- * confidential but not create an oracle for the packet payload cipher by\n- * decrypting and using the packet length prior to checking the MAC. By using an\n- * independently-keyed cipher instance to encrypt the length, an active attacker\n- * seeking to exploit the packet input handling as a decryption oracle can learn\n- * nothing about the payload contents or its MAC (assuming key derivation,\n- * ChaCha20 and Poly1305 are secure).\n- *\n- * The AEAD is constructed as follows: for each packet, generate a Poly1305 key by\n- * taking the first 256 bits of ChaCha20 stream output generated using K_2, an IV\n- * consisting of the packet sequence number encoded as an LE uint64 and a ChaCha20\n- * block counter of zero. The K_2 ChaCha20 block counter is then set to the\n- * little-endian encoding of 1 (i.e. {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}) and this instance\n- * is used for encryption of the packet payload.\n- *\n- * ==== Packet Handling ====\n- *\n- * When receiving a packet, the length must be decrypted first. When 3 bytes of\n- * ciphertext length have been received, they may be decrypted.\n- *\n- * A ChaCha20 round always calculates 64bytes which is sufficient to crypt 21\n- * times a 3 bytes length field (21*3 = 63). The length field sequence number can\n- * thus be used 21 times (keystream caching).\n- *\n- * The length field must be enc-/decrypted with the ChaCha20 keystream keyed with\n- * K_1 defined by block counter 0, the length field sequence number in little\n- * endian and a keystream position from 0 to 60.\n- *\n- * Once the entire packet has been received, the MAC MUST be checked before\n- * decryption. A per-packet Poly1305 key is generated as described above and the\n- * MAC tag calculated using Poly1305 with this key over the ciphertext of the\n- * packet length and the payload together. The calculated MAC is then compared in\n- * constant time with the one appended to the packet and the packet decrypted\n- * using ChaCha20 as described above (with K_2, the packet sequence number as\n- * nonce and a starting block counter of 1).\n- *\n- * Detection of an invalid MAC MUST lead to immediate connection termination.\n- *\n- * To send a packet, first encode the 3 byte length and encrypt it using K_1 as\n- * described above. Encrypt the packet payload (using K_2) and append it to the\n- * encrypted length. Finally, calculate a MAC tag and append it.\n- *\n- * The initiating peer MUST use <code>K_1_A, K_2_A</code> to encrypt messages on\n- * the send channel, <code>K_1_B, K_2_B</code> MUST be used to decrypt messages on\n- * the receive channel.\n- *\n- * The responding peer MUST use <code>K_1_A, K_2_A</code> to decrypt messages on\n- * the receive channel, <code>K_1_B, K_2_B</code> MUST be used to encrypt messages\n- * on the send channel.\n- *\n- * Optimized implementations of ChaCha20-Poly1305@bitcoin are relatively fast in\n- * general, therefore it is very likely that encrypted messages require not more\n- * CPU cycles per bytes then the current unencrypted p2p message format\n- * (ChaCha20/Poly1305 versus double SHA256).\n- *\n- * The initial packet sequence numbers are 0.\n- *\n- * K_2 ChaCha20 cipher instance (payload) must never reuse a {key, nonce} for\n- * encryption nor may it be used to encrypt more than 2^70 bytes under the same\n- * {key, nonce}.\n- *\n- * K_1 ChaCha20 cipher instance (length field/AAD) must never reuse a {key, nonce,\n- * position-in-keystream} for encryption nor may it be used to encrypt more than\n- * 2^70 bytes under the same {key, nonce}.\n- *\n- * We use message sequence numbers for both communication directions.\n- */\n+The chacha20-poly1305@bitcoin cipher requires two 256 bits of key material as\n+* output from the key exchange.

Each key (K_1 and K_2) are used by two separate\n- * instances of chacha20.\n- *\n- * The instance keyed by K_1 is a stream cipher that is used only to encrypt the 3\n- * byte packet length field and has its own sequence number. The second instance,\n- * keyed by K_2, is used in conjunction with poly1305 to build an AEAD\n- * (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) that is used to encrypt and\n- * authenticate the entire packet.\n- *\n- * Two separate cipher instances are used here so as to keep the packet lengths\n- * confidential but not create an oracle for the packet payload cipher by\n- * decrypting and using the packet length prior to checking the MAC. By using an\n- * independently-keyed cipher instance to encrypt the length, an active attacker\n- * seeking to exploit the packet input handling as a decryption oracle can learn\n- * nothing about the payload contents or its MAC (assuming key derivation,\n- * ChaCha20 and Poly1305 are secure).\n- *\n- * The AEAD is constructed as follows: for each packet, generate a Poly1305 key by\n- * taking the first 256 bits of ChaCha20 stream output generated using K_2, an IV\n- * consisting of the packet sequence number encoded as an LE uint64 and a ChaCha20\n- * block counter of zero. The K_2 ChaCha20 block counter is then set to the\n- * little-endian encoding of 1 (i.e. {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}) and this instance\n- * is used for encryption of the packet payload.\n- *\n- * ==== Packet Handling ====\n- *\n- * When receiving a packet, the length must be decrypted first. When 3 bytes of\n- * ciphertext length have been received, they may be decrypted.\n- *\n- * A ChaCha20 round always calculates 64bytes which is sufficient to crypt 21\n- * times a 3 bytes length field (21*3 = 63). The length field sequence number can\n- * thus be used 21 times (keystream caching).\n- *\n- * The length field must be enc-/decrypted with the ChaCha20 keystream keyed with\n- * K_1 defined by block counter 0, the length field sequence number in little\n- * endian and a keystream position from 0 to 60.\n- *\n- * Once the entire packet has been received, the MAC MUST be checked before\n- * decryption. A per-packet Poly1305 key is generated as described above and the\n- * MAC tag calculated using Poly1305 with this key over the ciphertext of the\n- * packet length and the payload together. The calculated MAC is then compared in\n- * constant time with the one appended to the packet and the packet decrypted\n- * using ChaCha20 as described above (with K_2, the packet sequence number as\n- * nonce and a starting block counter of 1).\n- *\n- * Detection of an invalid MAC MUST lead to immediate connection termination.\n- *\n- * To send a packet, first encode the 3 byte length and encrypt it using K_1 as\n- * described above. Encrypt the packet payload (using K_2) and append it to the\n- * encrypted length. Finally, calculate a MAC tag and append it.\n- *\n- * The initiating peer MUST use <code>K_1_A, K_2_A</code> to encrypt messages on\n- * the send channel, <code>K_1_B, K_2_B</code> MUST be used to decrypt messages on\n- * the receive channel.\n- *\n- * The responding peer MUST use <code>K_1_A, K_2_A</code> to decrypt messages on\n- * the receive channel, <code>K_1_B, K_2_B</code> MUST be used to encrypt messages\n- * on the send channel.\n- *\n- * Optimized implementations of ChaCha20-Poly1305@bitcoin are relatively fast in\n- * general, therefore it is very likely that encrypted messages require not more\n- * CPU cycles per bytes then the current unencrypted p2p message format\n- * (ChaCha20/Poly1305 versus double SHA256).\n- *\n- * The initial packet sequence numbers are 0.\n- *\n- * K_2 ChaCha20 cipher instance (payload) must never reuse a {key, nonce} for\n- * encryption nor may it be used to encrypt more than 2^70 bytes under the same\n- * {key, nonce}.\n- *\n- * K_1 ChaCha20 cipher instance (length field/AAD) must never reuse a {key, nonce,\n- * position-in-keystream} for encryption nor may it be used to encrypt more than\n- * 2^70 bytes under the same {key, nonce}.\n- *\n- * We use message sequence numbers for both communication directions.\n- */\n+The chacha20-poly1305@bitcoin cipher requires two 256 bits of key material as\n+* output from the key exchange.

Finally, calculate a MAC tag and append it.\n- *\n- * The initiating peer MUST use <code>K_1_A, K_2_A</code> to encrypt messages on\n- * the send channel, <code>K_1_B, K_2_B</code> MUST be used to decrypt messages on\n- * the receive channel.\n- *\n- * The responding peer MUST use <code>K_1_A, K_2_A</code> to decrypt messages on\n- * the receive channel, <code>K_1_B, K_2_B</code> MUST be used to encrypt messages\n- * on the send channel.\n- *\n- * Optimized implementations of ChaCha20-Poly1305@bitcoin are relatively fast in\n- * general, therefore it is very likely that encrypted messages require not more\n- * CPU cycles per bytes then the current unencrypted p2p message format\n- * (ChaCha20/Poly1305 versus double SHA256).\n- *\n- * The initial packet sequence numbers are 0.\n- *\n- * K_2 ChaCha20 cipher instance (payload) must never reuse a {key, nonce} for\n- * encryption nor may it be used to encrypt more than 2^70 bytes under the same\n- * {key, nonce}.\n- *\n- * K_1 ChaCha20 cipher instance (length field/AAD) must never reuse a {key, nonce,\n- * position-in-keystream} for encryption nor may it be used to encrypt more than\n- * 2^70 bytes under the same {key, nonce}.\n- *\n- * We use message sequence numbers for both communication directions.\n- */\n+The chacha20-poly1305@bitcoin cipher requires two 256 bits of key material as\n+* output from the key exchange.
