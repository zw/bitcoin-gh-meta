Therefore most likely it is that around that time linux package installers for Darwin switched from primarily using Fink or Macports to Homebrew, and Fink uses different locations for base and build system installing. A mixture of base packages installed by Fink and Ports and Brew on the same system is a user choice/error.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could put the fix in as is and try to help the few users that might be affected to repair their old OSX 10.6 systems properly? I can hang-out on #bitcoin-build for support if necessary.",
