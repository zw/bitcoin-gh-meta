I hope this doesn't conflict with @sipa's or @jtimon's next steps.\r\n\r\nThis work moves the logic for writing custom core classes to scripts out of CScript. Those classes can describe how their data should be written to a script, and CScript does so without further knowledge.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the entire PR's diffstat while reviewing as it won't be at all helpful. Individual commits will make much more sense.\r\n\r\nAlso, CScriptBinaryData is a pretty terrible name but I couldn't come up with anything better. Suggestions welcome.",
