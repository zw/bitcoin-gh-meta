Need something to go on here...\r\n\r\nI've seen some of our sanity checks fail on OSX (as intended) when I screwed up my toolchain (libstdc++ vs libc++ abi incompatibilities).\r\n\r\nWhat's unique about your build env? My first guess (complete stab in the dark) would be that you've built against a newer sdk without specifying 10.6 back-compat. Newer SDKs change libstdc++ symbol visibility so that exceptions aren't caught at runtime in older environments. That causes the exception to not be caught [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/compat/glibcxx_sanity.cpp#L54), so we bail.\r\n\r\nAgain, just a complete guess. Fwiw, I just tested a master build on 10.9 and all is good, but that means little in this context.",

If that fixes your problem, we can either stop there, or compare the results to see why your homebrew deps aren't working.\r\n\r\nfrom bitcoin srcroot:\r\n```\r\nmake -C depends\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/x86_64-apple-darwin*\r\nmake\r\n```\r\nThe first step will take quite a while.

      "body" : "@gavinandresen Newer is not always better. OpenSSL 1.0.1 proved that with Heartbleed. Newer code doesn't always fix older issues (Shellshock existing for decades unnoticed).  You should also read up a bit on OSX. Some people cannot upgrade due to 10.8+ being 64 bit only. They shouldn't have to get a new computer to be able to use the default Satoshi client. Many people still use older machines too. I personally have a early netbook running Windows XP with Armory. Dropping support could push away newcomers as well (if the blockchain size doesn't).\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Bad idea to drop support for \"legacy\" operating systems when a lot of people may use them on offline machines and/or may not be able to upgrade their machines.",
