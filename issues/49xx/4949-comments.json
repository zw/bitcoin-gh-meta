I'm working on OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, which looks like will probably need a broader notion of the context in which a script executes, but as this is purely a sane \"default context\" any further needs to modify the default can be handled separately without this causing any issues.\r\n\r\nIt'd help if there was a comment saying, say, what the txid of that hypothetical coinbase transaction actually was. Heck, next time I write up a complex signature-using test I'll put the python script to create it in doc/ somewhere. ",
