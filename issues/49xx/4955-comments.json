This would be valid with an array, as the resulting pointer is only used as end guard and not actually dereferenced. Treating a vector as array is incorrect C++ but not dangerous, as a vector is implemented as array (not guaranteed, but in practice it is for the code that is out there).\r\n\r\nAlso we *all* have to work at our job. This is starting to get old, I'm not sure why you keep repeating it as if it makes you exceptional.\r\n",
