   "body" : "Git is transitioning to use secure 256bit hashes internally and for commit/tag/blob references. Because of the uncertainty with SHA-1, a SHA512 Tree was added to each merge-commit message; and a automatic script was written for maintainers that verifies the tree-hash's integrity.\r\n\r\nThe development community of git maintain a document detailing their progress in addressing original design constraint of hard-coding SHA-1, and migrating to SHA-256:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/hash-function-transition.txt\r\n\r\nIt is not expected that this migration will be completed with great urgency; (unless more serious breakages of SHA-1 are published).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the usage of the tree-sha512 hash within the Bitcoin Git commit history has the advantage of helping detect any software or other problems within git.\r\n\r\nLonger-term goals:\r\nExtract the tree-sha512 algorithms, and create a separate project for it's maintenance and support.\r\nMaybe a seperate project for the Bitcoin Github Merge script: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/github-merge.py\r\n",
