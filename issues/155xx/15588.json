   "body" : "The wallet file version is stored in the \"minversion\" record, not the \"version\" record. However \"version\" is no longer used anywhere except to record the highest versioned client which has opened a wallet file (which is currently only used to check whether this was most recently opened by a 0.4.0 or 0.5.0rc1 client which had a broken wallet encryption implementation). Furthermore, \"version\" was logged to the debug.log which is confusing because it is not the actual wallet file version.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it so that this confusion largely no longer exists. The wallet file version logging is changed to use \"minversion\" and reading and writing the \"version\" record is no longer publicly exposed to prevent potential confusion about whether the actual file version is being read or written. Lastly, in the one place it is actually used, the variable name is changed from nFileVersion to last_client to better reflect what that record actually represents.",
