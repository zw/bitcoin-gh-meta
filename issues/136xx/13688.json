   "body" : "As of #13171 Gitian uses Bionic to build the binaries, but the host machine that runs this doesn't have to be Gitian. The [instructions](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md) currently recommend Debian 9.\r\n\r\nThis machine-inside-a-machine situation is confusing enough, so all things equal I think it would be better to switch the recommended host to Bionic.\r\n\r\nWindows build uses Bionic as well, per #13246. So everyone who does that, could potentially help out with Gitian builds. It would also allow us to reuse the nicely detailed Gitian instructions to help Windows folks out.\r\n\r\nLast time I tried I ran into some trouble though. I'll try again for the v0.16.2 release candidate.",
