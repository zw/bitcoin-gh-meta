Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nSince Bitcoin Core v0.16.1, bitcoin-qt has this problem where minimizing or closing bitcoin-qt makes the window unrestorable, requiring you to exit the program from the system tray menu and restart bitcoin-qt. The only exception to this is by left-clicking the Bitcoin icon in the system tray to alternate between minimize and restore.\r\n\r\nUsing Bitcoin Core v0.16.1 compiled from source.\r\n\r\nOS: Linux Gentoo w/Plasma\r\nCPU: i7-4790k (Haswell Refresh)\r\nDisk type: HDD",
