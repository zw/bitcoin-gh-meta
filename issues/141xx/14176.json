   "body" : "The [documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md) suggest to use debian 8.x, but the script bin/make-base-vm is invoked with '--suite bionicÃ¢ÂÂ that on debian rises an error (not easy to understand for a newby). It is solved detecting automatically the distro and the suite-codename invoking lsb_release.\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building/gitian-building-mac-os-sdk.md) instruct to create the directory Ã¢ÂÂgitian-builder/inputsÃ¢ÂÂ with the MacOSX  SDK inside. The presence of this path does not consent to clone the gitian-builder repos and rises a subsequent error not clearly related to the issue. It is solved checking the presence of the Ã¢ÂÂ.gitÃ¢ÂÂ inside and moving the SDK temporary outside, relocating at his place after cloning.\r\n\r\nThe curl package is required for the build process as described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/README.md).",
