Moreover the test could be made interruptible, in case a new block arrives-- this is also important for BIP23 block proposal testing.\r\n\r\nI do disagree that mining an invalid block is equal to or better than a delay:  A shutdown lets you fall over to another daemon, a shutdown tells you something is broken so you fix it rather than days of fake mining, and a shutdown also prevents you from making blocks that cause false confirmations for SPV clients propagated around broken nodes that broadcast without validating.  -- but the whole question should be moot, since we should be able to perform this check without adding any meaningful delay.\r\n",
