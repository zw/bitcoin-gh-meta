   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\nLots of end users chose some other client than bitcoin core because bitcoin core requires a synch.  The other clients commonly have bugs and security issues.  So new potential users of bitcoin are then left confused and dissatisfied with bitcoin.  This hampers bitcoin adoption rate.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAdd a menu option to enable/disable synch.  When starting bitcoin, if no block data is found on disk, then welcome the user to using bitcoin core, and ask them if they want to enable synch.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.13.2\r\n\r\nThis would surely be easier to implement after SegWit is activated.",
