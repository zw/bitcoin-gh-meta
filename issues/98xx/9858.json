   "body" : "Rational for removal:\r\n\r\n- This is effectively a fatal error to miners regardless, there is no meaningful downside to removing this because getting an invalid template is not practically any worse than getting no template.\r\n\r\n- Due to cs_main locks this causes a large variance in GBT response times and further encourages undesirable workarounds such as validationless mining.\r\n\r\n- Invalid blocks are much more likely to originate from stratum server bugs, something like [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9000) is probably a better way to test block validity.\r\n\r\nI've been running with this TestBlockValidity call removed in production for a few months at this point.",
