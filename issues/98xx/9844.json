   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\nPeople want to backup their wallet at insecure locations.  bitcoin core currently does not encypt public key/transaction history in the wallet.  People have to use an external program such as 7-zip to encrypt the public key data.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nTwo options:\r\n1. Create an extra feature where a password is required to even open the public data part of the wallet.  When this feature is activated, password is required to open the wallet on bitcoin client startup. This could be implemented to also decrypt the private keys of the wallet, so that no further password entry is required to spend.  Another decision would be whether the password should be different or the same to temporarily decrypt the private keys.\r\n2. Add an \"export encrypted wallet\" menu option. User clicks this and a dialog prompts the user for where to save and then a password. \r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nBitcoin core does not currently encrypt public data in the wallet.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.13.2",
