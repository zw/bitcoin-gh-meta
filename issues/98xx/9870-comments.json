      "body" : "Oh, sorry. Greedy as in it greedily picks a big-enough output immediately, instead of trying to clean up your wallet at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf I'm trying to sending X bitcoin, the current algorithm first filters for all unspent outputs that are < X BTC and then tries to use a subset of them to create the transaction.  This has the benefit of when you send bitcoin, you're generally cleaning up the wallet at the same time. \r\n\r\nThis used to be a good idea, but I'm not so sure anymore (at least for a large bitcoin user). For me to get transactions through \"on peak\" was costing ~150 sat/byte, yet I am able to clean up my wallet for <10 sat/byte on the weekend. \r\n\r\nSo the idea of a greedy option is to decouple this. I don't want my wallet cleaned up \"on peak\" and would rather use as few inputs as possible.\r\n\r\nMy example patch just picks the smallest output that satisfies this, which is the behavior I'd want, but you could also do something like pick a random larger output one.",
