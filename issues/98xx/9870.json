   "body" : "Now with bitcoin fees are getting rather pretty painful, it'd be nice to have a `greedy` option for coin selection. This has the obvious implication of bloating the wallets unspent outputs, but that's something that can be resolved in a different way (e.g. sweep the wallet when there's not much fee pressure).\r\n\r\nAdding a greedy option is a surprisingly non-invasive change:\r\nhttps://github.com/RHavar/bitcoin/commit/0f42b19f786eb688afc7790d087c08e4859ccb97\r\n\r\nWith of course the required pluming around it",
