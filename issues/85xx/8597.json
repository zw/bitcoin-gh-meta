   "body" : "Inspired by #8569 \r\n\r\nCurrently it's possible for a node to not send a VERACK and the only impact of this is that the code within VERACK will not be run, which is not desired behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe code behind VERACK ought to be just that - code that needs a verack to run. It may be that a variable be set which would avoid a disconnect after a certain time, for example, but so far this has never been implemented so effectively VERACKs have never been required for a connection to remain connected. The code should perhaps reflect this.",
