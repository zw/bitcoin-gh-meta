I assume (but have not established for a fact) that this is already the case for Core. \r\n\r\n> Ok, I realize all these examples are the same node, ...\r\n\r\nYour logs show ~~four~~ one peer is misbehaving and reconnecting as <peer> 2, 8, 11 and 4. Do you mean that you have only observed these premature ```verack``` messages on the node whose logs you quote above, or only from that IP address?",

      "body" : "@rebroad, ```version``` sets ```pfrom->fSuccessfullyConnected``` and the subsequent ```verack``` sets state ```fCurrentlyConnected = true```, so the implication of *not* sending a ```verack``` ensues from there.\r\n\r\nWhichever way, according to main.cpp, the node in your example gets punished (presumably for the incoming ```verack``` in response to the local node's initiating ```version``` message). The ```verack``` is correctly logged as FAILED since it arrived *before* the obligatory ```version``` message - which arrives but is never verack'd - and an eventual connection timeout should result.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of seeming rude, I have to agree with @sipa that self-study is a basic requirement in this project. All of the above information is apparent from the code. Sometimes it is easy to just ask the general audience in Github, but consider that *everyone* subscribed to this project receives *every* comment via email. If the person asking the question shows that they have not done the required foundation or research reading away from this repository, then rudimentary questions can break concentration, distract, or even be plain annoying. Instead of spraying with a machine gun, we should do homework on our own and then snipe issues and bugs like a self-sufficient sharpshooter. That way no-one has to \"carry\" someone else and the work is autonomous and a contribution.\r\n\r\nThe node in your logs is behaving irregularly. There may be many reasons for that - the primary being that it is running modified code or that it is an alternative implementation that masquerades as a Satoshi client.\r\n\r\nI must mention that in the time since your original comment I have tested outbound connections to a 0.11.1 client without sending ```verack``` and the peer connections persisted beyond timeout, with the remote node seemingly \"forgiving\" the incomplete handshake. 0.12.1 behaves as in your logs and times out a connection that is not verack'd. So your comment is useful despite lacking due diligence on your part.",
