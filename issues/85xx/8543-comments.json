Maybe -setanyonecanpay, with default false?\r\n\r\nWith regard to malicious addition of low-value inputs, with RBF the higher-fee version will overwrite the lower-fee version the attacker is distributing, modulo a minor bit of friction around the anti-network-spam limit. So for full-RBF miners, it's a non-issue, and for most other miners it's a non-issue if opt-in-RBF is set.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for transactions where all inputs are ANYONECANPAY you can sort the inputs by value and drop any input that doesn't make the overall fee-per-kb higher. This is a deterministic process, and would eliminate the issue.",
