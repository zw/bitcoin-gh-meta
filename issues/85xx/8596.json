Change tried numbers from hours to days to make more readable.\r\n\r\nIncrease the frequency of feeler connections to average to 1 minute instead of 2 and move the definition of this variable to net.cpp instead of net.h as it's not used by any other .cpp files.\r\n\r\nAlso, disable requesting of headers to Feeler connections (since we usually disconnect before receiving them anyway), and move the disconnect logic to after the version message has been displayed (otherwise the debug.log often shows the version message after the disconnect message, which could be confusing).",
