Usually it's indeed better to be explicit to prevent bugs due to undefined behavior popping up. And for bitwise arithmetic you should use unsigned types.\r\n\r\nBut this has its limits in practicality, it's not like it's necessary or more readable to add 'U' behind half the values in the program :)\r\n",
