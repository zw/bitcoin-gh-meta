If you'll look at the tags, the last (or one of the last) commits before the release is tagged tends to be a version number bump across multiple files. What's more, by the time this commit makes it into a release, it won't be 0.8.5, it will most likely be 0.9.0, but we don't know yet. Not that it hurts to make this change per se, but it's not necessary.",
