Might be part of the confirmation message box that pops up just before sending the bitcoins.\r\n\r\nWhich would allow what the BIP states: \"If the sum of outputs.amount is zero, the customer will be asked how much to pay\". Using the current implementation on signed payment requests the user is never asked how much to pay, he just gets an error.\r\n\r\nThat makes zero amount payment requests invalid and can not be used for donations, non-address scripts, etc.\r\n",
