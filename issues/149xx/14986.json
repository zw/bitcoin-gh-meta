   "body" : "Hi. \r\n\r\nI have the mainnet blockchain updated (block 554227).\r\nMy app prcesses the whole blockchain and for that I need to read the blocks directly from disk as asking the node for them takes months (to get them and proccess them).\r\n\r\nI run `python linearize-hashes.py linearize.cfg > hashlist.txt` with `max_height=554000` and then I run: `python linearize-data.py linearize.cfg`\r\n\r\nIt only processes block 0 cause in blk00000.dat the 2nd block starts with 0000000000000000 instead of f9beb4d9xxxxxxxx. After reading all blkxxxxxx.dat files linearize-data.py ends without finding block 1.\r\n\r\nThis same thing happened days ago in block around 120000 so I deleted the blockchain and started all over again (wasting almost 3 days).\r\n\r\nWhy does blk00000.dat have a 0000000000000000 after the 1st block?\r\nHow can I know where block 1 is?\r\n\r\nNeedless to say the node is capable of returning block 1 when calling client.getBlockByHash.\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nps: I think that if I could read the index *.ldb files it would be much easyer that linearize-data.py shots in the dark. Where can I find info on the index files?",
