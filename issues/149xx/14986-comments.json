Using -reindex or -reindex-chainstate does not always fix the issue, instead it usually just causes more data corruption issues. I run your script to make bootstrap.dat backup files which I use to reseed my node after it runs into issues. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to write tests yet but I will try to figure it out and add some tests for this script, which I think is invaluable. \r\n\r\n> Is this helper script still useful? If so, a test should probably be added to test it. Otherwise, it might be best to remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@educob I have a similar issue but it occurs at blk00201.dat (about ~57% of the way through at height 575910 on today's date). I get this error:\r\n\r\n`Invalid magic: 00000000`\r\n\r\nI modified the inMagic if statement to continue on if it fails the check but equals '00000000', which has worked so far. Obviously not thrilled about this solution because I don't know why I had to implement it to begin with. Doesn't answer your question about the node randomly writing zeros but know that you are not alone!\r\n\r\n> I have seen that just ignoring the 8 bytes of zeros everything works ok.\r\n> \r\n> So the question is, why does the node, apparently randomly, write 8 bytes with zeros between blocks in blkxxxxx.dat?",
