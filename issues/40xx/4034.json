And by slowing down I mean I was getting time-outs on RPC requests over ssl.\r\n\r\nI noticed the time outs were gone after restarting the wallet once, but gradually came back. Now that I restarted the wallet without the -connect to the unreachable node I have not had a time out since.\r\n\r\n(version 0.9.-something)",
