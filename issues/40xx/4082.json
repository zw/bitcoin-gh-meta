   "body" : "I ran into this writing a regression test for the smart 'estimate fees' code.\n\nCreateTransaction does not deal well with wallets that have lots of small-value inputs and just a couple of high-value inputs.\n\nIn pseudo-code, with default settings CreateTransaction does this:\n\n```\nloop:\n  Select enough inputs to pay (amount+0 fees).\n  Maybe add a change output.\n  Create and sign transaction.\n  IF transaction is small and high priority: DONE.\n  IF enough fees are paid: DONE\n  ELSE:\n     go back to top of loop, re-selecting inputs to pay (amount+fees needed)\n```\n\nThe bug is that if you have a lot of small-value inputs, you get a 'ratchet' effect where (say) 10 inputs are selected, they don't add up to enough to pay fees, so 11 inputs are selected, but adding another input makes the fees even higher so 12 inputs are needed. That continues until SelectCoins either runs out of inputs OR it randomly decides to select a large coin.\n\nThe bug bothering me is when it eventually selects a large coin it will create a very small transaction that pays a much-larger-than-necessary fee-per-kilobyte.\n\nHere is debug.log output from the smartfee CreateTransaction code (instrumented with extra LogPrint statements):\n\n```\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 Estimated fee rate: 0.09375 BTC/kB; size 374, need 3506250 satoshis\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 Estimated fee rate: 0.09375 BTC/kB; size 962, need 9018750 satoshis\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 Estimated fee rate: 0.09375 BTC/kB; size 1700, need 15937500 satoshis\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 Estimated fee rate: 0.09375 BTC/kB; size 2586, need 24243750 satoshis\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 Estimated fee rate: 0.09375 BTC/kB; size 3615, need 33890625 satoshis\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 Estimated fee rate: 0.09375 BTC/kB; size 4942, need 46331250 satoshis\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 Estimated fee rate: 0.09375 BTC/kB; size 6568, need 61575000 satoshis\n2014-04-22 16:59:56 CommitTransaction:\nCTransaction(hash=10c367c2c1, ver=1, vin.size=1, vout.size=2, nLockTime=0)\n    CTxIn(COutPoint(036acfae76, 1), scriptSig=304402207b0c1bdadc92c9b7)\n    CTxOut(nValue=2.48612500, scriptPubKey=OP_DUP OP_HASH160 c808df63821d)\n    CTxOut(nValue=0.01000000, scriptPubKey=OP_DUP OP_HASH160 05fe160591a6)\n```\n\nSo CreateTransaction ends up creating a ~250-byte transaction that pays as much as a 6,500 byte transaction: about 25 times as much as necessary (and that had me pulling my hair out, trying to figure out why my regression test sanity-check code was randomly failing).\n\nWe don't see this as much in our existing code, because the wallet code rounds up transaction sizes to the next 1,000-byte multiple. That is really just hiding the problem, though.\n\nI'm still thinking about how to test and fix this.\n",
