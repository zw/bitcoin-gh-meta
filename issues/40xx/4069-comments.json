Padding out the .sst to 32MB would maintain compatibility with current parsers while escaping the virus scanners. \r\n\r\nThe files not being executable isn't actually anything to do with it, malware authors get around this on Windows by creating file links that attempt to execute any file. This was used on Reddit recently, with a \".txt\" file containing a \"leaked Bitstamp passwords\" and a link to it containing a command that executed the \".txt\" file. It's a fairly unpleasant trick that gets even seasoned users, so I'm not sure a global whitelist of those files would be advisable. Even apparently safe files can be dangerous on Windows.\r\n\r\nIn reality virus scanners are the dumbest of the dumb. Even just XORing the files would do. There's no comfortable way of doing it though, either every platform obfuscates the blocks with the next version at the expense of massive IO for the whole network, or Windows users have incompatible block files with Linux and OSX. In my opinion just padding out the sst files is the least destructive change. ",

      "body" : "Please think about what a virus is: Executable code. There are only 3 ways in which data in a file can be executable on any operating system:\r\n- The file contains a program header. Notice that the file extension is *not* a program header. The header is contained *inside* of the file. On Windows its typically a PE-Header (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable). The trick for executing .TXT files likely only works if they contain such a header. [But then it is not even an exploit, if I recall it correctly you are for example free to use the regular Windows CreateProcess() API to execute files without EXE extension.]. So as our SST files do not contain a program header, this case does not match.\r\n- The file does not contain a program header but the operating system still executes its content automatically due to exploitable bugs. This has been used in viruses for sure. But it is again not our problem, the bug in the OS is to blame and to be fixed.\r\n- The file does not contain a program header but there is a different file, commonly called a \"loader\", on the computer which does contain a program header, thereby gets executed, and contains code to load the non-executable SST file into its own address space and execute it. This is the only case which in theory could match here. But there is no reason for a loader-program on a computer to randomly pick up our SST files and load the very particular area which contains the virus for execution. This would have to be done intentionally, you don't just execute random file content. So the loader is the malicious root of execution. And as long as the virus scanner detects and deletes the loader, the non-executable SST file is completely harmless. There is no reason for the virus scanner to care about the non-executable file. So even in this only matching case, there still would be a large indication that the virus scanner is just wrong here, it is a false positive.\r\n\r\nConclusion: You are wasting your time discussing this. Contact Symantec to fix the *false* positive. They are obliged to do so: After all a virus scanner divides the world into \"good\" and \"bad\" software, which is a really judgmental thing to do, and someone who is that judgmental has a moral obligation to only judge against something which is *really* malicious, which Bitcoin isn't in any way. It is their job to fix this.",

In any case, I don't think there's any jurisdiction with strict liability for possessing data copied illegally - most don't even consider it a crime unless there was a profit - so that's a bit off-topic for this issue. Bitcoin nodes never store/distribute data other than financial transactions anyway. To claim transactions generated deterministically from illegal data carry over the colour is already a pretty big stretch and probably wouldn't hold up in a court. The problem is that often automated tools are used to detect viruses and strict-liability-for-possession-data which can produce false positives. XORing the data should stop the false positives.",

And it is possible for someone that knows the compression algorithm to aim for a certain compressed data pattern. Note that the LevelDB files aren't that large. Bulk of the store data are the block chain files themselves.\r\n\r\nAs for compressing the block chain, the 15-20% that can be gained in some cases is not going to make the difference for anyone in being able to run a full node or not. And (de)compression overhead is not trivial unlike XORing.\r\n",

So after the AV software breaks a file because it thought it was bad (which it may have been), the user can get that file again.  This means adding a halt-and-repair-file function to the bitcoin client.  The function would request the path to the bad file, request a new version from peers, and then use some blockchain data to validate the new file.  It could then compare the new file with the old to tell the user whether the AV was a false positive (no difference) or the file had actually been altered.\r\n\r\nI haven't (yet) thought about this long enough to see what problems it might cause, but I can't see any off the top of my head.",

I was under the mistaken impression that what my client was doing (right now, because I got that silly.218 problem) was retrieving the blockchain again.  Actually, it's just re-indexing, but it is taking a few hours.  If there were a protocol to get a chainstate file from someone else, then that would take a couple minutes, and then the client could do the same thing it does at every startup (validate all the data).  That would take a few minutes instead of a few hours.  If --rescan would accomplish that, then why wasn't it mentioned before?  Laanwj suggested the --reindex was the best way to fix it once the .sst file was deleted.",
