How much thats worth I dunno.  I don't have that much of an opinion: The existing code is brain damanged, either it should check more than one or the loop should be removed.  I don't have that much of an opinion which we do, which is why I was asking what people thought before I went into benchmarking it on wallets with lots of keys.\r\n",
