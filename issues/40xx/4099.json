If I try to `decoderawtransaction` I'm told:\n\n```\nbash: bitcoind: Argument list too long\n```\n\nIt appears (http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6060?page=0,1) that the Linux kernel limits command lines to 128kB by default, and that's the limit I'm running up against here.\n\nIt would be useful if there was some way of decoding a transaction giving just the transaction ID, so I don't have to copy the huge hex string output and feed it back in as input.\n\nMaybe `decodetransaction` would be a good name for it, and it would basically just `getrawtransaction` and then `decoderawtransaction`.\n\nAll I really need is the `scriptPubKey` of a particular output of the transaction, and so would be happy with an RPC call that just grabs that, taking a txid and vout as arguments, but that's probably overly specific.\n\nAlternatively, if bitcoin-cli had an option to read its parameters from stdin, that would work too, and allow arbitrarily large amounts of input.\n",
