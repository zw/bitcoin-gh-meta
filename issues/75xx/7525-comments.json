Yes, downloading 65GB for you or me is easy, but is almost IMPOSSIBLE for someone in Africa, Rural America, etc.\n\nWhatever you feel about the current cost of **storage** is irrelevant.  Again, this is a **usability** problem that makes it harder for layman to approach.\n\n@sipa @cloudnthings   You two are suggesting that customers/investors/layman/public take FURTHER steps, do MORE work to find other options.  Every single step further that a person has to take, is more unlikelihood that they will adopt it.  The more difficult it is to use, the more research/time/effort it takes to use safely, the worse adoption will be.\n\nWhy on earth would you make it harder for people to use your product?  \n- Most people do NOT need a full node.\n- Random people running nodes without the deep knowledge of when to upgrade them can be damaging.\n- Layman approaching bitcoin, when they find the \"source\", should NOT be confronted with \"the only original option is to run a full node.\"\n",

      "body" : "Yes. I'm still working on this. Though, there are some challenges (more conceptual) and hight risks of creating work that will end up in the bin.\n\nIMO:\n1. Core's wallet should run on it's own process and communication only over p2p (at the beginning, maybe also over RPC).\n2. The wallet should use SPV against the fullnode on localhost and/or SPV against a trusted fullnode on a remote system\n3. The GUI should be split into \"node GUI\" and \"wallet GUI\" (maybe to separated applications, or at least two separated code bases [one could be a submodule/subtree of the other]).\n\n**Point 1** can be realized by adding a runtime- (or even compile) option that allows running the bitcoind in SPV mode (only headers will be loaded, no mempool), most node code is unused in this mode.\nBut: the question the might be raised, if having a wallet-only mode (SPV) in bitcoin-core is something we really want to have (or if it should be writing in a new independent repository).\n\n**Point 2** is challenging. I guess using p2p and RPC at the same time will be hard to configure for a \"non-experienced\" users if the node is running on a remote server. Also privacy is a problem.\nIMO the best way would be, to add optional encryption to the p2p layer by ECDH and preshared pub keys (auth) and allow to server some special commands to allowed nodes (your local SPV wallet). Fee estimation and things like that would be required to run a detached, process separated wallet. Also, if we fully would like to decouple the GUI form the node, we could think about commands to control your node over p2p (although, this includes some serious conceptual security risks). Configuring a SSH tunnel for p2p and RPC seems after a really bad user experience (setup hassle) and would probably not allow to use smartphone SPV wallets against your trusted fill node. If we would allow p2p auth & encryption, this would result in a very easy setup (pre-share a ec pubkey between fullnode and spv-node, done).\n\nOne of the main problem is, touching the bitcoin-cores wallet can introduce new bugs in the wallet code which could result in loosing funds (worst case). Also main bottleneck for wallet changes and reviews.\n",

What you are saying is to a adapt Bitcoin-Qt so that it becomes essentially a thin-client wallet and runs against a (not necessarily local) bitcoind which it trusts. I think full nodes ought to have signatures so that thin-clients can recognize the nodes they trust with something other than IP addresses to enable this.  It may be that there are already other wallets which can be set to trust full-nodes - can anyone here comment on which wallets already do this? (And do they use anything other than IP address to ensure they are talking to a trusted full-node?)\n",

If that is the conclusion, perhaps I can redeem the idea by starting to identify node-specific code and shifting it into a similar  `nodeServiceModules` object?

In fact you can't because they can't run at the same time unless from different VMs.\n\nAlso, the reason I don't run a bitcoin client on my laptop is because 60 GB is too much, maybe for some people buying a bigger drive is not a problem but for some of us, we don't have the same financial resources available so we don't replace hardware until it fails.\n\nIt would be great if I could use the blockchain on my desktop from my laptop - with the Qt client - specifying the IP address.\n\nThin clients may be beyond the scope of bitcoin-core now but it doesn't have to be.\n\nEspecially now that many ISPs are implementing bandwidth caps, it makes sense to have bitcoind running on one computer on a LAN that all clients on the LAN can communicate with. Sure you can configure all the other clients to only use the one on the LAN as a source for blocks, and some people do that, but is that any more secure than just having thin clients connect to the one on the LAN?\n",
