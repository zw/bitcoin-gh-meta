This has caused many complications and bugs in the past, especially during initialization, only now it seems to have cooled down a bit so I'm not really happy to stir the ants' nest again (we don't have a test suite for this part).\r\n\r\nRemember this all has to be backwards compatible. We can't just drop QSettings support. If you remember 0.5.x, the client used to store GUI settings in the wallet. It took long enough until we were able to finally drop that functionality.\r\n\r\nI'm happy that you're adding options to the GUI, but please don't couple it to this.\r\n",
