For example invalidateblock.py seems different from reindex.py (the former is \"dynamic\", a real life situation during a reorg, while the latter is \"static\" and not something that's often used) so it'd be nice to have the option in applicable tests.\r\n\r\nI had wiped the cache (temp) dir and retried several times.
