This is more of a bug fix then a new feature. \r\n\r\nMoved fAllFromMe and fAllToMe creation blocks up to the top. This changed the indentation of the below if blocks, breaking most of the diffs though the original code stayed the same. Added new vars anyFromMe and anyToMe. Added new condition for (anyFromMe && anyToMe && !fAllFromMe && !fAllToMe). Added type CoinJoin label.",
