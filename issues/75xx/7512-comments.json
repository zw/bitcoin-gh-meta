It was reported to github and discussed in the #bitcoin-dev logs a while back. It looks like github fixed the one set and not the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n19:29 < gmaxwell> looks like github may be compromised or badly broken: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master?author=saracen\r\n19:34 < midnightmagic> i thought that was an artifact of the conversion process\r\n19:37 < phantomcircuit> gmaxwell, it's always been like that\r\n19:37 < phantomcircuit> (i had the same thought to once)\r\n19:38 < midnightmagic> it's consistent with my (extensive) experience with scm->scm conversion tools that were badly-written\r\n19:39 < gmaxwell> hard to see how thats possible, since that account is much newer than the commits in question.\r\n19:39 < phantomcircuit> gmaxwell, timestamps on commits are not verified by github\r\n19:39 < CodeShark> the commits don't have to have the right time\r\n19:39 < CodeShark> you can set your clock back a decade and commit\r\n19:40 < gmaxwell> thats not my point. I mean it couldn't have _always_ been that way because that account didn't exist always. :)\r\n19:40 < midnightmagic> argh does github order by date or by git log order..?\r\n19:40 < CodeShark> by date - it sucks\r\n19:43 < midnightmagic> whoah!!\r\n19:43 < gmaxwell> yea, okay. I reproduced the stupidity.\r\n19:45 < gmaxwell> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master?author=gmaxwell&page=6  < see bottom\r\n19:46 < gmaxwell> first commit in bitcoin core repo is now from me.\r\n20:13 < Luke-Jr> [02:37:19] <phantomcircuit> gmaxwell, it's always been like that <-- +1\r\n20:14 < gmaxwell> Thats not actually true.\r\n20:14 < gmaxwell> Unless you think it was also always like this: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master?page=264\r\n20:14 < Luke-Jr> I don't remember a time where the contributors page didn't bug that way\r\n20:15 < Luke-Jr> gmaxwell: it was, but with a different user\r\n20:15 < Luke-Jr> (disclaimer: I did not view that exact page before)\r\n20:16 < gmaxwell> perhaps we should change the merge script to refuse to merge commits that don't have dots in their email addresses.\r\n20:16 < Luke-Jr> do we have any recent like that?  \r\n20:16 < gmaxwell> Luke-Jr: it was messed up like that from whatever moment saracen added sirius-m@1a98c847-1fd6-4fd8-948a-caf3550aa51b to their email list.\r\n20:16 < gmaxwell> Thus my latest example, I just went and reproduced using sirius-m@1a98c847-1fd6-4fd8-948a-caf3550aa51b\r\n20:17 < Luke-Jr> gmaxwell: sure, but that was a long time ago\r\n20:17 < gmaxwell> oops I ment s_nakamoto@1a98c847-1fd6-4fd8-948a-caf3550aa51b in the penultimate case.\r\n20:18 < Luke-Jr> I noticed it at least as early as when we were contacting devs to sign that joint letter  \r\n20:18 < gmaxwell> in any case, I went and reserved all the other dotless names in the history. .. looks like it only lets a single github user claim them, first come first serve.\r\n\r\nObviously it doesn't change the content of git itself, just what the text on the website shows.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can get github to fix the other ones and make them non-usurp-able like they did the first one I reported.\r\n\r\nCheers.",
