This means that every single new user that comes along is inadvertently running a FULL NODE.  While having more nodes can be useful, you wind up with users that just \"leave it alone\" and not keep up to date.\n\n**Reaction**\nWhen a user is nervous and learning about a new system it can scare, intimidate, and ward them off to be confronted with a full node download (currently 60GB), especially when all they expected was a \"wallet\"\n\n**Solution**\nI suggest separating the products, because they ARE distinct.\n- bitcoin-node\n- bitcoin-wallet   (thin by default, ALLOW to connect to your own defined node)\n\nWhile 3rd party wallets / thin clients DO exist, I feel we need a rock solid place for users to start.\nYes, people should do their research, but we need to make it as easy as possible to approach and use.\n\nWe want to make this as stupidly easy as possible for any member of the public to approach.\n\nThoughts?\n",
