   "body" : "Hi everybody.\r\n\r\nI searched for duplicates for this issue but I couldn't manage to find any, both on this repo and on Google. It happens with Bitcoin Core v0.11.2 on Windows (current environment : Windows 10 x64) and seems to happen randomly some time during sync start, never immediately. The problem is a total crash of the program. I can relaunch it to keep syncing but it slows it down quite a lot - I can't leave it on overnight. I'll get throught it but I found it interesting to share this report with you.\r\n\r\n**What I do**\r\nI launch Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n**What does happen**\r\nIt resumes syncing to get the full blockchain, nothing bad happens at this moment. Then, several hours later, a seemingly random error throws in : an error windows appears, describing a fatal error that will lead to program shutdown. Closing this windows terminates the program.\r\n\r\n**What happens then**\r\nI can restart the program, it will resume syncing. Then you can go back to \"What does happen\" because the same error happens again after a few hours.\r\n\r\n**Context data**\r\nThis happens on Windows 10 x64. The program (v0.11.2 - x64) was downloaded from bitcoin.org.\r\nThis doesn't seem to be a network-related issue, it happens on very different network contexts.\r\n\r\n**Relevant log**\r\n```\r\n2015-12-22 18:58:41 IO error: Win32WritableFile.Sync::FlushFileBuffers C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\chainstate\\223994.ldb: MÃÂ©dia protÃÂ©gÃÂ© en ÃÂ©criture.
