I am running a pool which represents 70% of the coin's  network hashrate (altcoin of course), I can find few sequential blocks then this miner will mine the next block and orphan all of my previous blocks!\r\n\r\nLooked into:\r\n\r\n- My blocks are broadcasted/propagated fine (checked that) until the said miner broadcast his blocks.\r\n- Tried changing IPs (thought my node was banned ?!), Changed daemon versions but nothing.\r\n- Made a separate network that gets connected to the mainnet once every few hours, and this also didn't help !!! \r\n\r\nHow the heck did this miner achieve this and what can I do about it ?",
