   "body" : "When calling `CombineSignatures` and `VerifyScript` inside signrawtransaction with a `CMutableTransaction`, the tx is converted into a `CTransaction` which requires hashing.\r\nBecause both `CombineSignatures` and `VerifyScript` accept the `scriptSig` created by `SignSignature` separately from the transaction we can instead convert the mutable tx to `CTransaction` once and use that one.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n1000 inputs, 75kB before signing: 2.86s vs. 4.88s\r\nSignature concatenation of three 250kB transactions with 1000 inputs: 8.638s vs. 19.142s\r\n\r\nThere still remains some unnecessary hashing, but fixing this requires a larger refactor: `SignSignature` requires a `CMutableTransaction` because it changes the scriptSig in place. But it also immediately creates a `CTransaction` (costly) for a `TransactionSignatureChecker`. Using a `MutableTransactionSignatureChecker` is not an option because it immediately converts the mutable transaction to a `CTransaction`. Instead, the `TransactionSignatureChecker` should be able to deal with `CMutableTransaction` without rehashing.\r\n",
