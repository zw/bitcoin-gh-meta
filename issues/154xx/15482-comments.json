      "body" : "Given the issues with the mailing list, and the lack of a PR adding the BIP, I'm going to write some thoughts I have regarding the general idea of the proposal here. My apologies if this seems like the wrong forum.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit surprised that the possibility of using forward blocks to achieve future scaling is not mentioned in the BIP or PR, since the absolute removal of the time-warp attack vector closes off the possibility of using the bug for forward- and backwards-compatible soft-fork scaling in the future, as I covered in [my talk at Scaling Bitcoin](https://scalingbitcoin.org/transcript/tokyo2018/forward-blocks) last year.\r\n\r\nWhile developing the idea of forward blocks I sent a vulnerability report email to some of the senior Bitcoin Core developers. In it I outlayed some analysis of the attack vectors, and a suggested solution which both prevents the sort of attacks which could be devastating to the network, while still allowing uses of the time-warp \"feature\" to achieve on-chain scaling when it becomes necessary at some point in the future. I'll quote that part of the email here:\r\n\r\n> ...It turns out this is to the advantage of bitcoin users as the time warp is an integral part of how we can make a block size increase and/or PoW change without a hard fork, and thereby allow such proposals be decided on their own merits rather than as a yea or nay decision on hard forks generally.\r\n>\r\n> ...This is an issue that has been known about for some time and persists as unfixed because, as I understand it, the likelihood of attack was low and likelihood of coordinated user response high.  And since ideas like Forward Blocks require the time-warp bug to achieve forwards-compatible scaling of settlement capacity, I would think it short sighted to advocate for \"fixing\" the bug now.\r\n>\r\n> However in discussing forward blocks with another developer, I happened upon a solution that would allow for the worst scenarios to be avoided while not blocking off the later deployment of forward blocks: If the current block timestamp is more than 4 hours beyond the median time of the past 11 blocks, then the difficulty adjustment errors if the adjustment would exceed a smaller limiting factor than the normal +/- 4x.  Specifically I recommend ensuring that the block timestamp is within the range [start + 600\\*2015 - 4800, start + 600\\*2015 + 4800]. 4800 = 80 * 60 = 1 hour 20 minutes.  This would allow decreases in the inter-block time of no more than 12.6% the first year of purposeful adjustments, and is easy to implement.\r\n>\r\n> (Potentially the lower limit could be removed as it would be nice for the difficulty to be able to quickly reset, but asymmetric adjustments have been a source of error in the past.)\r\n>\r\n> This would prevent ... [censored bug disclosure] ... while still allowing a rate of growth for forward blocks or other proposals to that is conservative slow enough as to not cause catastrophic failure. Requiring the block timestamp to be 4 hours ahead of the median time past ensures this rule is very unlikely to be engaged during normal operation of a healthy network, for which normal [unconstrained] difficulty adjustments can still occur.\r\n\r\nThis approach additionally has the advantage of being *less* disruptive than what is implemented in this PR. No rule changes are engaged at all until such time as the adjustment block's timestamp is 4 hours ahead of median time past, so there is no risk to un-upgraded miners outside of a time-warp regime because a block more than 2 hours in the future is considered invalid. I *think* this modified rule would make it safe to switch to BIP8 instead of BIP9 for deployment.",
