So imo another reason to remove the \"feature\"\r\n\r\nI think there's a difference between *encouraging* users to change behaviour and pulling a feature out from under them. We really don't have a good picture of how users use our code, so I'd always err on the side of caution when deprecating features.\r\n\r\nI'm going to modify my mild concept ACK with a merge-NACK-until-this-has-been-more-widely-discussed. We're probably fine, but it seems to me that any P2P change that was added to Bitcoin Core with a BIP should be removed after public discussion.\r\n\r\nHere's how I expect it'll go: someone will post a mail to the bitcoin-core mailing list saying \"I propose to remove REJECT messages in Bitcoin Core v0.19\", no-one will respond, and then we'll remove them. I'm happy to send that post if you'd prefer not to.",

As of **v0.13.0**, this is only available for `NODE_BLOOM` (BIP 111) peers.\n * [`BIP 37`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki): The bloom filtering for transaction relaying, partial Merkle trees for blocks, and the protocol version bump to 70001 (enabling low-bandwidth SPV clients) has been implemented since **v0.8.0** ([PR #1795](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1795)). Disabled by default since **v0.19.0**, can be enabled by the `-peerbloomfilters` option.\n * [`BIP 42`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki): The bug that would have caused the subsidy schedule to resume after block 13440000 was fixed in **v0.9.2** ([PR #3842](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3842)).\n-* [`BIP 61`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0061.mediawiki): The 'reject' protocol message (and the protocol version bump to 70002) was added in **v0.9.0** ([PR #3185](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3185)). Starting **v0.17.0**, whether to send reject messages can be configured with the `-enablebip61` option, and support is deprecated as of **v0.18.0**.",
