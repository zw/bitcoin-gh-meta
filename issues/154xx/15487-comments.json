Current state as of df794753284cc1bd991a5cdf0bd747fffb1db3b9 seems to be that a descriptor wallet is a blank wallet that you're allowed to import public key descriptors to, without them being used for anything yet.\r\n\r\nIt does seem to me that the flag stuff might be overkill. I don't think we need a new flag or changes to createwallet now that we already have blank wallets. It looks like `WALLET_FLAG_DESCRIPTOR_WALLET` just creates a lot of new branches all over the code that don't need to exist or could be replaced with `!m_descriptors.empty()`.",
