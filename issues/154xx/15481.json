   "body" : "This prepares us for a potential future timewarp-fixing softfork by\r\nensuring that we always refuse to mine blocks which refuse to\r\nexploit timewarp, no matter the behavior of other miners. Note that\r\nwe allow timestamp to go backwards by 600 seconds on the\r\ndifficulty-adjustment blocks to avoid bricking any existing\r\nhardware which relies on the ability to roll nTime by up to 600\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible that the eventual softfork to fix timewarp\r\nhas a looser resetriction than the 600 seconds enforced here,\r\nhowever it seems unlikely we will apply a tighter one, and its fine\r\nif we restrict things further on the mining end than in consensus.",
