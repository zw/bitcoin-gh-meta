It is true that if someone had an ambiguous config file, and they updated to a new bitcoin version and then restarted without testing, they would see a \"Multiple values specified for -foo in same section of config file\" init error. But there wouldn't be a question of correctness, or risk that the new version would start up using different settings than the old version.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think a debug log warning would be as good as an error here, given experience with issues like #15629 where warnings have seemed pretty easy to miss. I understand your concern about the case where someone upgrades their version of bitcoin and sees an error about an insignificant ambiguity in their config file. But I wouldn't want to forget about cases where someone could upgrade bitcoin be prompted to fix config errors that actually affected their privacy or security.\r\n\r\nI wonder what you think about Jeremy's suggestion to prevent errors in more spurious cases where a setting is repeated but the value doesn't change: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17493#pullrequestreview-318636254. It'd be pretty easy to tweak the PR to avoid triggering errors in these cases.",
