   "body" : "Hello, as [BIP 179](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0179.mediawiki) is now a Draft, I think it is time to implement it in Bitcoin Core. For people who don't know what this BIP does, in short it re defines the term \"address\" to \"(Bitcoin) Invoice (Address)\", where \"Bitcoin and \"Address\" are optional. The reason for this is to avoid that addresses are treated as something permanent.\r\n\r\nMy current implementation plan would be to change the strings in bitcoin-qt and add them as other terms for the RPC commands (so the older ones still work). I don't plan to modify class names and file names by this because it would be probably a too big change.\r\n\r\nI want to mostly rely on \"Invoice Address\" to not make it to complicated for users (in bitcoin-qt)\r\n\r\nFeedback appreciated, anything I forgot?",
