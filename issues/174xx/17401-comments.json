      "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've started working on this. Not sure if I understood the goals correctly (*and if I should write anything here*), but I can at least generate a static lib based on src/test/util sources. I've also removed the many src/util/test headers from *Makefile.test.include*, because I don't need them anymore to compile individual tests. \r\nInstead, I've put into each test's LDADD the libtest_util.a, that is *$(LIBTEST_UTIL)*.  However, I'm not quite sure if this is the correct way to do it.\r\n\r\nThere's also a new [Makefile.test_util.include](https://github.com/brakmic/bitcoin/blob/test-util-lib/src/Makefile.test_util.include). \r\n\r\nNot sure if another Makefile would be allowed, but before I expand the already existing (and complex) ones, I think a small, separate Makefile is better.\r\n\r\nHere the link to the commit in my forked repo: https://github.com/brakmic/bitcoin/commit/3f4b5e3a0b93c6b528bf707fd38eb63c0e29efa9\r\n\r\nI'm working on macOS Catalina 10.15.1 with clang 9.0.0. \r\n\r\nRegards,",
