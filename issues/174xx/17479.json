   "body" : "Net processing now passes a `BlockValidationState` object into `ProcessNewBlock()`. If `CheckBlock()` or `AcceptBlock()` fails, then PNB returns to net processing without calling the (asynchronous) `BlockChecked` Validation Interface method. net processing can use the invalid `BlockValidationState` returned to punish peers.\r\n\r\n`CheckBlock()` and `AcceptBlock()` represent the DoS checks on a block (ie PoW and malleability). Net processing wants to know about those failed checks immediately and shouldn't have to wait on a callback for. Other validation interface clients don't care about net processing submitting bogus malleated blocks to validation, so they don't need to be notified of `BlockChecked`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if PNB returns a valid `BlockValidationState`, we never need to try to process (non-malleated) copies of the block from other peers. That makes it much easier to move the best chain activation logic to a background thread in future work.",
