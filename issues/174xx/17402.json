   "body" : "Apparently travis has powerpc64 support even though it's undocumented.\r\n \r\nI found a couple of caveats though:\r\n1. Compact glibc support doesn't work (should be solved in #14066 )\r\n2. it fails building OpneSSL from `depends` (@fanquake tried debugging and it looks like it can't recognize the platform).\r\n3. Docker doesn't recognize the platform correctly, so I had to use `ppc64le/ubuntu:18.04` instead of `library/ubuntu:18.04` (this is also maintained by Docker themselves https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64)\r\n4. functional tests are timing out.",
