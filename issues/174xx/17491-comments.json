It is also unnecessary: Bitcoin works perfectly fine over tor without creating _any_ HS or accepting incoming connections-- and this is generally the most private way to use it.\r\n\r\nBitcoin also does not do a particularly complete job of preventing a given host from being tracked across different identities-- e.g. the content of your addrman database will usually uniquely identify you (particularly if an attacker does some work to tag your state), similarly the mempool can be abused in this manner too using slow to confirm transactions.  The swapping from one identity to another would also create a temporal signal (X stops, Y starts at the same time) which could be used to trace the user.\r\n\r\nHaving short lived pseudonymous identities is with some respect the worse of all worlds-- not getting additional inbound connectivity, not providing a useful service to the network,  wasting rumour/connect resources, and still leaking information that could be used by an attacker to continually stay connected to a particular target.\r\n\r\nFor different protocols where inbound connections are important the considerations might be entirely different.\r\n\r\nEdit:  After some reflection I guessed that maybe people are trying to imitate the new-identity button in torbrowser.

It frequently contains confused or wrong information for substantial spans of time.  (it also frequently has good stuff... but \"the wiki says something\" isn't by itself much of a case).\r\n\r\n>  I am not sure but if there are ways or possible in future to associate transactions with onion service then using the same address for long is bad practice.\r\n\r\nThat would be a serious vulnerability in its own right.  If someone is concerned about that the best move is to not have a HS on that node at all.  If we're just speculating about some hypothetical vulnerability that might somehow be discovered, not running a HS is the only clear solution.  Otherwise any particular rotation schedule might be insufficient.\r\n\r\nAlso, it sounds like the text you are quoting is concerned with identifying material on your own machine... however there is absurdly identifying material all over a bitcoin install-- in the logs, in the ancillary data created by the databases, in the shell histories of cli users, etc. \r\n\r\n> It makes your own node more robust against Sybil attacks and network partitions.\r\n\r\nUnlikely: Connecting _out_ to HS likely does, but your nodes HS address is unrelated to making out-bound connections. Inbound connections are potentially entirely attacker controlled.\r\n\r\nBut I think my question there wasn't clear. I am not criticising the use of HS, but pointing out that if someone is operating in some super security paranoid mode then the correct move is to not listen at all on the node they are trying to protect, because any listening lets attackers actively connect into them.  Frequently changing HS addresses is the worst of all worlds-- attackers can still connect but because the address often changing it won't add much (if any) connectivity to the network and even wastes peers time/bandwidth with useless old addresses (this could potentially be reduced by adding a expiration time to addr records-- but that seems like a lot of work for a behaviour without much clear utility).\r\n\r\nAside, pages like  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Setting_up_a_Tor_hidden_service are extremely outdated and wrong.  No configuration is needed to setup a hidden service now beyond having a tor install with a working control port, and using that is covered in tor.md.  The reason it doesn't go into more detail is because those details are all automated and not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
