Having balances updated multiple times a second is by design, but could I think could easily improved by only repeating computation when contents of mapWallet changes. (I'd like to see this because the polling causes a ridculous amount of spam in #10102 IPC logs.)\r\n\r\nThe trace showing lots of calls to LookupBlockIndex is suprising to me because generally balances are cached, so I'm not sure why they aren't being cached in this case. It could be interesting to look into. Also #15931 will prevent the repeated LookupBlockIndex calls regardless of other things.",
