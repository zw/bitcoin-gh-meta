There's possibly a [third case](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16837#discussion_r322842701), but I haven't looked into that enough yet.\r\n\r\nPatching `0` -> `kCGMouseButtonLeft` should not be required, as [`kCGMouseButtonLeft`](https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/plugins/platforms/cocoa/qcocoacursor.mm?h=5.9#n82) has been used in the `cocoa/qcocoacursor.mm` source for a while.\r\n\r\nThe include we were modifying in [`src/plugins/platforms/xcb/qxcbxsettings.cpp`](https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/plugins/platforms/xcb/qxcbxsettings.cpp?h=5.9#n47) was removed in [this commit](https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/commit/src/plugins/platforms/xcb/qxcbxsettings.cpp?h=5.9&id=78731b434e0e99ad108601249108e12d8a49c350).",
