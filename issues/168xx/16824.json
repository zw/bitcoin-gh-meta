   "body" : "On a crash, bitcoin-qt may dump a core file that contains what was in memory at the time of the crash, for debugging purposes.  The problem here is that bitcoin-qt stores the user's wallet.dat unencrypted in memory.  With this information it becomes rather trivial to reconstruct parts of a user's wallet.dat from a .core dump alone.  You can find the wallets within the core file simply by grepping for known parts of a wallet.dat ex: `xxd bitcoin-qt.core | grep \"6231 0500\"`  With this information you can find the offset of the wallet within the core file, and reconstruct it per a known wallet.dat's length.  Upon reloading the extracted wallet into bitcoin-qt, you'll lose address book information - but balance is retained.  **This has been assigned CVE-2019-15947**.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/oxagast/50a121b2df32186e0c48411859d5861b\r\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15947\r\n",
