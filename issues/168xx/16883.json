This is work-in-progress meant to gauge interest, related to but not dependent on [#16110](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16110), i.e. one can run the \"mobile\" GUI on desktop as well. You should install `qtdeclarative5-dev` and `qtquickcontrols2-5-dev` in addition to usual Qt dependencies and configure with `--enable-mobile-gui`.\r\n\r\nAs a proof-of-concept this PR aims to be light, about 400 lines of C++ code that is meant to be a drop-in replacement for `bitcoingui` with mostly the same public functions and a couple of #ifdefs in `bitcoin.cpp`. There is also an addition of `roleNames` to the `transactiontablemodel` to make it compatible with QML stuff.\r\n\r\nReplacement class `bitcoinmobilegui` hooks up to the exact same signals, models and controllers as `bitcoingui`. At the moment the mobile GUI presented to the user is dead simple (no multi-wallet, no advanced options) but it has been tested to allow the user to send and receive.\r\n\r\nMy rationale for making this is the fact that in a couple years phones will be powerful enough to run Core without much hassle. If we add some platform code for \r\n\r\n- verifying transactions only while in foreground or charging (to preserve battery)\r\n- enabling phone to phone transactions (NFC or bluetooth for enhanced privacy)\r\n- providing services to other local apps (think Lightning wallets, they could get the blockchain state from Core, no wasting of resources)\r\n\r\nand release an official Android package I believe that this has the potential to put a full node in the pockets of millions - empowering users and improving the network.",
