   "body" : "Hello, my bitcoin node (v0.16.99.0-e057589) crashes without throwing an error while syncing indexd. It happens after a few hours (it seems to be happening faster every time) and is really frustrating. I'm using the latest release in this server: [https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/indexd-server]()\r\nIt happens on both ubuntu and centos 7 on different systems so it doesn't seem hardware related.\r\n\r\nbitcoin.conf\r\n```\r\nlisten=1\r\nrpcuser=xxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\nrpcpassword=xxxxxxxxxxxx\r\nrpcport=8332\r\nrpcconnect=127.0.0.1\r\nrpcallowip=222.22.22.22\r\nrpcallowip=127.0.0.1\r\nrpcallowip=22.222.222.22\r\nzmqpubhashtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:38832\r\nzmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:38832\r\nserver=1\r\ntxindex=1\r\naddrindex=1\r\nwalletbroadcast=0\r\ndaemon=1\r\nrpcthreads=16\r\nrpcworkqueue=32\r\n```\r\nI've tried setting the rpcworkqueue and rpcthreads lower but it didn't help a bit. \r\nI've also played with the RPCCONCURRENT setting in the indexd server, setting it to 32 or 16 wont didn't help.\r\n\r\nThe debug.log, don't think there is anything interesting there.\r\n[https://pastebin.com/T830Qg8k](https://pastebin.com/T830Qg8k)\r\n\r\nAny alternative rest api's that I can use to get utxo's from an address are welcome, Its frustrating that I don't have many options here, I prefer to use a core node.",
