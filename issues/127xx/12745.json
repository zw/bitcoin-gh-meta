   "body" : "-help-debug is used to hide \"debugging options\", and many of them are of\r\nno use to the average user or node operator.\r\n\r\nIn contraast, fee settings are relevant to possibly emergent fee selection\r\nbehavior such as the lowering of minimum fees. Exposing these settings\r\nin the help output increases their visibility and thus the possibility that\r\nnode operators will voluntarily reduce their fee requirements. Seems that\r\nwould be a fine thing, akin to volunteering computation and bandwidth.\r\n\r\nPrompted by 874e8180858450e7cc597e8ed9b047c35e000dda",
