This change drops the NONE enum and uses a simple bool to indicate parse failure, and a new CHANGE_AUTO enum to refer the change output type.\r\n\r\nThis change is almost a pure refactoring except it makes RPCs reject empty string (\"\") address types instead of treating them like they were unset. This simplifies the parsing code a little bit and could prevent RPC usage mistakes. It's noted in the release notes.\r\n\r\nFollows up #12408 by @MarcoFalke",
