      "body" : "Of course on testnet there is no fee market and nobody (including miners) cares about the fees. I only reported an observation that appeared on testnet (likely by chance) that can be repeated on mainnet if some miners don't  mine immediately some fraction of the transactions paying enough to be mined on the open market. I'm pretty sure it can be made profitable even with a not very large fraction of the hashrate involved in this scheme as long as non-neglibible fraction of the transactions blindly follows the Core fee estimate. The cost of this scheme is the opportunity cost of skipping well-paying transactions and the profit is the increase of the average fee rate after the increase in the estimates. It can be even done stealthily by not mining e.g. segwit transactions once in a while at all. The  observers would rather think it is a result of misconfiguration or using a different Bitcoin implementation than a malicious move. \r\n\r\nThe reason it may work is that estmatesmartfee has a very strict 95% criterion so by delaying confirmations of only just a bit above 5% of the transactions, miners can influence the estimate.  \r\n\r\nIt is hard (if not impossible) to estimate fees but the algorithm should at least be not gameable in miners favor. \r\n\r\nIn a somewhat related observation, 0.16.0 estimatesmartfee currently shows higher fees for 3 confirmations than for 2 on testnet:\r\n\r\nbitcoin-cli -testnet estimatesmartfee 2\r\n{\r\n  \"feerate\": 0.00728060,\r\n  \"blocks\": 2\r\n}\r\nbitcoin-cli -testnet estimatesmartfee 3\r\n{\r\n  \"feerate\": 0.01010419,\r\n  \"blocks\": 3\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
