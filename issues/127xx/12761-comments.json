It makes the RPC code actually understandable (how else are you supposed to know what `request.params[3]` means?) and makes it less likely that documentation will become out of date when the code changes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I could be missing something, but  all of the suggestions above seem more complicated than the current help implementation, not simpler. I'd expect it would simplify tooling to structure the documentation, so it wouldn't be necessary to parse the big strings, instead of just moving the strings from one file to another.",

I can see your point.\r\n\r\nThe idea was just to make automated RPC documentation, such as the one on my [experimental website](https://bitcoin-rpc.github.io/), easier/trivial.\r\n\r\nBut I also understand that it would make the doc quickly obsolete, as most other online documentations are for example. And since I don't have an idea how to do this in an easy and readable way, I am probably closing this",
