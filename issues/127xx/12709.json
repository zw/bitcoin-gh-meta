Further PRs could add optional args to over-ride that behavior.\r\n\r\nAlternative ideas would be to sort the outputs by some deterministic ordering. (this would require more refactoring since change outputs are created and handled by caller)\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12699",
