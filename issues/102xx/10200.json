   "body" : "After compact blocks (BIP 152), including recently received transactions in a block may lead to propagation delays relative to blocks without such transactions, because recently received transactions may not yet be in peers' mempools.\r\n\r\nAccount for this in `CreateNewBlock()` by adding two new parameters:\r\n\r\n * `-recenttxwindow` defines a \"recent transaction\" as having been received less than this many milliseconds ago\r\n * `-recenttxstalerate` models the additional likelihood of a block being stale because it includes a recent transaction.\r\n\r\nBriefly, if `I_0` is the block income you'd receive using only non-recent transactions, and `I_1` is the income including recently received transactions, and `s` is the value being used for `-recenttxstalerate`, then `CreateNewBlock` is now going to choose the block that doesn't include recent transactions if `I_0 >= (1-s) * I_1`.\r\n\r\nNotes for reviewers:\r\n- I struggled to name and explain these two parameters, so suggestions on alternate/less confusing parameter names and explanation would be appreciated!  @ryanofsky suggested `-recenttxblockdiscount` or `-recenttxminingpenalty` to try to describe what I called the stale rate; I think those are reasonable suggestions as well.\r\n - Suggestions are also welcome for what the defaults should be (in particular, should this be enabled at all by default?)\r\n- In my most recent performance measurements of a slightly earlier version of this patch, I measured an approximately 3ms slowdown (~ 7ms -> ~ 10ms) in the transaction selection portion of `CreateNewBlock()`.  I suspect we can optimize `CreateNewBlock` further, but I'd like to save that for a future PR as this is already a lengthy patch.\r\n- The idea in this PR is to produce two block candidates, one with recent transactions and one without, and then compare block income and pick a winner.  The candidate which does not include recent transactions is not going to be as good in general as the regular ancestor-feerate-mining algorithm being called on a mempool that doesn't contain any recent transactions, because for performance reasons we might continue to include low-fee ancestors of recent transactions (ie, we kick out recent transactions from the block, but not their ancestors).  Despite this, I think for most reasonable parameters we will be overwhelmingly choosing the block that doesn't include recent transactions, so I don't think this is a big deal at the moment.  We could try to improve this in the future, however (possibly by adding a smart caching layer on top).\r\n- This PR includes a (slow) functional test for the mining code, which I've added to the extended test suite.\r\n\r\nThanks @JeremyRubin and @ryanofsky for feedback on an earlier version of this patch.",
