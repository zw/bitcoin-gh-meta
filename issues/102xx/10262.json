   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\n\r\nIf External IP changes, server sometimes loses incoming connections until daemon is restarted.\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n\r\nYes, although it can take several attempts.\r\n\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n\r\n1. On the router configure port forwarding to 8333 (TCP & UDP)\r\n2. On the server, run `bitcoind -listen=1 -server=1 -upnp=1 -debug=net -onlynet=ipv4 -blocksonly = 1` and let it establish incoming connections.\r\n3. Then disable PPPoE, wait 10 mins, enable it again (to obtain a new IP address) and wait for it to again receive incoming connections. \r\n\r\nSometimes I need to try 2-3 times and wait 10-15 minutes until I re-enable pppoe. I'm not sure if it's simply a matter of trying several times or the length of disconnection has to be over X minutes. \r\nAnd in my case I always get a new IP address, so I'm not sure if that is what messes it up or simply the fact that it went offline for a while.  \r\n\r\n### Expected vs. Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nExpected: router continues forwarding incoming 8333 to $lan-ip:8333 and bitcoind server continues accepting incoming connections.\r\n\r\nActual: `AdvertiseLocal` changes to the new IP and `ProcessMessages` also shows the new external IP address, but incoming connections to bitcoind never recover.  Only outgoing connections to the network recover.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n\r\n* `\"/Satoshi:0.14.1/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)/\"` (` v0.14.1.0-g1809845`)\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\n\r\nWith Port Forwarding set up, uPnP shouldn't be required. I first tried Port Forwarding alone and noticed no difference. \r\nI first built using \"default\" (from build-unix.md) instructions and then one more time with libupnp explicitly enabled in `--configure` and bitcoin.conf and was able to reproduce this independently of uPnP.\r\nExternal port-check to $router-ip:8333 confirms the port is open after router (pppoe) restart.\r\n\r\nErrors I get after external connections start failing: \r\n\r\n```\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 sending headers (82 bytes) peer=22\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 received: inv (217 bytes) peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 got inv: tx 8c7eb2218f2440aa729c43ab7ec01a0b4a21967b5cdf6c024989fb2cb73128f3  new peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 transaction (8c7eb2218f2440aa729c43ab7ec01a0b4a21967b5cdf6c024989fb2cb73128f3) inv sent in violation of protocol peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 got inv: tx c45cd995af1eb3f3e93827d50ce20b497f097ceb11c17786cd279012ada6099b  new peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 transaction (c45cd995af1eb3f3e93827d50ce20b497f097ceb11c17786cd279012ada6099b) inv sent in violation of protocol peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 got inv: tx 55d0122ba1e9ff679ea0faccb03dee635bab4b82f0de10dc642f23ab42b31757  new peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 transaction (55d0122ba1e9ff679ea0faccb03dee635bab4b82f0de10dc642f23ab42b31757) inv sent in violation of protocol peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 got inv: tx 5cc62dd856948bbb208fbf621d2a40b0c7cb290a47589947d7f1a378adac08f3  new peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 transaction (5cc62dd856948bbb208fbf621d2a40b0c7cb290a47589947d7f1a378adac08f3) inv sent in violation of protocol peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 got inv: tx a0b8c68dfdc0f46be908da01a130c6b7c5fc558eaabf8345c395091e1954ed0c  new peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 transaction (a0b8c68dfdc0f46be908da01a130c6b7c5fc558eaabf8345c395091e1954ed0c) inv sent in violation of protocol peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 got inv: tx f350743826f242945bd471f584238d95b9b702bb5c2d51e3a152b5e64da92144  new peer=23\r\n2017-04-23 08:29:21 transaction (f350743826f242945bd471f584238d95b9b702bb5c2d51e3a152b5e64da92144) inv sent in violation of protocol peer=23\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more detailed log which shows two pppoe restarts (the second attempt was successful) can be found here (free pastebin, so it's going to remain for 30 days):\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/TiYpEnJe",
