Generally it is not expected that you will receive inbound connections very fast because address rumoring is deliberately slow through the network. Your comment seems to indicate that bitnodes is agressively announcing your address for you in their network crawling, which will result in more nodes knowing about your new address and, probabilistically, more nodes connecting to you (especially spy nodes and random nodes set to use bitnodes as a seed address database). It may be that address rumoring could be made a bit faster, but nodes that just came online aren't so useful anyway as they aren't as likely to remain online as some others.",

In general I see why address rumoring should be non-instant, but my node is up-to-date block height-wise so the network would benefit more if it was used earlier rather than later compared to nodes that are 50,000 blocks behind. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how long it takes to recover on average (as I've never observed it for more than 2 1/2 days). If we have 500 server nodes that change IP on a daily basis and take 2 day to recover, about 1,000 servers could be constantly MIA. My server sometimes gets a new IP every day, so without Bitnodes I could be running it 24x7x365 and never receive any incoming connections. That doesn't seem right. \r\nA wait of 1-2 hours without incoming connections would seem reasonable to me but 12+ hours or even several days means that any server that gets a new IP daily is mostly unused.\r\n\r\nShould I test how long it takes to recover without the help of Bitnodes?

      "body" : "> I agree that they aren't as likely to remain online, but it may be a good idea to have a formula that doesn't penalize up-to-date nodes\n\nIt's not about nodes being deliberately penalized, but simply a question of how long it takes for other nodes on the network to hear about your new address. Sadly there are other considerations beyond \"how quick can we make rumoring\". In the last few releases some bugs were fixed which made address relay gameable (ie allowing nodes to be more aggressive with broadcasting their own address to get other nodes to connect to them more), which is likely a big part of what you're seeing here.\n\nWhen you upgraded to 0.13.1/0.14.X, the preferential peering kicked in and more of your peers are other 0.13.1/0.14 nodes, which may rumor a bit slower. It's possible there is a bug here and someone should go do another more careful reading of addrman, but it's also pretty explainable just from reasonable code changes.\n\nOn April 27, 2017 11:28:53 PM EDT, unsystemizer <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>I agree that they aren't as likely to remain online, but it may be a\n>good idea to have a formula that doesn't penalize up-to-date nodes.

Deleting the peers.dat shouldn't have any (significant effect). Alternatively, you could go through and disconnect all of your existing peers without restarting (or just wait a bit longer for it to re-advertise its new IP). Ultimately, you're just always caught in a race to have your new IP be known around the network to legitimate peers before your IP changes again (I used to host shit on a residential DTAG connection, I know the pain...), which I actually believe you likely do not get even by restarting - many of the \"fast to connect\" peers are likely to be spy nodes that aren't useful anyway.",
