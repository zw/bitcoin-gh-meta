An additional flag could be added to the mempool just for the node to start to force the miners of the content that will go into the garbage block.\r\n\r\nOnce a day, the garbage block would be the supreme block that the network would need to agree on. The nodes would have 30 minutes to come up with a HASH of the list of transactions that need to be in that block.\r\n\r\nThis would be a condition where multiple miners could literally find the answer to the block, but nothing move until the Garbage Block consensus is over. The intensive here is not to be the fastest but to clean up the garbage. The intensive would be for the miners to have it done has fast as possible to resume normal operations. (This block could have or not a coinbase.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't know where to send this idea, so I am throwing it into the sea.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTheo Chino\r\narticle78againstNYDFS.com",
