There are libbitcoin functions and global variables accessed all over Qt code right now. With this change, all of these calls (there are around 200 of them) are stripped out of Qt code and moved into a one file: [src/ipc/local/interfaces.cpp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-local/src/ipc/local/interfaces.cpp).",

      "body" : "> What would be the downsides of using the exiting layers (clientmodel / walletmodel) better?\r\n\r\nIf you look at the `ClientModel` class, you can see it is doing a lot more work than the `ipc::local::Node` class is. Similarly with `WalletModel` and `ipc::local::Wallet.` The ipc classes are just simple shims around low-level node and wallet functionality, while Qt objects implement higher level logic specific to our current GUI. I think `ClientModel` and `WalletModel` classes are still useful after this change. They will just have 1 job instead of 2. Instead of serving as both abstraction layers and MVC model classes, they will serve only as MVC model classes.\r\n\r\nAlso, and in more concrete terms, the reason these interfaces live outside the src/qt directory is that with #10102, they need to be accessed not only by `bitcoin-qt` but also by `bitcoind` (specifically inside the `StartServer` function in [src/ipc/server.cpp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/ipc/server.cpp) which is called here: https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/ab0afba3a44255b3eec80f4eebe45a851ae23927#diff-6e30027c2045842fe842430d98d099fb",

If UI blocked before, it will still block after these changes, if UI didn't block before, it won't start blocking now because of these changes. If remote calls are too slow because of socket/serialization overhead, we can process UI events in the background while they are being made. There are many ways to accomplish this, with one possible way described in that comment above. If anything, having calls get funnelled through an IPC framework makes it easier, not harder to add more asynchronicity.",

      "body" : "> Using QT slots/signals for all(most?) communication would be required anyways and would be beneficial even without IPC and therefor should be done first.\r\n\r\nThis was my point too. Making the GUI asynchronous would avoid ever hard-freezing the GUI. Modern operating systems assume that an application has crashed if its GUI thread is unresponsive. This is a priority for improving user experience. For example: Currently, if e.g. a transaction is sent while the cs_main lock is held the entire thing hangs for a moment. Ideally it would display a modal dialog with a status, or progress animation instead. There are similar issues at startup.\r\n\r\nSure, this is only partially related to IPC work: When the GUI already would communicate with Qt signals and slots with the core backend (similar to how RPCConsole and RPCThread communicate, for example), it could be mostly oblivious whether this backend exists in-process or communicates over a pipe.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's laudable that you're working on this, it looks to me that what you are doing currently is simply replicating what we do now but replacing direct core calls with IPC calls. The drawback is that it calcifies some things that shouldn't have been designed that way in the first place (e.g. into multiple abstraction layers), making it harder to improve later.\r\n",

In the next PR they are created and run in the `bitcoind` process instead of `bitcoin-qt`. That's the reason these classes do not reside in the `src/qt` directory and one reason why they don't really substitute for the `WalletModel`/`ClientModel` classes. See my previous comment for details and a code pointer: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244#issuecomment-295887270. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do see that it is kind of silly to have cases where Qt code calls a `WalletModel`/`ClientModel` method that merely forwards to a `WalletImpl`/`NodeImpl` method. I can easily clear this up by inlining these `WalletModel`/`ClientModel` methods, which would make the classes more lean.\r\n\r\nAlso, if this PR will be too difficult to review because of its size (https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/84348447/), I can easily decompose it into smaller PRs that could be gradually merged. It is already broken up into separate commits, and many of the individual commits could be further broken up (right now they try to group together related changes).",

Should they be turned into logic on the core signed, abstracted by the new interfaces, or just inlined into the calls sites inside the GUI?\r\n\r\nI think if model code is just calling interface functions it should probably be inlined. But if model code is doing something useful to support the gui, like caching, it should be kept. If there is model code that makes too many assumptions about node/wallet internals, or implements functionality that could be useful for RPCs, I think it should be moved into the core and wrapped by new interfaces.\r\n\r\nExample of code that could be inlined:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9cdbd195ba85b1af12fe8c55db3880df73e107ff/src/qt/walletmodel.cpp#L354-L366\r\n\r\nExample of code that should be kept:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9cdbd195ba85b1af12fe8c55db3880df73e107ff/src/qt/clientmodel.cpp#L73-L86\r\n\r\nAn example of code that should be probably be moved into the core is a lot of the startup and config code in [qt/bitcoin.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9cdbd195ba85b1af12fe8c55db3880df73e107ff/src/qt/bitcoin.cpp).",

If you disabled the same `#ifdef` on master while still including `wallet/wallet.h` you would see the error. The error is just saying that the code can't be linked because it is taking the address of a function (`SplashScreen::ConnectWallet`) that isn't defined.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test the runtime error in this method, you could try disabling the same `#ifdef` and passing a null function pointer in.\r\n\r\nNote that I would like to get rid of the checks for the `ENABLE_WALLET` macro both in this function and its caller. But the refactoring required to do this would make this PR bigger and require changes to both gui code and wallet code instead of just gui code, so I've opted towards a compromise for now that avoids any uses `ENABLE_WALLET` in the `Node` interface definition, but does fall back to them in a few places in the implementation.",

Would that be useful to document in the interface header? Or should that be obvious?\r\n\r\nI definitely think it's useful to document when functions may throw specific exceptions (or when they are guaranteed not to throw). I'm not sure how useful it is just to document the fact that functions can throw exceptions. I think this is just a basic assumption in c++ when you haven't disabled exceptions at compile time. Anyway, I'm happy to add a comment if you have a suggestion for one.",
