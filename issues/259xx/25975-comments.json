This means that the logs in stdout/stderr will flow to `journald` as expected on `systemd` systems.\r\n\r\nSidenote: There's currently no way I can find to tell `systemd`: My spawned process will append logs to `/var/lib/bitcoind/debug.log` so have `journald` watch that file for logs.\r\n\r\nSidenote 2: While it doesn't make sense to modify `-daemonwait` such that the child process inherits the parent's stdout/stderr (those invoking `-daemonwait` on the CLI expect the process to be fully detached), it might make sense to add a `-daemonwaitinherit` or something like that, but I think that might be an unwanted bloat of the CLI interface and that `-startupnotify` is good enough here.",
