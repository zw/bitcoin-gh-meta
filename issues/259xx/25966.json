The test was originally added [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4566ab75f277612425337bf7786c1d3a410d894a) however there was never an assertion about the coins that should be selected, only that a solution is found (which is a redundant solution to the test [above](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L222)).  The comment was later added here to [fix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/384273260a6ccbcf79dade0830011f528e5a1581) it, however it's unclear what exactly it's testing.  A test was later added [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L366) where if the [long term fee](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L357) is less than the current [fee](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L356), then select fewer UTXOs, which may have been the original intent.",
