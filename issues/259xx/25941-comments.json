Any of the paths this is hardcoding could change. Any of the directories this is recursively deleting could contain files that are needed in the future. It's easy to think of ways the build could break in the future by making this change. It's difficult to think of ways this change could ever prevent some breakage.\r\n\r\nWhich approach is \"clearer\" is subjective, but an approach that has simpler builder recipes and fewer build steps and fewer hardcoded install paths seems clearer to me.\r\n\r\nI guess I don't think the PR in its current form is an improvement, but I don't think the cost is very high, and wouldn't want disagreement over this to hold up other work.",
