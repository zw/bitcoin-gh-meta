But as it is in a lambda, itself hidden in a template, it was hard to see at the location indicated (which is just the 1st line of the lambda missing some valid return).\r\n\r\nSo the final `assert(false);` is insufficient, it should at least be an exception that can be caught, or some valid string such as \"\" (depending on the expected semantics).\r\n",
