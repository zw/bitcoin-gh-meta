I believe this makes the code misleading.\r\nThis PR enables the clang-tidy check 'readability-static-accessed-through-instance'. \r\n> Checks for member expressions that access static members through instances, and replaces them with uses of the appropriate qualified-id.\r\n\r\nhttps://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/readability/static-accessed-through-instance.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI used the `-fix` option of clang-tidy to discover and fix these issues.",
