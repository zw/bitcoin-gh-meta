If you do the latter, `listwalletdir` and the Open Wallet GUI need a trivial change.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 reasons. The first is that it's easier on review on implementation to stick to one filename. As you mentioned, if I make it `.sqlite`, `listwalletdir` and other places need to be changed. There are several places throughout the codebase where we specifically look for `wallet.dat` and not changing those to also use `wallet.sqlite` could be very bad. Additionally, some of those places may need to know whether they are looking for `wallet.dat` or `wallet.sqlite` so they would need access to whether a wallet is a descriptor wallet. They may need to know what kind of storage to look for which exposes more information than we currently already do. It's much simpler to just keep it `wallet.dat`. This avoids issues where the wrong filename could be used and makes review simpler.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that there are already lots of tooling, documentation, and discussion that use `wallet.dat`. Things like backup scripts or instructions telling people how to backup their wallet won't be invalidated as we keep the same naming. For the most part, the end user doesn't care about how the data is being stored within the file, they just need to know to preserve the `wallet.dat` file. So by keeping the naming, all of these things stay the same and make it less likely for people to lose their money.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a few cases where tooling does need to be updated because of the format change. But this tooling is all for manual inspection of the wallet.dat file and most users aren't using that tooling.\r\n\r\n> Would it make sense to switch some of the records over to a format that's more easy to inspect with a SQLite viewer? As well as use tables like \"transactions\"? Or would that make this PR far too complicated?\r\n\r\nI would like to do that in the future. But I think that is too complicated for right now.",

Sometimes we do need to handle concurrency withing `SQLiteDatabase` but those should already be handled by `m_refcount` and sqlite itself.\r\n\r\n> nit: I believe it's better to have all members private. Why not make `SQLiteBatch` a friend class or just pass the statement handlers when we construct `SQLiteBatch` object.\r\n\r\nI suppose now we could pass them in. In a previous revision, I don't think that was possible.\r\n\r\nBut it's easier to just let them be public members. It would be 6 extra arguments to pass them in and we are already giving the `SQLiteDatabase` container.",

Sometimes we do need to handle concurrency withing SQLiteDatabase but those should already be handled by m_refcount and sqlite itself.\r\n\r\nCould you please elaborate on this part? It looks like there are indeed places when we access `WalletDatabase` instance from another thread without acquiring lock first. For example `CWallet::chainStateFlushed`. From my understanding of sqlite it's safe to use by multiple threads, but they should be using different connections. Which is not the case in this example. And I'm not sure how `m_refcount` will help with that.\r\n\r\nI guess in BDB this was handled by `cs_db` within `BerkeleyDatabase::Open`",

The `wallet/sqlite.cpp` numbers are low because of many lines dedicated to error checking but also `HasKey()` and `TxnAbort()` are not covered while they are covered on the BDB class. I suppose the reason for that is that these functions are not covered by wallet tests but other tests where a BDB based wallet is used. We currently only run the wallet tests with a descriptor wallet AFAICT. Should this be changed now? Maybe there are already plans for this were I missed the discussion.",

That would be the only case when this seems valuable because otherwise the `runtime_error` would be hit in case there is a problem and the error message would be clearer I think? Yes, this could be a bug in SQLite but in general, we are trusting that the ret/res codes are not lying so I don't know why we would do it differently here.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, the `runtime_error` will currently only be hit if `ret != SQLITE_OK` but the `ErrorLogCallback` is not being called. Again, I couldn't find details/guarantees on this in the docs but at least they say the callback will be used ['whenever anomalies occur'](https://www.sqlite.org/errlog.html), so my expectation is that it would always be called as whenever `ret != SQLITE_OK` is true. So I think the `runtime_error` may never be hit unless there is a bug in SQLite.\r\n\r\nOverall it just feels strange to do anything but logging in a function that is called `*LogCallback`.",

      "body" : "> I think this change should be merged with more tests enabled. Particularly wallet_backup.py and wallet_multiwallet.py tests would be good to have running, but probably others would be good as well. Doing this is pretty straightforward after #20034, and I took a shot at in a branch: [master...ryanofsky:pr/sql](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...ryanofsky:pr/sql) ([branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/sql))\r\n\r\nI think #18788 is needed to enable those tests.\r\n\r\n> I think this change should start off on the right foot using sqlite naming and locking conventions. We don't disguise sqlite journal or WAL log files as BDB log files, and I don't think there's a reason to disguise the new data file with the old name. Using \"wallet.sqlite\" clearly identifies file format and wallet directory type to provide transparency and help debugging, and should avoid tools that aren't equipped to access these files from trying to access them\r\n\r\nI have two main arguments to retain the `wallet.dat` naming:\r\n\r\n1. Existing external backup tooling, documentation, and other information refer to the wallet file as wallet.dat. In the vast majority of those cases, the exact file format is irrelevant so they will still be applicable to a sqlite wallet.dat. In the cases where the file format matters (only pywallet AFAIK), the file format is checked so the tool will error if it isn't correct.\r\n2. If the user has specified a sqlite wallet in their conf file, downgrading may result in a new bdb wallet.dat file being created in that directory. This can be confusing the user (they \"lost\" all of their money) and potentially issues with a subsequent upgrade to a version with sqlite (there would be both wallet.dat and wallet.sqlite in the same dir). I think it would be better to explicitly error (and a sqlite wallet.dat would cause an error for old software) rather than fail silently.",

The only thing that might prevent bugs in practice is the fact that most of the database is copied into memory and not actually accessed through database lookups, and the fact that the cs_wallet mutex makes most wallet operations single threaded in practice. But these things only make the code accidentally correct instead of correct by design. The sqlite implementation shouldn't have object sharing and reference counting code that makes it more complicated than it needs to be, and less safe than the bdb implementation (or any sane key/value API). You shouldn't get undefined results, for example, simply reading two keys from two different threads.",

How do you know whether or not something is logged to the error log? Does every function call that doesn't return SQLITE_OK log to the error log? If so, then I guess there's no technical reason to handle errors twice even if code looks like it is silently discarding them.

It is then left open to avoid constantly closing and reopening it.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like my suggestion was not clear. My suggestion is to open the database when the database object is created, and close it when it is destroyed. This opens and closes the database *fewer* times than the current implementation (due to not having to open close and reopen for verification) and is *simpler* (also due to not having to open close and reopen for verification). Feel free to ignore the suggestion or to follow it up later, but I hope I am getting it across clearly.",

Just setting the pragma doesn't get the lock, you have to do an empty transaction to acquire it. This just means you need 3 statements to open the database: `pragma locking_mode=exclusive; begin exclusive transaction; commit;` instead of 1 statement.\r\n\r\nUsing the sqlite exclusive lock would be more reliable than .walletlock and simpler because it would be a part of database opening, not in some other code path separate from opening, and because it would no longer requiring extra code removing .walletlock at shutdown (this code already had a bug previously in this PR).\r\n\r\nIn case it helps, I found it pretty straightforward to test locking from the command line:\r\n\r\n- Terminal 1\r\n  ```bash\r\n  $ sqlite3 db.sqlite\r\n  sqlite> pragma locking_mode=exclusive;\r\n  exclusive\r\n  sqlite> begin exclusive transaction;\r\n  sqlite> commit;\r\n  sqlite> \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Terminal 2\r\n  ```bash\r\n  $ sqlite3 db.sqlite\r\n  sqlite> pragma locking_mode=exclusive;\r\n  exclusive\r\n  sqlite> begin exclusive transaction;\r\n  Error: database is locked\r\n  sqlite> \r\n  ```",

I think `SQLiteDatabase::Open` should ignore the mode argument just like `SQLiteDatabase::Rewrite` ignores the skip argument. It would simplify the implementation here in various ways. And later I think the mode argument should be dropped from BDB as well in favor of simply respecting the `DatabaseOptions.require_existing` value passed when creating the database object.",

However on that failure, a salvage will be attempted. This will do nothing because the file magic does not match BDB's. The file remains unchanged when this occurs and it fails with the error message `Error: wallet.dat corrupt, salvage failed`.\r\n* Downgrading with the sqlite wallet named `wallet.sqlite`\r\n  * When attempting to load via `loadwallet`, the wallet will not be loaded as the RPC checks for existence of the `wallet.dat` file in the wallet's directory. It fails with the error message `Directory does not contain a wallet.dat file.`\r\n  * When specified with `-wallet` (either in cli options or bitcoin.conf), **a new `wallet.dat` file will be created and used.** This is a wholly new wallet unrelated to the `wallet.sqlite` file. There are no errors. This is dangerous.\r\n\r\nFor that last case, we either must keep the `wallet.dat` name, or come up with some workaround that prevents previous versions from creating a wallet.dat file.\r\n\r\nThe only possible solution I can think of is to create a dummy `wallet.dat` file to prevent previous versions from making a new file. However this is potentially dangerous because users may are expecting a `wallet.dat` file and may have tooling to interact with the `wallet.dat` file (such as creating and restoring backups) and thus they may be accidentally interacting with a useless dummy file instead of the real `wallet.sqlite` file. So I don't think this is a good approach.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as mentioned previously, there is a lot of tooling and documentation involving the name `wallet.dat`. Users are expecting their wallet file to be named `wallet.dat`. While we have a `backupwallet` RPC and backup option in the GUI, many users probably don't use these because there is \"common knowledge\" of directly backing up the wallet.dat file. And while copying the `wallet.dat` file while Bitcoin Core is running is not a supported use case, copying it after a clean shutdown is. Users may be doing that for their backups. Retaining the `wallet.dat` naming means that those tools and documentation are still valid.",

It seems unlikely external tools or documentation would be able to cope correctly with data in a new format (I would be curious to see counterexamples). I would actually expect things written to deal with BDB files to handle SQLite data badly or even dangerously. If there is external documentation referencing `wallet.dat` files, and people are reading it expecting do something with sqlite descriptor wallets, I think it is _good_ not _bad_ they won't be able to find `wallet.dat` files, so they can know what they are reading is probably out of date and inapplicable.\r\n\r\nMost documentation that I have seen only discuss creating and restoring backups. In both cases, the file format does not matter. Scripts involved in both also wouldn't care about the file format itself, just the filename. For example, a cronjob that copies a `wallet.dat` file to another location is something that I would expect someone to do, and that is completely agnostic to the data format. Furthermore, for restoring wallets, as we have no equivalent of the `backupwallet` RPC, users have to copy their wallet file back into the datadir, and everything regarding restoring will instruct users to copy the file back as `wallet.dat`. These operations are all unrelated to the format of the `wallet.dat` file, but do require the file to be named `wallet.dat`.\r\n\r\nIn terms of actual tools that operate on the `wallet.dat` file, I don't think many exist. The only ones I know of are pywallet and btcrecover. In both cases, they use BDB's python bindings which will check the file magic before opening the file. In fact, I would expect that any tooling that attempts to modify the `wallet.dat` file to be using the BDB library which will check the file magic before opening the file. It doesn't make sense to me to try to interact with the `wallet.dat` file without a library because that would interfere with the BDB system. So I don't think that should really be a concern for us.\r\n\r\n> But your case is much more obscure, because in #11687, the new wallets could actually be created directly from the static configuration, while in your case it requires active RPC or GUI interactions to create the incompatible new wallets. And your case also requires the user to load the wallet in a different way than they created it, instead of the same way they created it (GUI interaction, or load RPC or load through settings.json).\r\n\r\nI don't think this case is really more obscure. Creating a wallet and then adding it to the configuration to always load it does not seem like an unusual case. Especially if people want to use a new feature, but then also always load the same wallet when they start the software.",
