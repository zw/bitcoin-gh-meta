This does assume that you're not making these ZMQ connections to a bunch of other external-party system environments where per socket config could be useful. I think this assumption is valid though because I perceive the ZMQ stuff to be for data distribution within one's own (internal) environment. Third parties would be running their own nodes and distributing data from those nodes within their own envs. Make sense?",

I think the reason why is because the libzmq code does not call `setsockopt` with `SO_KEEPALIVE` due to [an old commit in the libzmq repo for Windows](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/797/files). I think that commit should have set the `SIO_KEEPALIVE_VALS` in addition to, not instead of, calling `setsockopt`. I verified that the keep alive packets are not sent when the Windows node has ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE by `tcpdump`ing on a Linux system that was connected to the Windows node as a ZMQ subscriber.\r\n\r\nThese changes are still good for Linux systems. These notes just document how Windows is not affected by this PR because of a bug in the ZMQ library.\r\n\r\nAdditonally, I verified that setting ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE on the subscriber side does work to keep the connections alive and working. Doing that is an alternative to this PR (which sets ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE on the publisher side). The goal is to keep packets going through whatever intermediary has the idle timeout that silently drops the connection. Therefore, the keep alive can be set on either side of the TCP connection to be effective.\r\n\r\nHelpful related links:\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/so-keepalive\r\n- https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/blob/2cb1240db64ce1ea299e00474c646a2453a8435b/src/tcp.cpp#L112-L137\r\n- https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/blob/2cb1240db64ce1ea299e00474c646a2453a8435b/builds/gyp/platform.hpp#L45-L74 (look for ZMQ_HAVE_SO_KEEPALIVE)\r\n- https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/enabling-tcpip-keepalive-windows\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTesting note: the following commands were useful to setup the subscriber side Linux system so that it's firewall would silently drop the connection after 30 seconds of being idle (when ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE was not set [or having the desired effect]).\r\n\r\n```\r\n# set the keep alive packets to go out every second if the sockets are configured to use keep alive\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=1\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=1\r\n# setup iptables to drop non-loopback packets that are not in conntrack as being established\r\nsudo /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\r\nsudo /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\r\nsudo /sbin/iptables -P INPUT DROP\r\n# make conntrack forget idle TCP connections after 30 seconds of inactivity\r\n# be sure to run the next command AFTER configuring conntrack in iptables, otherwise the files may not already exist under /proc/sys.\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established=30\r\n```\r\n",
