This can be convenient once it's decided to enable BIP34 from the height=1 in regtest. And it seems there is an intention of doing this as `create_coinbase(height, pubkey=None)` accepts the height and its value is correctly incremented in tests. Otherwise, we would need to pre-mine 16 blocks with BIP34 off in all functional tests. It looks like a weird workaround that can be avoided.\r\n\r\nHowever, I see it's a minor change, and there are ways to work around it if needed. Let me know if there is anything I can help here.",
