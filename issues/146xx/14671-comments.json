Especially in case they have the `bitcoind` running for other reasons already.\r\n\r\nIf someone really cares about performance, they can write the util functions in their native language or use a library. I am not sure if our repo is the right place for a high performance library, but providing such a library seems partly orthogonal to providing the utility functions on a JSON RPC server.",
