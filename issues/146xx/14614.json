I assume this brings a result that it miss a tx which is supposed to be matched if it meets the following conditions.\r\n\r\n- a block contains descendant transactions using existing filter's outpoint\r\n- child tx comes before its parent\r\n\r\nIf the filter has `BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL` or `BLOOM_UPDATE_P2PUBKEY_ONLY`, It also fails BloomFilter auto updating.\r\n\r\nI think it should re-order txs in a block to be canonical transaction order before the process of merkle block filter match\r\n",
