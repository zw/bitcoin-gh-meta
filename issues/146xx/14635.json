   "body" : "This PR changes developer notes to suggest naming instance methods with `lowerCamelCase()`, and other functions with `UpperCamelCase()`.\r\n\r\nLower camel case names were allowed by the developer guide before #10917, and are used in a good amount of [existing code](https://gist.github.com/ryanofsky/8718089b2927912f77db0d7cb1728350).\r\n\r\nUsing lower camel case to distinguish instance method calls from other types of calls can aid with code readability and review. Seeing a `lowerCase()` call would tell you that an implicit `this` pointer is being passed, and could be a signal during code review that a call has access to more information than needs, or may not be doing exactly what you think it does.\r\n\r\nUsing a distinct style for instance method names is also analagous with our existing convention for using `m_` prefixes in instance member variable names.",
