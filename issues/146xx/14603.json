   "body" : "We are an ATM company operating the wallet to supply our machines. In the last couple of months we have found that our coins keep getting stuck in the change address for quite some time, resulting in many failed transactions and a huge workload on our helpdesk. \r\n\r\nWhen this happens the balance disappears from the wallet and it appears empty. If you restart the node, the balance reappears and you can send 1 transaction and then the same thing happens again. \r\n\r\nWe have been using core for several years now with no prior issues. We have tried various versions (16, 16.3, 17) on several different servers but they all do the same thing now. It appears to be linked in some way to an uptick in unconfirmed transactions - https://www.blockchain.com/btc/unconfirmed-transactions\r\n\r\nToday this rose from 4k to 25k in a few hours and the majority of the txs appear to be for a fee and not much else, and once again our wallet has stopped working. \r\n\r\nHas something changed that would result in this issue or could this be caused by the 'ddos attack' on the bitcoin network? \r\n\r\nWe're running ubuntu 14 but we've also tried 17. Running on an SSD and an appropriate CPU. The general sever runs many wallets and BTC is the only issue. We have tried on a fresh server with nothing but the wallet on but this makes no difference. \r\n",
