(See [RFC1929](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1929) ÃÂ§2 for what the byte values are in an auth rejection reply.)\r\n\r\nRather unlikely: if the non-Tor SOCKS5 proxy behaves like Tor, in that it accepts any username/password pair, then you'll authenticate to it and it'll doÃ¢ÂÂ¦ something, maybe, depending on what type of proxy it is. Off the top of my head, the only SOCKS5 proxies I can think of (other than Tor) which accept random username/password pairs, are Tor [Pluggable Transports](https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en), which use the SOCKS5 username/password fields as a hack to pass keyword-value pairs from the outgoing client-side Tor process to the incoming client-side Pluggable Transport process (see ÃÂ§2.1.0.3 of [pt-spec.txt](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/pt-spec.txt)).",

      "body" : "> > @gmaxwell: We could do something more mild, like have each of our outbound connection indexes share a identifer with no loss...\r\n>\r\n> @laanwj: This would have the effect of reusing the same circuit when reconnecting quickly. I can imagine that would happen when a node boots you immediately, or for some reason you're cycling faster than every 10 minutes - if it takes longer a new circuit would be used automatically by Tor. \r\n\r\nYes, it would reuse the same circuit. However, if the exit node you were using suddenly won't allow you to reach your peer, Tor will automatically detach that \"stream\" (a.k.a. connection) from that bad circuit, and reattach it to a new circuit. Subsequently, if you try to use some other, previously-opened, outbound connection to a peer (which has the same index, and thus the same SOCKS5 username/password) which is still attached to that bad circuit, it'll get automatically reattached to the same new circuit as the previous streams with identical SOCKS5 username/passwords. Therefore, you won't keep connecting to the same suddenly-offline/censoring/misbehaving/whatever exit node, but Tor will automatically find a new working circuit for you, and still keep all your connections grouped by SOCKS5 username/password.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, you should group connections, when possible. It'll save on the number of total circuits needed, cutting the overhead by some O(M-N) where M is the total number of peers and N is the total number of peer \"groups\".\r\n\r\nIf that's difficult or annoying to do, or there's no potential use cases for grouping peer connections to the same circuit, then completely randomised SOCKS authentication is still much better than no SOCKS authentication at all.\r\n\r\nAlthough I've little authority to comment on the mergability of bitcoin patches, I did a quick read of @laanwj's patch 67a7949 and it looks pretty good to me.",

No token is sent.\r\n- If the proxy *requires* authentication then submitting random passwords will make it deny your connections just like submitting no password did before. I've never heard any requests requests for supporting authenticated proxies. However - such an option could be added trivially after this.\r\n- If the proxy *supports authentication*, but doesn't *require* it, then this may cause it to reject connections as a user/password is sent where it wasn't before. I think this is exceedingly rare apart from Tor. In this case `-proxyrandomize=0` will have to be passed to disable the behavior.\r\n\r\n@isislovecruft Thanks a lot for looking over the patch and commenting here!\r\n\r\n> So, yes, you should group connections, when possible. It'll save on the number of total circuits needed, cutting the overhead by some O(M-N) where M is the total number of peers and N is the total number of peer \"groups\".\r\n\r\nRight, makes sense. However in our case, outgoing connections are quite rare. We make only up to 8. So as I understand, it'll never create a huge number of circuits. This makes it less of an issue, I suppose?\r\n",
