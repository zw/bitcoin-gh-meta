Also, I don't think SigNet is the right place to test this. I'm not sure what the _OP_RETURN disconnection failure bug_ was, but I don't think there are enough transactions on SigNet to catch something like this.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think a script that `invalidateblock` blocks one by one starting from the tip while recording `hash(dumptxoutset)` or `gettxoutsetinfo` with coinstatsindex enabled - and then, once close to genesis, `reconsiderblock` for each block and compares the hash of the UTXO set, should be doable. I'm not sure if that's what was meant in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2839#issuecomment-21302247 with _a table with the proper utxo state for every height_.",

      "body" : "> I also think this approach addresses the request in OP. However, if we want to test this against mainnet I don't really see a particularly viable approach in terms of CI, without something convoluted like having a host running a pruned node that runs `verifychain 4 (tip_height-1)` on each new block (to disconnect and reconnect), and re-compiling and restarting on each new commit (or tag).\r\n\r\nI think you would want to cover the whole chain and not only new blocks. If a bug happens to be introduced, it could break on something that's in the chain already, not only on new blocks. I agree that running this on mainnet in some sort of CI for each commit is probably not possible and overkill. Periodically on `master`, maybe once a week could be enough.\r\n\r\nAlso like the idea of having it run once before a release. However, I don't think it should be the job of a maintainer. This only adds more work and costs to a job that very few want to do. For me, it took 14h on a beefy machine with 48GB of dbcache. However, I think it could be part of the reoccurring release-candidate testing issue and other contributors could pick it up and comment that this was part of their testing. \r\n\r\nfwiw: We'd still need to up the current max dbcache of 16GB to maybe 64GB, otherwise `verifychain 4 0` will OOM.
