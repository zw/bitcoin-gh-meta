The timeout in this PR is configured to be 6 months.\r\n\r\n> How it works\r\n> After a period of inactivity, a label will be applied to mark an issue as stale, and optionally post a comment to notify contributors that the Issue or Pull Request will be closed.\r\n> \r\n> If the Issue or Pull Request is updated, or anyone comments, then the stale label is removed.\r\n> \r\n> If no more activity occurs, the Issue or Pull Request will be automatically closed with an optional comment.\r\n\r\nThis could also help revive old pulls/issues that were forgotten by receiving the notification from the bot.\r\n\r\nNote: Merging the PR is not sufficient to activate the bot, it needs to be activated by maintainers [here](https://github.com/marketplace/stale).
