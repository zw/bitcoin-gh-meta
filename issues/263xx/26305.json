   "body" : "This is an alternative to #25600 in the deployment of full-rbf. After listening to feedback, rather to introduce a new service bit and automatic preferential peering to enable full-rbf transaction-relay paths among the interested peers, the default value of `mempoolfullrbf` is switched to 1. This change implies all the Bitcoin Core nodes will accept replacement of opt-out transactions at the next release (at the latest 25.0). Rather than a gradual construction of full-rbf transaction-relay paths due to node operators activating `mempoolfullrbf`, turning on by default the setting offer more visibility to the zero-conf services node operators.\r\n\r\nMailing list post coming soon to seek what has the preference between this deployment approach and the smoother #25600 approach among the development community and zero-conf services node operators.\r\n\r\n(One more approach could be to lock-in `mempoolfullrbf=1` with some flag day activation if one release cycle of time is gauged is not enough or not predictible enough)",
