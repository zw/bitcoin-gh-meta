      "body" : "With the same build on Ubuntu 22.04 I could not reproduce this error with a number of tests. I did however take a shortcut which could have influenced the outcome, namely only performing a ~10,000 block rescan, but using `bitcoin-cli -rpctimeout=5 rescanblockchain 750000` so that my bitcoin-cli call would time out in the same way as yours before the rescan was complete.\r\n\r\nThe first timeout is expected as the function call will likely not return before a full chain rescan is complete. In my tests I could still check rescan progress and cancel the scan with `abortrescan` as expected. Additional `bitcoin-cli` calls after the rescan was complete such as `listunspent` also still worked.\r\n\r\n`SIGPIPE` on `b-http` indicates that bitcoin-qt tried to write back to an RPC/REST socket, presumably the call from `bitcoin-cli rescanblockchain` in this case, and found it closed. However my tests indicate that Bitcoin Core (and libevent) is generally robust when trying to write back to closed FDs:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Log file for early cli return on rescanblockchain</summary>\r\n  \r\n```\r\n2022-10-19T21:25:10Z [libevent:debug] event_del: 0x7f7224004eb0 (fd -1), callback 0x7f7315b3ad70\r\n2022-10-19T21:25:10Z [libevent:debug] event_del: 0x7f7224004f30 (fd -1), callback 0x7f7315b3b500\r\n2022-10-19T21:25:10Z [libevent:debug] event_add: event: 0x7f7224004f30 (fd 21),  EV_WRITE   call 0x7f7315b3b500\r\n2022-10-19T21:25:10Z [libevent:debug] Epoll ADD(4) on fd 21 okay.
