I would be curious to learn that `listunspent` did not match `getbalance` for the wallet, as this is not something that I can see an obvious codepath for...\r\n\r\nI did manage to re-create \"losing\" UTXOs from a wallet. Setting the `walletbroadcast=0` flag on bitcoind and then making a transaction will result in tx hex beign returned, and the coins marked as \"used\". If the user does not save the transaction and broadcast it manually, the wallet will still [consider the UTXO spen](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L2222-L2225)t and require a reindex (or for a descriptor wallet can use `scantxoutset`). But this does not in my testing result in `listunspent` and `getbalance` getting out of sync, e.g. see this rudimentary [test](https://gist.github.com/willcl-ark/5a9cc5cc5a8744bd85537d34ef86eb72).\r\n\r\nWe can also see in the Miniwallet [source](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v24.0rc2/test/functional/test_framework/wallet.py#L164-L169) that it is somewhat (obscurely?) known that transactions might get \"lost\" if the transaction was RBFed after a re-org.",

The \"easy' way to resolve this would be to spend that UTXO. You could also attempt to modify the db directly and remove that particular record.\r\n\r\nIn terms of long term solutions, we could add a RPC that removes the record, but that seems potentially dangerous as that could work on any address that is used. We could also have a RPC to recompute the used state of each address. The question with that is whether a rescan should occur, or whether it should scan just `mapWallet`. Just `mapWallet` would be way faster, but transactions can be removed from it used `removeprunedfunds`.",
