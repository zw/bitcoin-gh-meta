This invalidity is only detected during the headers sync phase, and not during the new pre-sync phase that precedes it. The result is that your node goes through peers one by one, attempting to synchronize headers with them, by performing a full pre-sync phase, and only after that completes noticing they're giving us a known invalid chain.\r\n\r\nA question is whether we could detect this during the pre-sync phase instead, which wouldn't stop the lack of progress, but would avoid the bandwidth waste on repeated presyncs with everyone. The answer is yes - it wouldn't be hard to check for known-invalid headers in the presync phase as well, however, I don't think we want to do that because of fingerprinting reasons: it would permit an attacker to feed you an invalid, low-PoW, block during IBD, and then later follow you around the network by claiming to have a chain that extends this invalid block. If you stop fetching immediately, they know you're the same node as the one they gave the invalid block to earlier.\r\n\r\nThis fingerprinting is partially solvable: by keeping track of how much work was built on top of an invalid block, and if that work meets our anti-DoS threshold, permit reacting on known-invalid blocks when they're fed to us during presync. This is however a fair bit of complexity and I'm not sure it's worth it for just somewhat improving the situation for essentially broken nodes which will never recover anyway.\r\n\r\nPerhaps time is better spent on better reporting to the user, in the form of targetted warnings in logs (or even failure to start) when there appears to be a long invalid high-PoW chain out there.",
