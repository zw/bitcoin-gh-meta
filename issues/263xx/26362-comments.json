The reason to use them rather than the per block values, was some of the following review feedback:\r\n- Cumulative seems to be easier to use downstream https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19521#issuecomment-677958519\r\n- It's easier to go from cumulative to per-block rather than the other way around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19521#issuecomment-680409442\r\n\r\nI haven't gotten much feedback on use of the index lately and the use of the cumulative numbers was only in combination with not-yet-merged #19792 so I think removing the cumulative numbers should not be causing too many complaints. Pinging @PierreRochard \r\n\r\n> Is it important to report this number?
