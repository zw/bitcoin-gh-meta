Since there is a delay before the PR/issue is closed (7 days here), a maintainer could remove the `Stale` tag every 6 months or anyone could write a comment. Also, I believe that usually these parent PRs get activity by being referenced in sub-PRs so the delay before being stale is usually extended.\r\n\r\nThis may be preferable to having to manually check the activity of all PRs every once in a while?\r\n\r\n> Does this also have the issue of contributors not being able to reopen their own PRs that have been closed by this bot?\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with GitHub permissions sorry.",
