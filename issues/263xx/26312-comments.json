I was wondering if you could explain this a bit more.  It's been a while since i've done anything with int sockets but if I remember, it was in `C` (not C++).  Is `Sock` a C++ construct that makes it easier to Mock?\r\n\r\n> The tests are in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21878, feel free to look at them heart\r\n\r\nI looked over 21878 and I see there's some additional fuzz testing however I don't see the `Mocks` that this PR enables.  Am I missing the place where the Mocks are tested or is it yet to be added?  Would this PR be merged before 21878?",

We call it from the C++ code.\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21878 we would use that OS C API directly from all over the place. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint s = socket(...); // create the socket, see man 2 socket\r\n...\r\nconnect(s, to_addr); // see man 2 connect\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that in order to test it we have to create a real socket that really connects to the given address which is very inconvenient. It cannot be mocked.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21878 aims to replace all such calls to the operating system with constructs like\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSock sock = CreateSock(); // can return Sock, FuzzedSock, StaticContentsSock or another class that implements the interface\r\nsock->Connect(to_addr);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way a mock `Sock` class can be used and the high level code avoids calling the OS socket API at all in tests or dealing/touching `int` sockets at all. The last piece of that is the removal of `Sock::Get()` and changing the high level code which checks whether the `int` socket stored in `Sock` is `INVALID_SOCKET`.",

If I add them to this PR then this PR would be the same as https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21878.\r\n\r\nI created this PR as a smaller piece of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21878 to ease review. If you want to peek or fully review the tests, then see the last 4 commits in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21878.\r\n\r\n> or create a new PR with the Mocks before merging this one?\r\n\r\nBecause those tests depend on removing the `Sock::Get()` call which is done in this PR. If the tests get merged first, this may happen: `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection()` -> `CConnman::ConnectNode()` -> `i2p::sam::Session::Connect()` and later `i2p::sam::Session::~Session()` -> `i2p::sam::Session::Disconnect()` -> `Sock::Get()`. Calling `Get()` on `FuzzedSock` is a bit fishy, the high level code shouldn't peek at the internal `int` socket and make decisions based on its value.",
