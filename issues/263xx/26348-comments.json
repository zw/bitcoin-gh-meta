      "body" : "Interesting Script edge case!\r\n\r\nYou must have balanced the cost of proposing this standardness rule change, and making a PR touching consensus code, with switching to using Segwit scripts (either v0 or v1) which don't have this limitation (and have other advantages). Is there a particular reason why you can't migrate to Segwit?\r\n\r\n> Motivation for Changing Bitcoin's standard rules\r\n> Since having two execution paths for two different multisigs, one of them usually time-locked, is a very common use case, Bitcoin users can benefit from relaxing the standard rule and making two-paths multisigs standard.\r\nThe alternate way of having two-paths multisigs is by adding the CHECKMULTISIG at the end of every path. However, this reduces the maximum number of functionaries of the first (non time-locked) multisig, since the sum of both must be below 15.\r\n\r\nBitcoin users would probably just do that under P2WSH or Taproot nowadays. And that would be standard. But even under P2SH context it's far from being the only alternative. You could also just count public keys, for instance (untested):\r\n```\r\nIF\r\n  <pk_1> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  ...\r\n  <pk_n> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <m> EQUAL\r\nELSE\r\n  <timelock> CSV DROP\r\n  <pk_1'> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_3'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_4'> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <3> EQUAL\r\nENDIF\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a small number of pubkeys this is standard under P2SH, and the next limit you'd hit would probably be `MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE` that limits the size of the redeem Script.\r\n\r\nWriting Scripts by hand is a huge footgun, and we now have [tooling to do that safely](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). The implementation of Miniscript in Bitcoin Core does not support P2SH context. But [other implementations do](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) if you really can't migrate to at least Segwit v0.",

All the code that produces and interprets Bitcoin transactions is consensus code in RSK. \r\nOur current highest priority is to unblock the funds in the peg (currently one or more mining pools will temporarily help RSK to deliver the non-standard transactions into blocks, but this is far from ideal, as it affects RSK decentralization). \r\nWe cannot migrate to segwit as an emergency hard-fork. It would need months of development, months of testing, more months for activation on testnet, etc. We have already created a patch to migrate to the following redeem script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOP_NOTIF \r\n\t...\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_N \r\n\tOP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\nOP_ELSE \r\n\tâ¦\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_4 \r\n        OP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\nOP_ENDIF \r\n\r\n```\r\nBut this is still a hard-fork, and the full upgrade can take several weeks, considering the public review stage and all further stages.\r\n\r\nThe RSK community mid-term plan is to migrate to segwit. \r\n\r\nRegarding touching the consensus code, I firmly believe that GetSigOpCount() should be split in two functions: one that is called only by consensus code and one that is only called by AreInputsStandard(). This is obvious to me, since the standard rules can change over time, but not the consensus rules, and there is a real risk that a tweak of the standard rules ends up hiding an unintended consensus change. I was surprised to discover that GetSigOpCount() is called by consensus code with fAccurate==true and fAccurate==false, so basically that function should be set in stone.\r\n\r\nTherefore, even if the you are in doubt if the addition of two-paths multisigs is a benefit, I hope you still see the benefit to split GetSigOpCount() into two initially mirrored functions with different names, and we can do this in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n",

But proposing a standardness rule change does not seem like a short-term plan to me: even in the best case scenario that this PR is getting enough interest, review (i haven't looked at the code yet but it's currently failing CI) and gets eventually merged before the next release branch-off, then that a release gets shipped with the new standardness rule and that at least part of the nodes and hashrate upgrade to this new rule. That's what, 1 year at least before your transactions get relayed? Is it reasonable to rely on direct communication with mining pools for that long? And won't the switch to Segwit happen before that?",

      "body" : "Regarding the CI failure, I fixed it. But this brings an interesting topic to discuss (separate of this patch):\r\n\r\nInvalid scripts are detected obviously at some later moment and transactions containing invalid scripts are never accepted into the memory pool.\r\nHowever, in case GetStandardSigOpCount() detects and invalid script (i.e. staring with ENDIF)  it's difficult to decide what GetStandardSigOpCount() should return.  If it returns 0, you let a script containing too many checksigs be executed by the node. This is bad, but gives the node the opportunity to ban the peer that sent the invalid transaction. If it returns a high value, you avoid high computations, but at the same time you do not get the chance to penalize the peer that sent the bad transaction.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, on an invalid script detected:\r\n\r\noption 1) return 20 -> avoid heavy computations, do not penalize\r\noption 2) return 0 -> let  heavy computations be performed, penalize\r\noption 3) continue but  revert to how the old GetSigOpCount() worked\r\n\r\nMy code currently does 3, from the point the script is detected as invalid.",

Miners should aim to match nodes, not vice-versa.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the interesting discussion regarding who establishes the mempool policy, and I think this is a hot topic right now,  but in this particular case, that political discussion will just obfuscate the simple fact that enabling a two-path multisig is a simple, concrete, rational, logical and necessary step to support the federated networks use case. The existence of the Rootstock sidechain is a proof that the two-path multisig script is useful.\r\n\r\nTemporarily some miners will apply this patch, and then the rootstock community will switch to an alternate script (that supports less signatories) so that miners can later revert the patch. \r\nBut the expectation in the rootstock community is that Rootstock can go back to the previous script in ~1 year if most Bitcoin nodes and miners consider this script standard. Switching to segwit IS an alternative, but the rootstock core devs are extremely caution on upgrading this core functionality of Rootstock, as the risks are high.\r\n \r\n ",

      "body" : "> Therefore we can assume that MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS being low is a protection against quadratic-hashing attacks.\r\n\r\nI think `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS` is just `floor(MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE/CPubKey::COMPRESSED_SIZE) = floor(520/33) = floor(15.75..)` -- so the only way you could have more sigops than that is if you're doing multiple signatures by the same key (via `OP_DUP`) or if you're letting the signer provide keys as part of the p2sh stack.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I don't see how you get more than 10 normal keys in the script you've presented in the first place: the `NOTIF .. ELSE <h> CSV DROP 3 <e1> <e2> <e3> <e4> 4 ENDIF CHECKMULTISIG` part of your script will consume 148 bytes, leaving only 372 bytes for `<m> <key1> .. <keyn> <n>` which for n=10 consumes 342 bytes, and for n=11 would already overflow at 376 bytes. I believe that would cause a `SCRIPT_ERR_PUSH_SIZE` on the first run through of `EvalScript`, prior to the `SCRIPT_VERIFY_P2SH` run.\r\n\r\nPlaying with miniscript suggests a solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIF\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(K1)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(K2)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD TOALT\r\n  ..\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(Kn)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD\r\n  <m>\r\nELSE\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E1)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E2)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E3)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD TOALT\r\n  DUP HASH160 <hash(E4)> EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG FROMALT ADD\r\n  <d> CSV DROP\r\n  3\r\nENDIF\r\nEQUAL\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would let you have n=14 via a 508 byte script (n=15 gives a 536 byte script). (If your emergency keys are also valid for regular usage, you could increase that up to n=18).\r\n\r\nIn general, the pkh approach would allow up to 20 distinct keys in a p2sh script (eg, if you wanted a 20-of-20 multisig), absent the `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS` restriction. That makes me lean towards thinking it could make sense to increase `MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS` to 20.\r\n\r\n> Therefore, changing MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS to match exactly MAX_PUBKEYS_PER_MULTISIG, even if trivial, slightly degrades Bitcoin's DoS security.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is meaningfully true? You get `O(N**2)` hashing due to `N` being the number of signatures across the entire transaction (and also proportional to the overall size of the transaction), not just for a single input; so, assuming you're constrained to spending p2sh inputs, a 100kB tx would go from perhaps 1455 signatures (144MB of hashed data) to 1480 signatures (146MB of hashed data). (If you're able to construct bare multisig inputs, then you can do 1560 sigs in a standard tx (155MB of hashed data), though the setup for your attack will then be visible).\r\n\r\nI'm assuming a p2sh script of `<n> <pubkey> {DUP}*n <n> CHECKMULTISIG` for `n` equals 15 or 20 and that the signatures set R=G/2, to generate those numbers; I haven't checked how legacy hashing works in detail to be sure that actually generates `n` hashes over the entire tx rather than having some things cached.  Presuming you can't reuse signatures, and each signature is at least [57 bytes](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-November/000344.html) then a 100kB tx can't contain more than 1754 signatures, providing an upper bound of 175MB of hashing, presuming the interpreter is clever enough to only do one hash per signature.\r\n\r\nIn the worst conceivable case, where you somehow achieve 15 sigops with a 107 byte script (34 bytes to push a pubkey, 58 bytes to push a tiny exploitable signature, and 15 opcodes to generate 15 sigops from that), that would result in a 100kB tx requiring 1GB of hashing, while having 20 opcodes generate 20 sigops would result in 1.3GB of hashing (ie a 29% increase, vs the 33% increase of 20 vs 15).\r\n\r\nIf you're a miner, you're not constrained to 100kB txs, but in that case you're also not constrained by MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS either.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion:\r\n * I think that the `IF .. n CHECKMULTISIG ELSE .. 4 CHECKMULTISIG ENDIF` [approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26348#issuecomment-1301000985) is strictly superior to the original proposal, as neither are able to support n>11.\r\n * For a short-term workaround, if I were a miner, I think the lower complexity of just increasing MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS from 15 to 20 is more appealing than running this patch.\r\n * I think RSK switching to segwit or taproot makes more sense than spending much development effort here\r\n * If RSK or others really want to do n>11 via p2sh and not p2wsh/p2tr, then increasing MAX_P2SH_SIGOPS from 15 to 20 in general seems plausible to me, but it's not at all clear it's worth the effort of either being sure that it doesn't make quadratic hashing more problematic, or improving the interpreter's caching to prevent that from being a problem.",
