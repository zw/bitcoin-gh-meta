      "body" : "After reading your issue, I gave a reading of the Erebus attack and how asmaps are used as a potential method to make them far more complex. After reading it, I would like to explain why I think this feature might not be an excellent idea.\r\n\r\nLet me take an example to explain my point:\r\n\r\n- Say you studied the Internet maps, and your node identified the ten autonomous systems or potential bottlenecks (PB) in the world and connected to an IP belonging to each PB.\r\n- Now you decided that you don't want to be connected to two of those PB, so you told your node to avoid touching IPs.\r\n- But considering the limit of the extent to which Internet Maps are built, there is a finite chance that the rest of those 8 PBs are actually passing through a single master entity, and now you can be eclipsed.\r\n- In general, when all things are kept equal, the probability of 8 PBs controlled by a single entity will be higher than 10 PBs controlled by a single entity. So \"Banning\" a PB increase the chance of you getting eclipsed.\r\n\r\nThe example may sound far-fetched, but Erebus attacks are discussed considering the large entities (like Big IP provider) and Black Swans events in mind.\r\n\r\nOne thing I might have missed in this answer is the reasoning behind \"Banning\" a PB. So I would like to understand why someone would want to \"Ban\" a PB.",
