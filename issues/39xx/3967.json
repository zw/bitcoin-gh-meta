   "body" : "This is a simple user-friendliness fix.  The text of the \"spend unconfirmed change\" option is misleading.  It currently reads this way:\r\n\r\n     Spend unconfirmed change (experts only)\r\n\r\nThat implies that this option should only be selected if the user is an \"expert\" and non-expert users are seemingly warned not to select this option.  But in fact, that's the opposite of what the developers intended, because the intention was to recommend that users keep it selected.  So to communicate that to users, the text should actually be something like this:\r\n\r\n     Spend unconfirmed change (recommended)\r\n\r\nThis makes it clear that it's recommending that the user keep the option checked.  The text \"recommended\" is also less jarring to novice users than the ominous tone of \"experts only\", which implies possible grave consequences.",
