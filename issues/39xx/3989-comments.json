I did not want recursive makefiles because they tend to turn into dependency spaghetti, but some argued against a monolithic one when I was doing the autotools port, so I chose to compromise on that for the sake of the larger goal. Now, let's move on...\r\n\r\nNow we have some spaghetti. If the majority can agree that non-recursive would be cleaner now, I could be convinced to do the work.\r\n\r\nThe other main change that's necessary (as @laanwj saw elsewhere) is that libtool would be needed to do this cleanly. I chose to avoid libtool for the initial port since it can be a pain to use on some systems (win32). Since there's been very little outcry about not building on win32, I think it's probably safe to introduce this dependency now.",

For example, \"cd qt; make\" goes away, instead you'd use something like \"make qt\" from the top. This could be faked by adding stub makefiles at those levels that just do \"make -C ../ [target]\"\r\n- Likely to end up with one really huge Makefile.am. If we're careful, this could be split into some include files as we currently do. From a non-maintainer POV, this is a non-issue.\r\n\r\nWhat other drawbacks do you have in mind?",
