      "body" : "And immediately after making the pull request I realize half of it is missing - CreateNewBlock needs to be updated to create the required commitment outputs. I will make that fix.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr: Any required commitment increases the block size linearly, by the very nature of what you are doing. By adding a commitment to a block you have to at the very least add the bytes of the hash you are committing. This does it in a way which is more performant and immediately pruned from the UTXO set. And I think you may have misread req 1. My intent was that given the entire block or some transaction(s) in a Merkle proof, you know what to scan for to find the commitment.\r\n\r\nThe best system for coinbase commitments is p2pool's method. Such an approach is really not ideal. Beyond midstate being an ugly hack (not the least because some library SHA-256 implementations don't expose the necessary functionality to verify), it is also not performant. It would require the proofs to carry 32 bytes of midstate data, plus an average of 32 bytes of data prior to the commitment, and some metadata to indicate the start of the commitment within the string. That is 65 bytes of overhead plus the commitments which follow that you don't care about, which could be sizable in itself. This is a rather large waste of space, especially for applications which demand compact proofs, e.g. merged mining headers and compact spv proofs.",

      "body" : "Well a proof is just 80 bytes block header + untaken Merkle paths + extra data at the (sub-)transaction level + a few bytes metadata. So for just the coinbase and one commitment that is 80 + 32 + 1-2 bytes. That's about 50% increase on a minimal block, but percentage-wise that's a worst case since the overhead is constant but the proof size increases logarithmically with the number of transactions. With a 1000 transactions in the block it is a 16% increase. Still significant.\r\n\r\nUsing the coinbase transaction with midstate also has one other glaring problem: you are unprotected from length-extension attacks. You can't know for certain if the string given is actually a commitment, or just something that looks like it inside of a giant PUSHDATA. This can be somewhat mitigated against with economic arguments by using radix trees with a single root commitment, making this root commitment required, and making it illegal to put anything after it in the coinbase transaction. Then at least any PUSHDATA trickery would also invalidate the block.\r\n\r\nUsing a radix tree with a single exposed root hash (in the coinbase or its own transaction) is less space efficient for proofs, because if they are separate transactions then you can put them consecutively and align on a corresponding power-of-2 boundary in order to reduce the number of transaction-tree Merkle branches required, vs. the radix tree approach which doesn't let you save space from the transaction Merkle tree and requires new untaken branches for commitments you don't care about (whereas that would otherwise be amortized over the size of the transaction list). It's also messier because you've added (1) the radix tree implementation (although, yes, I want that for other purposes), and (2) the tree data still needs to be transported with the block, since validation rules will depend on these commitments being correct (e.g. [U]TXO hash-tree commitments). You'd have to include the serialized radix tree in the p2p block message, on disk in the block files, and anywhere else in the bitcoin ecosystem which transmits or archives full blocks for consumption by a validator. That's a lot more code to change, and a bigger disruption to the bitcoin ecosystem.",

The rest of this comment mostly summarizes things that have already been said.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, using the midstate is a bit hackish, but it isn't vulnerable to a length-extension attack, as maaku said, since there's only one root commitment hash fixed at the end of the coinbase transaction.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, everything's possible without a Bitcoin rule change, without creating any new transactions and using constant space in Bitcoin blocks, at the expense of about (64 bytes) + (32 bytes)*log2(number of types of commitments present in a block) for every block used in a commitment proof. (If the commitment root were padded so that it starts on a SHA-block boundary, the 64 bytes would decrease to 32 bytes, wasting on average about 32 bytes in every Bitcoin block.)\r\n\r\nThe other wrinkle is that if Bitcoin miners started validating the UTXO commitment, (only) the relevant Merkle branch within the radix tree would have to be forwarded around the Bitcoin network among nodes that care, requiring database and protocol changes for them.",

It would be possible to create a commitment that validating miners would treat as not a commitment at all, by stuffing it in a PUSHDATA. In the same vein, you'd need to make sure that a block doesn't have a commitment for a certain validation type if you think the block doesn't have it, which would be difficult to prove with P2Pool's approach.\r\n\r\nFor commitments that will require validation (SPV/non-SPV UTXO trees), P2Pool's solution is probably not the best choice. For everything else, it probably is.",

However we can do a slightly less drastic soft-fork to require (U)TXO commitments to be valid, while still allowing miners to choose to not make the commitment. In this case the miners who chose not to calculate the commitment would provide a short and simple proof that the commitment didn't exist in their block. Completing the upgrade would be another soft-fork to *require* that the commitment not exist, thus upgrading the (U)TXO format and allowing the related code and indexes to be eventually removed.",

It is also strictly speaking less capable as it doesn't allow for frictionless non-consensus commitments--with the current solution you can pick a random UUID as the commitment type and have some assurance against namespace collision. I have to admit this isn't a strong argument however, as it is not clear to me that such an applicaiton would be useful.\r\n\r\nMore seriously, it's hard to avoid the spend-a-coinbase-output scheme however. The inputs need to be restricted such that no fees can be given, otherwise you break the secuirty model by opening up the possibility of paying for incorrect or malicious commitments. In the coinbase commitment scheme this is trivial -- the one and only input is an anyone-can-spend. If you instead specify commitment type by position, then you still need at least one input by protocol rules, but because it is not required to be an anyone-can-spend you've now got to either make the same arbitrary restrictions on input value, or worry about economic attacks..",
