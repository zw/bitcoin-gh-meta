I'm prepared for heavy scrutiny on this one since it's a dangerous area. Suggestions are very welcome.\r\n\r\nA new class (CScriptNum) has been created to be a subset of the former usage of Bignum. Operands are signed 32bit, but they may overflow after an operation, so an int64_t is used to represent the internal value.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of easier reviewing, I left out any functions and operators that weren't already in-use, and made minimal changes to existing names and conventions.",
