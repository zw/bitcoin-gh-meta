After all, if this really was a trivial change, I wouldn't have written a fifteen line git commit description!\r\n\r\nThat said... one good thing about merging it at the beginning of the v0.12.0 development cycle, is that it's a change that's highly unlikely to lead to actual loss of funds, so we'll give the whole ecosystem plenty of time to find and fix the off-by-one type errors that are probably still out there in various wallets.
