   "body" : "Now that the off-by-one error w/nLockTime txs issue has been fixed by 87550eefc1131132e940efcaf296bb399eeb02df (75a4d512cfc9a451fa627a3487ffed102cc67cab in the 0.11 branch) we can make the anti-fee-sniping protection create transactions with nLockTime set such that they're only valid in the next block, rather than an earlier block. This makes the protection actually effective for its intended purpose.\r\n\r\nThere was also a concern about poor propagation, however testing with transactions with nLockTime = GetAdjustedTime()+1 as a proxy for nLockTime propagation, as well as a few transactions sent the moment blocks were received, has turned up no detectable issues with propagation. If you have a block at a given height you certainly have at least one peer with that block who will accept the transaction. That peer will certainly have other peers who will accept it, and soon essentially the whole network has the transaction. In particular, if a node recives a transaction that it rejects due to the tx being non-final, it will be accepted again later as it winds its way around the network.\r\n\r\nI do *not* think this should go in v0.11 Rather by including this in the devel branch for v0.12 we have an opportunity to continually remind wallet authors and the like about how the anti-fee-sniping protection is supposed to work, and remind them that nLockTime = next block transactions should be accepted. My testing turned up only blockchain.info and Bitcoin Core itself as having issues with nLockTime at the limit transactions; hopefully by the time v0.12 is released these wallets will all be fixed.",
