      "body" : "After researching the issue some over the weekend, I agree with @laanwj.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this is an issue with gcc5 and newer clang+lto when qt is built with -reduce-relocations. Upstream GCC discussion is [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65886). \r\n\r\nWe have a few options:\r\n- Do nothing. I think I'd prefer this, reasoning below.\r\n- use -PIC instead for known-problematic compilers. This would mean maintaining a black-list since I don't believe this can be easily tested.\r\n- Use -PIC instead only when building bitcoin-qt _and_ using a problematic compiler _and_ when qt was built with -reduce-relocations (this can be tested via preprocessor).\r\n- Default to -PIC everywhere and override with -PIE when creating release binaries.\r\n\r\n2 and 3 would be necessary only for building bitcoin-qt, but we'd end up having to disable PIE for bitcoind as well, to avoid building 2 sets of objects.\r\n\r\nI believe that the root issue here is that distros are shipping qt libs with -reduce-relocations, which is known to violate abi specs and makes assumptions about how downstreams will use their libs. That abi spec violation became a real-world issue with the latest compilers.\r\n\r\nSo IMO, the more reasonable thing to do here would be to try to convince Arch to disable -reduce-relocations for their qt build. We can't be the only downstream with this issue.",
