   "body" : "I have 3 hard drives - one internal, two external. Creating a custom data directory works on 2 of my drives (the internal, and one external), but doesn't work on my third hard drive. The problem is, I don't have space to store the 50GB+ blockchain on the two drives it works on. The one it doesn't work on is a terrabyte drive - bitcoin's window acknowledges there's 600GB of free space on it. \r\n\r\nBut when I write a path on that drive, and press ok, it creates what look to be the correct file structure, but opens with an error message saying: \r\n\r\n```\r\nError opening block database.\r\nDo you want to rebuild the block database now?\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can abort, or press ok. If i press ok it says \"Error opening block database\" and quits. Dick.. How can I debug what's going on here?",
