E.g. the gcc in Ubuntu 12.04 is 4.6, which does not support the full set of C++11 [though it can be done with some trickery](http://charette.no-ip.com:81/programming/2011-12-24_GCCv47/).\r\n\r\nThe compiled executables in releases will still work on the same platforms, since the build has been switched to static libstdc++ since #5819.\r\n\r\n(see also: compile with C++11 standard and update to modern constructs #4025)\r\n",
