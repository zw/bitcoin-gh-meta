Anything with 4 or more leading zeroes is converted to scientific notation which is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nFor instance from the command line, all 3 of 0.00001, .00001 , and 1e-05 used to work, now only the first will be correctly parsed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the command line behavior is intended, but I think we need a convenient way to send the right format from the test framework.\r\n\r\nThis breaks at least smartfees.py\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli : ping\r\n\r\n\r\n",
