I assume they are just not bothering to set a custom limit.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if we are currently using 400kb, and the number of transactions continue to increase at the current rate, it won't be long before that number increases, and it's going to take a while for miners to get up to date so I feel it's better to increase it a bit now, while we wait for consesus around the 'hard' block size limit increase, or other viable solutions to scalability to come along.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that the data Luke has used removes 'Microtransactions' and transaction which Luke has classified as 'Inefficient/data use of the blockchain', but nevertheless are still occurring.

Computing the average for the whole day, they get 20, so in order to optimize costs, they reduce their switching hardware capacity to 20 parallel phone calls. Does it make sense?\r\n\r\nObviously, no. If people will find that they can't use phone during the day, they will believe that quality of this company's service is extremely poor and phone is pretty much useless.\r\n\r\nThere is in fact  a branch of operations research called queueing theory which studies things like that, and can be used, among other things, to find optimal capacity. But who needs these complexities when you use **average**, the pinnacle of mathematical thought (according to Luke-jr)?",

Though that said bigger picture discussion is better off on the mailing list, and/or forums like reddit.\r\n\r\nRe: default blocksize, what should actually happen is it should be removed and replaced by a calculation that takes orphan risk into account. Basically, every transaction you add increases the chance of orphaning your block by some amount due to the larger size. If you know that marginal increase you can then keep a running tally of total block reward and stop adding transactions when marginal reward > marginal cost. As it turns out that constant can be calculated from the orphan rate and your own hash rate relatively easily, and orphan rate can be observed. (IIRC the constant basically has bytes/second as its units) There is the nuance that much of the hashing power has special peering setups that push orphan rate to near zero; your blocks don't necessarily get to participate in those peering setups. \r\n\r\nOf course, actually writing that patch and setting the default marginal orphan rate constant appropriately would be a great backdoor way of increasing the default max blocksize to 1MB. :)",

      "body" : "> Back to the point though, I think it is a good idea to set the default block size soft limit to the same value as the hard limit. Miners can make use of it if it is useful to them.\r\n\r\nI extremely disagree with this, what's the point of having two limits if they are the same. At the very very least if the consensus limit is 1000k, the default policy limit should be 950k.\r\n\r\n> I think we should either keep the 750K soft limit and see how high transactions fees must rise until miners realize they're \"leaving money on the table\" and raise the -blockmaxsize themselves.\r\n\r\n+1\r\nI wouldn't oppose to make it configurable though, but these long discussions about changing policy defaults are annoying.",
