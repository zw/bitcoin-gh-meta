   "body" : "This PR makes a new RPC command called `getaddressinfo` which relies on the wallet. It contains all of `validateaddress`'s address info stuff. Those parts in `validateaddress` have been marked as deprecated. The tests have been updated to use `getaddressinfo` except the `disablewallet` test which is the only test that actually uses `validateaddress` to validate an address.",
