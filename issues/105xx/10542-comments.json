And it's a question if it's worth it.\r\n\r\nGot it. Thanks for the comments. Should I close the issue now?",

It could still be possible now I think.\r\n\r\nSince you have to recover pubkey from the signature right now, you can go to pubkeyhash and scripthash, given you somehow know the script format (in this case, p2sh-p2wpkh).\r\n\r\nThe signer would sign the message with his private key; the verifier would try that the pubkey in the signature generates the given address through p2sh, which would mean the signature is valid.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I can think of is that you are then proving both the ownership of the p2pkh and the p2s-p2wpkh addresses, but it doesn't really matter.",

Important for proof of holdings.\r\n\r\nI do not expect that blockchain.info will necessarily let you lookup the base address for a SegWit or Bech32 address? I can understand that it may be necessary for this use to possibly provide an additional field for the encoded resultant address (can be automatically populated) which if used should and different to the signing address (using GUI terminology) should be verified to be a correct resultant against the signing address or equal to it and, appended to the message before signing. The signed message will then be increased by two new lines and one address. (hopefully in the format `bitcoin:{address}`) This will need a mechanism to prevent fraud. - Or, can blockchain.info be updated to work if it currently won't?\r\n\r\n# Does blockchain.info show balances for addresses that are in cold storage?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n>... is there any way for me in another country to confirm that what my colleague views is actually accurate and correct?\r\n\r\nSince they use Bitcoin Core, yes, there is a way to verify that they hold the addresses that they claim. Have them sign a message with each address that they claim to have the holdings on, using Bitcoin Core you can verify that they indeed have those addresses and check them on blockchain.info to find the current balance.\r\n\r\nOnly works in Bitcoin Core currently for addresses starting with a '1' (not Segwit addresses starting with a '3' and not Bech32 addresses starting with 'bc1' - the developers are aware of this and I will remind them shortly.)\r\n\r\nIn Bitcoin Core, your transaction opposite goes to File -> Sign Message and signs any message with one of the holding addresses. Copy the message, address and signature and send to you via probably plain text format email is the easiest. Repeat for each additional address holding the balance of BTC that they are offering to sell.\r\n\r\nIn Bitcoin Core, you go to File -> Verify Message and key the details provided EXACTLY - spaces, new lines and all characters must be an EXACT match. Click on verify and voilÃÂ .\r\n\r\nI prefer the form of signed message as follows (don't key the top and bottom bar rows for the message, just the contents and you can check this yourself, the bottom row is the signature). I like to key the address used for verifying as a part of the message but that is not strictly necessary:\r\n\r\n    ------------------------------\r\n    Something that I want to sign.\r\n    \r\n    bitcoin:1PMUf9aaQ41M4bgVbCAPVwAeuKvj8CwxJg\r\n    ------------------------------\r\n    Signture:\r\n    IGaXlQNRHHM6ferJ+Ocr3cN9dRJhIWxo+n9PGwgg1uPdOLVYIeCuaccEzDygVgYPJMXqmQeSaLaZVoG6FMHPJkg=\r\n\r\nThis contains all of the compact information necessary to verify the message.\r\n\r\nExample of verified message:  \r\n![verified message][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zv1xq.png ",

I thought the whole idea of message signing is to prove the ability to spend UTXOs associated with specific keys, therefore key hashes, therefore addresses. So why not to allow to verify message-signatures associated with those public keys if it's possible given whatever address?",

Furthermore, it's inherently restricted to single-key addresses which is problematic for multiple reasons (the verifier shouldn't need to care what the prover uses, and standards limited to single-key uses may disincentivize people from adopting safer multisig construction).\n\nA proposal to deal with this in a generic way is in BIP322, which has recently picked up some steam. It treats addresses simply as the script they represent, and requires a signature that is verified using the script interpreter itself. This means that in theory it should work for whatever script/address.",

This sounds like KYC, which isn't something we want to encourage?\r\nIt _is_ KYC, but for _holding knowledge_ (the private key), not for an identity attached to a human being.  The purpose is that once you prove to me that you have a certain piece of knowledge, you can show that whoever holds that piece of knowledge created a particular lightning invoice for the amount *I* owe to whoever holds that piece of knowledge, so that once I pay it (and have the preimage from the hash in the invoice), I have solid proof that my debt is paid.  The tech I seek is NOT for identification in a way that can be used against people, but in a way that can make payers safe from claims that a payment went to the wrong party.

This is however just a technicality. In BIP322 you can have message signatures from a multisig address (where just a threshold signs, and there is no \"the\" private key), or if you'd have an address that corresponds to script OP_TRUE, anyone would be able to \"sign\" for it, as anyone would be able to spend from it.\n\nSo I think the point is that in an ideal world, someone verifying a message signature shouldn't know or care about the fact that there is a single private key corresponding to that address.

One example:\r\n\r\nPoloniex support asked me to sign message with a bitcoin address which was used for withdrawal in past. I had issues accessing my account so this was done to verify I own this Poloniex account without doing any KYC.\r\n\r\nSigning message with a bitcoin address and verifying it is possible right now using Electrum wallet and even Joinmarket added it in https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/pull/841\r\n\r\nSo what is being used when users sign the message in electrum and what is being verified? Can someone else sign a message with this bitcoin address using Electrum? `tb1qr3m8k7ps0cehz6dcwz0fyhsdv9h9dlcmxusz4m` If yes, then maybe signing option is useless. If no, it does prove that I own the private key for this address isn't it? Or at least I am willing to associate myself with this bitcoin address and someone can send me BTC to the address used for signing.\r\n\r\nI understand this comment and it makes sense: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10542#issuecomment-306573998 and also comment by sipa that there is no public key to verify for segwit addresses. \r\n\r\nAgain two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Then how is it working in Electrum and Joinmarket?\r\n2. Is this a workaround? To sign messages with private key: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10542#issuecomment-519930143 and verify with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10542#issuecomment-453906613 ?\r\n",

      "body" : "@prayank23 Presumably @luke-jr is referring to the fact that a signature with address A and message M means that whoever has control over address A (i.e. the ability to move coins sent to that address) agrees with that message. You can't use it to determine who the sender is however, because Bitcoin addresses do not have a sender address; they only have input coins and those coins may have an address they were previously under control of. In the case of a service provider that has one wallet shared by multiple users, the apparent \"sender\" address may belong to a different user (i.e., sending to it would credit someone else). Another example: using \"sender\" address signatures in a payjoin transaction would permit your joining partners to sign for you, as they too have an address that looks like a \"sender\".\n\nAs far as what Electrum and other software does: they're probably extending the old signmessage format to segwit addresses in an ad-hoc manner (just a bit to indicate \"p2wpkh\" for example). This is trivial to do, but we've been loathe to do something like this, because it doesn't scale. It cannot support multisig, and would need continuous updates to support new address schemes (e.g. Taproot) leading to a compatibility nightmare.

However, developmemt seems to have stalled around it.\r\n\r\nWill research more about this. I had a follow up question not sure if it's offtopic.\r\n\r\nCan signing and verifying of messages be used for 2FA or normal authentication? Example: few darknet websites had this option to save your PGP public key when you sign up and user needs to decrypt random messages on each login which were encrypted using this key. Can bitcoin address replace PGP public key in this case? So a user will add one bitcoin address during registration. A random string is shared on each login, user needs to **sign it with bitcoin address** and it will be verified for successful authentication. \r\n\r\nLNURL-AUTH is also interesting which can be used to register/login with LN wallet. Not sure about the technical details but few libraries available to test it: https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-lnurl#libraries and it involves **signing** of [challenges](https://xn--57h.bigsun.xyz/lnurl-auth.html).",
