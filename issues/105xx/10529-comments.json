If a users has a particular cause for a different value (like a very slow system), then he can simply to override it, using the `systemctl edit bitocind.service` approach mentioned in the added comment block. That is what I meant with \"should be set individually\". The idea is that systemd's default are reasonable for most cases, and if it doesn't work for someone, then systemd allows you override the defaults. I could be wrong, but I don't see a reason why bitcoind should always need TimeoutStartSec set to 120s, instead of the default value (90s).",

Personally, I would just want to use bitcoin logging, though, so logs can be more easily deleted if they contain private information, or if I enable verbose debugging and want to reclaim space. I would also leans towards using bitcoin logging here just to avoid adding unnecessary config overrides and differences between the way bitcoin functions inside and outside of systemd.",
