It only takes a few hundred thousand to push it into low, yet still problematic double digit false positive territory.\r\n\r\nI also don't fully understand the comment in the code that claims this uses 1.7MB.  I calculated the filter size myself using the parameters from the code and I get about 430k each, for around 960k total.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the attack surface here involves filling up the bloom filter and causing a high false positive rate which can blind nodes to incoming transactions.  If a bloom filter is used here, I think it needs to be larger.  (Maybe that was the intention?)\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n",
