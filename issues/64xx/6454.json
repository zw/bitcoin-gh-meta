   "body" : "When using a python bitcoin RPC client, I sometimes encounter errors like:\n\n```\n>>> proxy._call(\"getblock\", \"45b0efe24da4ed0f984a8808e04b584a78cedaa8b49ac9097f724d368d0871df\")\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/bitcoin/rpc.py\", line 142, in _call\n    'Content-type': 'application/json'})\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/http/client.py\", line 1065, in request\n    self._send_request(method, url, body, headers)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/http/client.py\", line 1093, in _send_request\n    self.putrequest(method, url, **skips)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/http/client.py\", line 948, in putrequest\n    raise CannotSendRequest(self.__state)\nhttp.client.CannotSendRequest: Request-sent\n```\n\nWhen this error is received, I find that:\n- `bitcoin-cli` and other RPC clients cannot get bitcoind to respond, they hang\n- only way to kill bitcoind is to SIGKILL it?\n- RPC threads seem locked, syscalls were all waits or recvs\n- on testnet in this state, bitcoind continues normal p2p gossip\n\nReplication steps:\nhttps://gist.github.com/kanzure/57f1b50cf7fb82cc5c1a\n\nReplication steps summary:\n- `setgenerate true 1000`\n- when `setgenerate` is running, send another RPC request\n- kill the client that sent the other RPC request\n- when `setgenerate` is done, RPC will be unavailable\n- use `rpcthreads=1` to help see this behavor\n\nExpected behavior is that the RPC thread should eventually be available again.\n\nRelevant commits:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/16a5c18cea7330bd68dc9d2f768eb518af88795b\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7d2cb485116636595250fce4ea4eab16a877479b\n\nRelevant issues:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5655#issuecomment-70162936\n\nUsing `rpckeepalive=0` solves this problem, although the above commit messages make it sound like this is only a temporary fix. So hopefully others can replicate this problem now with the steps given above. Alternatively, #5677 should fix this too.\n\nFWIW, I was completely unable to determine that this was a keep-alive problem when I was receiving error messages. Only once I started reading commit history on the rpcserver file did I find that rpckeepalive was meant to help with this issue. So maybe this is a docs issue.....\n",
