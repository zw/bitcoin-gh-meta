      "body" : "@sipa   Neither is the answer.  Perhaps it needs commenting though.  If the transaction is accepted into the reserve space and stagedelete is non-empty then it is both safe and desirable to evict any transactions that were staged.   If the transaction is not accepted into the reserve space, then as before we return failure from ATMP before we have a chance to evict anything.\r\n\r\nThe one slight caveat is in the case where you pass entry into the reserve space, but then you fail the rate limiter code directly below it.  In that case, it probably wasn't very fair that your feesDeleted were causing you to be counted as a free transaction.  It's overly conservative and rare behavior though.  I was planning on suggesting a fix but I wanted to see if there were any thoughts on the free relay code remaining in place here before I complicated it.  The suggested fix is that if the transaction is entering the mempool via the reserve space, and then it fails the rate limiter code, you let it in anyway but just wipe stagedelete.  Note that if stagedelete were empty then the tx by definition wouldn't have been subject to the rate limit test because it has a multiple of the minRelayFee.",

      "body" : "@dgenr8 This conversation has been spread over a couple of PR's and IRC, so I apologize if I'm repeating a prior argument, but I think it would be good to explain the reasoning behind the logic in this pull.\r\n\r\nPrior to limiting the mempool (or having RBF implemented), we had protection against bandwidth spamming attacks by requiring all transactions that were relayed to be accepted into the mempool and have either fee or priority.  Since those transactions are now in the mempool and can't be recalled, those fees are now at risk for being consumed by being included in a block.  This pull isn't meant to provide some new protection against that attack, but is only meant to protect against OOM attacks by ever expanding mempools.   However, it must be sure not to break that pre-existing protection.\r\n\r\nOnce we create a way for transactions to be removed from the mempool, we have to realize that the fees placed on those transactions are no longer at risk.   The approach we've been using is to say that (modulo transactions that have already been mined) the mempool must contain enough fees to pay for the relay cost of all transactions that have been historically broadcast whether they are still in the mempool or not.  What this prevents is someone replacing or evicting their own transactions \"cheaply\" and thereby achieving free relay of their original transactions.   The fact that there might be a race to get into the mempool before it fills up is a slight aberration that occurs as a one off.  We still need a mechanism by which to adjust the minimum relay fee over time in the event that it is too small to dissuade spam. \r\n\r\nYour concern about a monster transaction of low fees preventing a small transaction from getting in the mempool is addressed in 4 separate ways in this pull.  \r\n1) Multiple attempts are made to evict transactions, so being unlucky and trying against one large transaction is insufficient to block  you.\r\n2) Some portion of the mempool space is reserved for higher and higher fee transactions.  That space is not cheaply fillable with spam and should serve to act as a temporarily higher min relay rate which will keep the relay path open for high fee paying tx's (large or small).\r\n3) Any tx's occupying the reserve space are periodically looked at in aggregate and used to remove large tx's or chains of tx's from the bottom of the mempool that would otherwise be unevictable.\r\n4) There is a time based eviction mechanism as a last fall back.\r\n\r\nNo doubt further improvements are possible, but I think this is a good step in the right direction.",

The person who pays is the unlucky evictor.  Evictee gets a chance at cheap fees, and others who come after eviction could pay even less, since there might then be extra space for them.\r\n\r\nThe case where evictor == evictee could be handled explicitly, if it were actually possible to target this kind of replacement with all the factors that affect the selection of the evictees, such as propagation variation, node start time variation, mining, and nodes having different mempool size limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I would at the very least move them to globals/server ot something, but whatever...\r\nIt would be much nicer if you make them an attribute of an existing class that is used as a global (say, mempool or globalPolicy). Here's a commit in which you can see what I would like to move towards: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/5a42e278c64468e1e0f3ee24e10710b91c754082\r\nI've been trying to do something like that since 2014 but unfortunately there's still no right place for introducing new policy options and people keep doing everything in main. Next step is #6068 (still without the preparations in util that you could reuse, let me know if you want me to separate those preparations).\r\n\r\nEven if you don't do it \"the right way\" ( @luke-jr wanted to create a dynamic GUI form for command line options using something like https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/5a42e278c64468e1e0f3ee24e10710b91c754082#diff-01e64f27a2a21a3116825fa22aee0537R30 ), for the case of -maxmempool and -mempoolexpiry, you could at least put them in CTxMempool.\r\nIf we want them in policy (no strong opinion), the easiest thing IMO is leaving them as locals for now (even though that's not very efficient) and hide them in CStandardPolicy or the policy estimator later.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever, there's many things to cleanup already and everybody is doing it wrong, even for new policy options (like fRequireStandard), so why would you spend any \"mental power\" on putting new things in the right place when you're actually solving an urgent problem?\r\nDo everything in main like everybody else and hopefully it will be cleaned up eventually.\r\n",

It strikes me that having a floating relay fee added has a necessary dynamic effect ~ the purpose of the floating relay, as discussed in #6455, is to dampen the effect of the limited memory pool, and make it more constant over time.\r\n\r\n2) Noted from prior remarks I have made in #6455 that a mempool is not necessarily needed (e.g., relay nodes would not need to be using a mempool; the wallet nodes, would be using a mempool, as was indicated).\r\n\r\n3) It was my understanding that there was [a resolution](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6201#issuecomment-122512074) that \"Mempool limiting and dynamic fee determination are superior to a static parameter change\" at the end of #6201, which when closed led to #6455 and now, to this pull request.\r\n  \r\n    So, why not time based expiration as well as a floating relay fee?  Just curious.",
