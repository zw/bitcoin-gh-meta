      "body" : "\r\nThere are a couple of considerations to take into account here:\r\n\r\n1. This only prunes the blockstore, it does not keep disk usage beneath the pruning target. I think this should be called out a little more clearly.\r\n2. The pruning target is just that, a target, sometimes the target will be overshot a bit. Maybe this can be alluded to in the UI, or maybe it's for the release notes.\r\n3. Enabling pruning essentially binds a given instance to its wallet.  That is, once pruned, you can no longer import addresses, keys or wallets without a full resync.  Since this is an hours long operation, I think there should probably be some warning.\r\n4. Enabling pruning disables several node functions that support the network, such as historical block service and serving of proofs to SPV clients, most GUI users probably don't care, but it's a side effect.\r\n\r\nWhile there are certainly differing opinions on this, I personally believe that the pruning feature at this stage is still somewhat experimental and has side effects that only people who are paying close attention will be aware of.  With time, some of these side effects will go away or be minimized, but if there's going to be a GUI element, I think it makes sense to call this out and direct the user to the release notes.  If someone turns it on and it results in an unexpected multi-hour sync being required, that's pretty bad UX.   \r\n\r\nHonestly, I'd err on the side of requiring the user to manually supply the option in the config file as I believe users that are willing to do this are more likely to have read the release notes and fully understand the ramifications of turning it on.",
