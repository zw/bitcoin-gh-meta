Without that change, nodes that received a headers message would otherwise wait to download blocks through the existing parallel fetch mechanism, which would generally make headers-announcement inferior to inv-announcements (because we have direct-fetch code in the inv-processing logic, which means we'd be quicker to request a new block).\r\n\r\nConsequently I think it makes sense for nodes to somehow opt-in to the new behavior.  0.10 and 0.11 nodes should continue to receive inv's even after this code is merged.\r\n\r\nOne thing that wasn't clear to me was whether it's really necessary to do the protocol version bump in order to deploy the new p2p message, given that the new message is backwards compatible -- nodes are free to ignore it.  However I'm not sure I have a good grasp of how the protocol versions should be thought about.\r\n",

If a remote nodes are allowed to switch preferences mid-stream, it can greatly (and needlessly) complicate the local node's sending logic.\r\n\r\nThe easy way to avoid that is to disallow changing the preference _back_ once set (this seems to be the case in @sdaftuar's BIP). Taking that a step further, it also makes sense to only accept the message early in the connection process, say directly after version/verack, and before any inv. And if that's the case, it may as well just be considered as part of the handshake.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I would much prefer to avoid making life-of-the-connection properties stateful unless necessary. Extending the version message makes sense to me, but I understand @sipa's objection there. \r\n\r\n@gmaxwell's suggestion seems reasonable, assuming that the \"flags\" message had the requirement of being sent directly after version/verack. Absence of the message would actively (though perhaps unknowingly) communicate the desire for default flags (historic behavior). Again, this just seems like an extension of the version message to me, but if changes there are deemed problematic, this would be my preference.",

Turns out there's an unusual feature in the getheaders handling, where we set `pindexBestHeaderSent` to `chainActive.Tip()` in two situations: if we actually are sending the tip, or if we have nothing to send.  I think the latter case can only happen if our peer has our tip in their locator, so I believe this behavior is desirable, if surprising.\r\n\r\nI've added a comment to the relevant line of code in main.cpp explaining this behavior.",

      "body" : "Pushed a commit to address @morcos' comments.\r\n\r\nIn cleaning up the RPC test I was surprised with what happens to `pindexBestHeaderSent` when a peer sends a getheaders with a locator that is up-to-date with our tip.  Though I took out the code to parse the locator and update `pindexBestKnownBlock`, it turns out that if we generate no headers to return then we will end up setting `pindexBestHeaderSent` to equal `chainActive.Tip()`.  \r\n\r\nThis behavior was just due to a quirk in the code (the test that does that is checking to see if we've walked off the end of chainActive and assumes that if we're at a NULL pointer then we must have returned our tip to the peer), but I believe this is correct behavior.  I added a comment to the code explaining this quirk, but am leaving it in because I think it's correct and beneficial.\r\n\r\nOn a separate note: I was reminded when I looked at this again that if a peer sends us a getheaders with a locator that is caught up to our tip, then we'll send back an empty headers message.  Is it important that this behavior be preserved?  I left it unchanged for now, but I can clean this up and suppress an empty response if it's safe to do so, either in this pull or separately.\r\n",

      "body" : "I discovered there were some problems in the direct fetch logic.\r\n\r\nThe code was structured so that we could only direct fetch blocks which were announced in a set of headers.  However, in the case of a reorg, we may have some of the headers on the reorged-to-chain, which our peers will not re-announce to us -- meaning that the direct-fetch logic wouldn't request needed missing blocks immediately.\r\n\r\nI've restructured the direct fetch logic so that if we want to download towards the latest block a peer has announced to us, then we walk back from that tip and consider every block until we find one that is on our current chain.  (We try to download every block that we don't have that is not already in-flight, and we bail out if we're walking back too many blocks.)\r\n\r\nI also realized that `sendheaders.py` had no tests for the direct fetch logic, so I updated it to exercise that part of the code as well.",
