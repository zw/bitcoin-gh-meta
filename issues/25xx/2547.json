The configuration was initialized under Windows XP, and later on transferred to a Windows 7 machine. It has worked for several months swithout any notable problems -- with the only exception of it sometimes not including a \"mined\" transaction into my free balance immediately as it matures (instead it needs to be restarted).\r\n\r\nToday, about 4 hours after receiving a \"mined\" transaction, it then crashed telling:\r\n\r\n> Assertion failed!\r\n> File: src/main.cpp\r\n> Line: 1127\r\n> Expression: pindexFirst\r\n\r\nAfter restarting, it appears to have recovered fully.",
