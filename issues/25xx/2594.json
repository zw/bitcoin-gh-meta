I therefore proceeded and made a transaction to another account to my newly created wallet. After a while though the application suddenly crashes with that message. And now when i startup the app it crashes after a few seconds with the same error message. \r\nIn the bitcoin application statusbar it says reindexing blocks on disk. \r\nAfter receiving this error i get all kinds of errors on my machine. And when i restart windows it will try to repair the disk. \r\n\r\nWhat can i do. How can i transfer the receiving address to another wallet?",
