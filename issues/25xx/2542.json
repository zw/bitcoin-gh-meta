   "body" : "After not using the application for a few months I had a backlog of blocks to catch up on and I found that there was a .7 to .8 version update. After updating, my balance went to 0 as it now had about 10+ months of blocks to catch up on and then after a power failure, it was in 'reindexing' blocks mode.\r\n\r\nIt was struggling to catch up, gaining only a few days of blocks for each day of use.\r\nI could see in the debug.log that it had up to 7 or 8 'already have block' errors for each ACCEPTED block.\r\n\r\nI left it running, reindexing and catching up, and found it had used up most of my 10gb/month ISP limit.  (took about 6 hours to reindex)\r\n\r\nUntil I found a suggestion on a forum to set maxconnections=1\r\nnow it only has 176 days of blocks to get and it gaining weeks worth of blocks each day of use...\r\n\r\nThis issue is to suggest that the program to not connect while 'reindexing' and limit connections while catching up on blocks more than x weeks ago. To prevent multiple duplicate block transmissions and perhaps a backup of a good index file?",
