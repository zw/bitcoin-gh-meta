   "body" : "Bitcoin Core fee estimation works by returning a fee rate such that the overwhelming majority (95%) of recent transactions with that fee rate were included in a block within the target number of blocks.\r\n\r\nWith a confirmation target of 1 it is often not possible to find a feerate that is high enough to meet that criteria and when it is possible it is sometimes an exorbitantly high fee rate.  Given the way Bitcoin Core's fee estimation works, the lowest target it is reasonable to estimate a feerate for is 2 blocks.  This PR avoids returning occasional absurdly high fee rates for the 1 block target by never giving an answer for that target.  This is not different from the common case in practice.\r\n\r\nestimatefee is modified to return -1 with a target of 1 always.\r\nestimatesmartfee is modified to start searching with a target of 2 if given a target of 1.\r\n\r\nThe second commit changes the GUI so targets of 1 can't be selected with the smartfee slider.  Selecting a target of 1 via config option will be equivalent to selecting a target of 2 as all internal fee estimation is done using estimatesmartfee.\r\n",
