We can decouple them from each other.\r\n\r\nThere's extra exploration in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/0.13-consensus-flags \r\nThings to explore:\r\n\r\n- Calling GetConsensusFlags from ContextualCheckBlock or \"upwards\" should look bad in benchmarks (although maybe not so much since bip9 is cached and ISM has been eliminated), but would complete GetConsensusFlags().\r\n\r\n- Moving GetConsensusFlags \"upwards\" can reduce the impact of unifying logic from both ConnectBlock and ContextualCheckBlock in GetConsensusFlags.",
