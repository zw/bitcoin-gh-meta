So in particular, block transfer times to this new node were very quick.\r\n\r\nWhat was unusual was that even though this machine fast, it was getting disconnected repeatedly during IBD for stalling (it would then get readded, since addnode'd it).  I started to look through my debug log to see what was going on, and it appears to me that it may have been something like this:\r\n\r\n- Some other peer X is stalling, gets disconnected.\r\n- Connect to some new peer Y.\r\n- X's blocks get assigned to other peers, maybe the local one.\r\n- If we're near the end of the download window, then because Y is available not downloading any blocks, the peer that was reassigned X's block has 1 second (?) to provide the block, or else that peer is stalling.\r\n\r\nSo it looked to me like I'd go through periods of time where everyone was getting disconnected for stalling, such as this particularly egregious example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:52 UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000003085d45701cef706396618d68bea4b9551b7442b031d1863 height=313019 version=0x00000002 log2_work=79.946856 tx=43453816 date='2014-07-29 15:40:42' progress=0.218633 cache\r\n=1581.8MiB(3793192tx)\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:54 Peer=290 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:56 Peer=282 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:58 Peer=291 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:06 Peer=292 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:08 Peer=286 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:11 Peer=293 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:15 Peer=294 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:17 Peer=295 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:19 Peer=296 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:21 Peer=297 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:23 Peer=298 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:28 Peer=299 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:30 Peer=300 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:32 Peer=301 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:35 Peer=302 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:37 Peer=303 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:39 Peer=304 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:41 Peer=305 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:43 Peer=306 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:45 Peer=307 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:48 Peer=309 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:51 Peer=310 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:53 Peer=311 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:55 Peer=312 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:57 Peer=313 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:59 UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000001291028bceab2639c12c762be3988017cba99fa792b460c4 height=313020 version=0x00000002 log2_work=79.946955 tx=43454953 date='2014-07-29 15:45:18' progress=0.218647 cache=1581.8MiB(3793020tx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: forgot to mention that the above snippet is from me grepping for \"stalling|UpdateTip\" in my debug.log, so the new connections that happened in between those stalling messages aren't shown.",
