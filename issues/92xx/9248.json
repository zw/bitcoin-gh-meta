   "body" : "Bitcoin 0.13.1\r\n\r\nE.g. having Tor service running on LAN IP 192.168.9.5\r\n\r\n(which ORPort is natted from the WAN router) and with Tor hidden service configuration\r\n\r\n`HiddenServicePort 8333 192.168.9.10:8333`\r\n\r\nand running bitcoind with `onlynet=tor` on another LAN host with IP 192.168.9.10, Port 8333\r\n\r\nthen on bitcoind one sees the connections all from IP 192.168.9.5 with different source ports, of course.\r\n\r\nNow I have the following in the debug log:\r\n\r\n> Misbehaving: 192.168.9.5:42853 (0 -> 200) BAN THRESHOLD EXCEEDED\r\n> connection from 192.168.9.5:42858 dropped (banned)\r\n> connection from 192.168.9.5:42860 dropped (banned)\r\n> connection from 192.168.9.5:42870 dropped (banned)\r\n> connection from 192.168.9.5:42883 dropped (banned)\r\n> connection from 192.168.9.5:42886 dropped (banned)\r\n\r\nThe IP 192.168.9.5 was blocked, and since that is the Tor hidden service IP, _all_ incoming connections are blocked.\r\n\r\nSo, I need to whitelist the IP 192.168.9.5, but then the ban function would be lost.\r\n",
