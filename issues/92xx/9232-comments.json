What I want is that once the docs or manpages are improved, noone who RTFM will end up asking what settings have to be enabled for this to work. \r\nPut another way, IMO https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=walletrbf should contain at least one Markdown or text result, but there are none. One shouldn't need to go thru C++ code to figure this out.\r\n\r\nNow, to answer your question: I enabled walletrbf as well as the other one which you didn't mention (mempoolreplacement) and restarted. First I created 2 \"same\" send tx from the same address, one with a 0 miner fee, one with a non-0 miner fee (216 bytes, 0.00015 BTC, on testnet) and then I sent them in that order using debug console. The 2nd one failed with the above mentioned error. But again, I am not looking for help on how to make this work, but for the settings to be documented somewhere (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc/man or wherever appropriate). Once it's documented, I'll read the docs and make it work. \r\n\r\n@achow101- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.13/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.12.0.md says `mempoolreplacement=0`, implying by default it is off. I know this is for v0.12, but I didn't find any updates regarding this in a later version, so unless 0 means yes here, something needs to be changed/enabled for RBF to work.... I have `mempoolreplacement=1`.",
