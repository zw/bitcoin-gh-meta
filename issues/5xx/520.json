   "body" : "This patch wraps three debug messages (```sending```, ```received``` and ```got inventory```) in ```if (fDebug) {...}```.\r\n\r\nI analyzed ```debug.log``` on a few long-running bitcoin nodes and noticed > 80% of debug.log is composed of those three messages. Thus this patch should greatly reduce debug.log size and disk I/O.\r\n\r\n* ```sending``` is triggered whenever a low-level message is sent (i.e. ```sending: inv (37 bytes)```).\r\n* ```received``` is triggered whenever a message is received (i.e. ```received: inv (37 bytes)```).\r\n* ```got inventory``` is triggered when an ``inv```-message is received.",
