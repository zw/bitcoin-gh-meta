After the coin was sent I edited the address, in my address book to keep track of the transaction, as soon as it saved - a message appeared saying Bitcoin has unexpectedly quit. I restarted the program and get the 11DbException input/output error message.\r\nI downloaded the latest version of the wallet and get the same results. The program does not open, and the same message comes up.",
