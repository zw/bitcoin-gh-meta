      "body" : "The only other thing to worry about is that someone working on client development might inadvertently run a buggy version of the client and wind up locked out of parts of the network for a few hours. I would add one other change to help prevent this. When you 'punish' an IP, check to see if you made the connection to them or they connected to you. If they connected to you, punish them for a few hours. If you connected to them, just don't connect to them for a few hours, still let them connect to you.\r\n\r\nThat way, unless you're actually malicious or make large numbers of outbound connections accidentally, you'll only get locked out for hours of a small number of peers. Someone trying to launch a DoS attack by waiting for people to connect to them will find it slow going.",
