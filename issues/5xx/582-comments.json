And I have a vague idea why signmessage\ncould be useful, but how to integrate \"secure messaging\" usefully for end\nusers without turning it into half a mail/IM client is not exactly clear\nwith me.\n\nStill I like experimental features and playing with them. Sometimes you\ndiscover novel applications just by having something available. And I don't\nwant to linger pull requests that are essentially good for too long.\n\nSo that's my reasoning to pull this and somehow make it hidden for \"normal\npayment users\", or maybe this is a good case for starting a bitcoin-next or\nUI-next branch where we can be 'innovative'?\n\nOn Thu, Oct 13, 2011 at 11:31 PM, Matt Corallo <\nreply@reply.github.com>wrote:\n\n> I would argue that putting it in the main window but without selecting any\n> tabs is worse than having it in either a new window or a tab.
