It would appear to have quite a different purpose and my concerns about it are outlined here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=46927.msg559622#msg559622\r\n\r\nIt would appear to be an incomplete solution for merged mining.  It does provide one of the operations necessary to make mm work but to my knowledge there's no complete solution based on this.  vinced's mm patches include a complete solution but the 'setworkaux' part is not exposed.  merging setworkaux with the vinced solution would seem to be best of both worlds option but since that's not what's being proposed I can't support setworkaux as a standalone patch.\r\n\r\nThe coinbaser part of this patch needs to be explained.  What output is expected from the coinbaser command?  In what format?  It's no use pulling a patch if luke is the only one that knows how to use it.",
