   "body" : "Switch to using Qt's QLocalServer/QLocalSocket to handle bitcoin payment links (bitcoin:... URIs)\r\n\r\nReason for switch: the boost::interprocess mechanism seemed flaky, and doesn't mesh as well with \"The Qt Way\".  The new code is shorter and, I think, clearer.\r\n    \r\nI made a couple of extraneous changes (alphabetized some long lists of #includes to make it easier for me to see what new includes I needed to add).\r\n\r\nI also added OSX support.\r\n\r\nSubmitting now for early review, should not be pulled until after 0.8.\r\n\r\nTest plan:\r\n\r\nOn all supported platforms:\r\n  Click on a link when Bitcoin-Qt is not running.\r\n  Click on a link when Bitcoin-Qt is already running.\r\n  Un-gracefully shutdown (kill) Bitcoin-Qt (so local socket file is left behind), then re-run.\r\n",
