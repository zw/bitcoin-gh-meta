Thus there is no software issue at our side. There's no problem with *using* UPnP when it is already available on a network.\r\n\r\nHowever, in general, with so many buggy UPnP implementations around in routers, there may be wisdom in recommending against enabling it in the router configuration. If you know what you're doing it's always safest to manually forward single ports. But this would be a documentation/wiki thing, not a software issue... \r\n\r\nSo I'm closing this issue.",
