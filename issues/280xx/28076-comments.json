I have pushed a dirty prototype (likely incomplete) for such a plugin check here: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin-tidy-experiments/commit/5c1f1e1289758df4a0407cddcfd1f8b043c53be9. It checks for declarations of std::filesystem::path, and calls to its string method. It also showcases some of the pre-processor checks that it can do. In this case, it checks if `<filesystem>` is included, and whether `std::filesystem` can be found anywhere in the source file text.\r\n\r\nThe tradeoff is obviously the readability of the code and that there might be some declaration edge cases that are not caught by them. A simple git-grep will always be a decent catch-all, but might miss certain declarations, or be unable to distinguish between comment and code. What do you think?\r\n",

Once and if this was merged, my plans were to at least remove the Bash driver, and fix the outstanding issues, e.g. to collect all failures before aborting (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28103#discussion_r1268140307).

The linters are already horrible, with some contributors having quit (at least parts of the code base) because of them. If someone pushes code and then has to wait more than 20 minutes (a full tidy CI run on 4 CPUs, 30+ minutes on a dirty ccache) to figure out they'll have to replace `std::to_string` with `ToString`, it is certainly more annoying than having to wait 30 milliseconds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time git grep 'std::to_string' > /dev/null \r\n\r\nreal\t0m0.032s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n>  rather than ad-hoc Python code calling out to git-grep, to scan for certain symbols that might appear between the brackets of an assert().\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, parsing arbitrary C++ code would be a valid reason to move the assert check to clang-tidy. However, I don't see a reason for this assert check to exist in the first place. Our assert/Assert/Assume *do* have side effects, since it is not possible to compile if they hadn't. The section in the dev notes should just be removed along with the linter. (But maybe removal or conversion of this check to clang-tidy can be discussed and done in a separate pull?)",

      "body" : "Guix is shipping rust, according to https://packages.guix.gnu.org/packages/rust-cargo, so it can be bootstrapped on all systems that can be used to compile release binaries. I am not aware of any requirement nor efforts that the linters must be as bootstrappable as the release binaries, but at least the ones in this pull are, so that alone seems sufficient. On top of that, NixOS ships rust: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/nixos-23.05/pkgs/development/compilers/rust, there is also mrustc for amd64 and gcc-rust (experimental), and maybe others that I've missed.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if there is a requirement that the linters are bootstrappable on some architectures, at a minimum it should be documented. Currently, they are literally hard-coding the requirement to `linux.x86_64`, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b565485c24c0feacae559a7f6f7b83d7516ca58d/ci/lint/04_install.sh#L45 . (This should probably be fixed either way). Also, I wonder how we want to review and check for bootstrappability of the linters. Currently they are hardcoded to (mostly) download random binary packages and executables from random places in the internet. I don't have any objection to changing that, but I presume coming up with fully bootstappable linters will be quite an effort. Also, given that the linters are downloading random binaries from random places in the internet, there is a chance that some of them already depend on rust or may even be compiled with rustc. Moreover, they may already not be bootstrappable for other reasons. When is the last time someone checked this, if at all? For example, pip packages can be wheels, which can be native binaries compiled from rust code. The same holds for any other downloaded package.\r\n\r\nFinally, the wrapper/driver code is simply calling `git grep`, meaning anyone can just directly run the `git-grep` command directly on any system that ships with `git`, with no need for bootstrapping rustc, or even compiling any lint code.",
