   "body" : "This PR adds encryption to the p2p communication after a slightly overhauled version of BIP151 defined [here](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52) (there is the plan to change BIP151 or to propose this protocol in a new BIP)\r\n\r\nThe encryption is optional and by default disabled (`-netencryption`).\r\n\r\nIf enabled, a peer connecting to another peer signalling `NODE_ENCRYPTED` (or added via `-connect=`) will try to do the proposed key handshake and continue with encrypted communication.\r\n\r\nIf enabled, peers can request (and perform) encrypted communications by sending a handshake request.\r\n\r\nPeers not supporting encryption are still accepted (no option to enforce encrypted communication).\r\n\r\nThere is a plan to make the handshake quantum resistance by adding NewHope to the key handshake (https://newhopecrypto.org). But since this PR is already very large, it's unclear wether this should be an independent patch (probably another ~600 lines of code).\r\n\r\n**Out of scope:**\r\n* optimized ChaCha20 implementation (for review and security reasons, the implementation is extracted from openssh)\r\n* benchmarks added to bench (I have done comparison against the v1 protocol with dbl-SHA256 the performance seems very similar)\r\n* Please no discussion about the used crypto scheme or the [proposal](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52) itself (better place would be the mailing list)\r\n\r\n**TODO:**\r\n* [ ] add option to `-connect=` RPC `addnode` where it is possible to specify the expected service flags (currently `-connect=` will always try for encrypted coms).",
