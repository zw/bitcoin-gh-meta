Disable this for now.\r\n- Not using `--failfast` because this is still in experimental. We should track if there is any other error.\r\n- Disable ZMQ tests because the python zmq library could cause access violation sometimes.\r\n- Disable `feature_notifications` because Bitcoin Core handles the command in different thread, whicha can cause a race condition.\r\n",
