Eventually I paid a transaction accelerator to confirm it.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n3 sat/byte is way below the typical fee currently based on a few sites I checked. This transaction basically had no chance of confirming unless the mempool went to 0. Instead it locked up the funds in a state where it is difficult to recover, requiring either paying a transaction accelerator, or attempting a double spend. The default settings for fees should never do this; the default should guarantee success with high probability. A user should have to take some action to change the settings away from default to reduce the fee to a hazardous level such as this.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\nSo far I have done two send transactions with the Bitcoin-Qt wallet. I didn't have a problem with the default fee on a different transaction, where the amount was much smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nI am running Bitcoin Core version v0.15.1 (64-bit) on OS X.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\nOS X.\r\n",
