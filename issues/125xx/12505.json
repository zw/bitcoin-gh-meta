   "body" : "After some googling, I recently ran `bitcoin-qt -zapwallettxes` on a 0.15.1 pruned multiwallet node in order to remove a stuck transaction from the transaction list, without fully understanding what I was doing. After running the command and realizing what I'd done, I was surprised to learn\r\n1. The operation succeeded without warning despite the fact I was running a multiwallet configuration\r\n2. The operation succeeded without warning even though I was running a pruned node. Meaning I now had to re-download and verify the full blockchain to get my wallets' transactions back\r\n3. The software made no wallet backups despite the destructive nature of the operation\r\n\r\nAfter some poking around in the code a bit it appears there are safeguards against 1 and 2, but they didn't trigger in this case. Maybe because my pruning and wallet options were being set via bitcoin.conf instead of the command line?\r\n\r\n<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nGeneral bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the Bitcoin StackExchange at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com.\r\n\r\nFor reporting security issues, please read instructions at https://bitcoincore.org/en/contact/.\r\n\r\nIf the node is \"stuck\" during sync or giving \"block checksum mismatch\" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the issue -->\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
