The first commit adds this feature to the core, accessed through SetNetworkActive().\r\n\r\nSecond commit adds an RPC command \"togglenetwork\" to toggle on/off.\r\n\r\nThird commit adds further connections to the gui. When the network activity is disabled the status bar and the debug window will show this. In addition the commit adds a button to the debug window to toggle network activity.\r\n\r\n![bitcoin-network-activity](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/420734/301091/75019bd4-95bd-11e2-91f2-c37c05891b31.png)\r\n\r\nOpen issues:\r\n* Should the core close the listening socket or is it enough to just disregard incoming connections by closing them immediately?\r\n* Should SetNetworkActive() return an error code or can it throw exceptions?",
