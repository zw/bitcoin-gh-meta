To me that says they're paying the fees they do to have a competitive bid for limited block space more than anything else, and are just being a bit lazy on the per-kb aspect of it.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is a short-term problem with changing MIN_TX_FEE, which is that it's used in GetMinFee(), called by CreateNewBlock(), to determine eligibility for tx inclusion in a new block. How much hashing power will accept these new fees right now?",
