   "body" : "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14565 needs test coverage. This PR refactors wallet_importmulti.py to the following pattern:\r\n\r\n1. Add `get_key()` and `get_multisig()` methods, which generate keys on node0 and return the priv/pubkeys and all scriptPubKey and address variants.\r\n2. Add `test_importmulti()` method, which takes an importmulti request, sends it to node1 and tests against success and error codes/messages.\r\n3. Add `test_address()` method, which takes an address, sends it as a getaddressinfo request to node1 and tests the values returned.\r\n\r\nThis does not add any specific testing for #14565, but makes it very straightforward to add that testing: `test_importmulti()` can be easily updated to test for returned warnings, and `test_address()` can be called multiple times against the different address variants for a singlesig/multisig.",
