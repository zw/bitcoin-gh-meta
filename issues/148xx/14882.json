I didn't check when the last common ancestor commit is.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find documentation as to why (these things just happen in open source of course), but at minimum we should make this more clear.\r\n\r\nThere's also the following line in `config.ac` that I'm not sure what to do with:\r\n```\r\nAC_INIT([univalue], [1.0.3],\r\n        [http://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/])\r\n```",
