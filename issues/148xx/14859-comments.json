Which will allow you to avoid most problems, while still allowing legitimate unconfirmed usecases.\r\n\r\nI might be wrong here, but I think fundamentally if you ever accept unconfirmed inputs you *always* need to handle the mempool acceptance errors. As you sort of fundamentally have a [TOCTTOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use) style condition, when other transactions in that \"package\" are potentially spent and your transaction which was previously acceptable is now not.\r\n\r\nThe only way around that I see is removing the whole limitdescendant(count/size) stuff in favor of pure ancestor restrictions, but that opens a bit of a bag of DoS vectors.",
