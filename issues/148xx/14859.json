To make sure it comes from another coinjoin created by me. (It's more like a convenience thing to rule out a host of possible attacks.)\r\n2. Check how many unconfirmed coinjoins there are at the moment. If larger than 24, then I don't accept any unconfirmed input to be registered.\r\n\r\nLately I encountered an issue where at coinjoin propagation I got the following error from RPC: `too-long-mempool-chain: too many descendants for tx...`.  \r\n\r\nThus I figured it would be useful if I could build a fake unsigned transaction (I do not have signature at the point when the input is registered) and test mempool acceptance for that.  \r\n\r\nI know it wouldn't replace the first sanity check I described, but it would replace my second sanity check in a future proof way.\r\n\r\nAlso I'd be happy to hear out other suggestions, too.",
