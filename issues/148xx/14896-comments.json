And the more pressing problem is that correct me if I'm wrong) the coin selection in unaware of it. So with an aggressive maxfee it will frequently create a coin selection that exceeds the `-maxtxfee`, and then in the final stage core will reject it for exceeding the `maxtxfee`.\r\n\r\nIf the coin selection itself was aware of the maxtxfee constraint, it could make a good effort at avoiding trying to create solutions that would violate it and instead say focus on larger inputs. \r\n\r\n  ",
