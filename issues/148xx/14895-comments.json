I expect that refactoring the mempool in this way to be major work and require careful review.\r\n\r\n2) Once that mempool refactor has been done, then I think we could propose a p2p protocol change (such as my above proposal, or some other more efficient or more clever proposal if anyone has a better idea).\r\n\r\nI'd love feedback on whether this path seems reasonable, or also if someone has a better idea of how to achieve the end result.",
