It also seems to be a good alternative to the observer pattern mentioned as we change far fewer things to get the same circular dependency break. So a slight code review ACK that this seems correct.\r\n\r\nSlightly short of concept ack for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Needs a simple benchmark to show that we haven't made functions calling the CTxMemPoolEntry's non-header functions slower because they are no longer within the same compilation unit\r\n2) Some other changes I've been working on lately w.r.t. epoch mempool introduce some new classes & move code between the CTxMemPool and CTxMemPoolEntry classes; while those can be rebased, it's not clear where some of the shared code should live (perhaps in a third additional header, or a new circular dependency). We already have some things which are *inherent* circular dependencies (that won't get picked up by the linter, maps of MemPoolChildren/MemPoolParents) that will deliver a big performance win to get rid of (I think it will at least), so I'd rather kill those circular dependencies first so that it doesn't become harder to do later -- I'm happy to open up a PR for that once the first step of my #17268 Project, #17925, goes through.",

In fact, it seems like background fee estimator has been planned for a while (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10199#discussion_r115530273) and implemented but unmerged at some point (#11775).",
