The balance should be correct, and if there are (reproducible) bugs related to that, they should be fixed. Exposing \"is the software behaving correctly\" RPCs shouldn't be needed if we're confident in the correctness, and adding one anyway makes it hard to reason about expectations for users (when should they turn it on?).\r\n\r\nA consistency check, as in an optionally-enabled check that always runs (like `-checkmempool` and friends) independent from RPC arguments, for debugging purposes, however seems reasonable.",
