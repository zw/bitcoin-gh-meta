Received the error message via Bitcoin Qt dialog box but no error message was written to debug.log.\r\n\r\nIt only displays the recommended password, not the actual password. It would take an unlikely chain of events for this to be exploited. The user would have to run bitcoind instead of the GUI to get the error added to the log, and then implement the recommended password. Then a user might be vulnerable after a \"email me your debug.log and I'll see if I can help\" in conjunction with being tricked into opening up RPC with rpcallowip=*, and then the attacker also finding the IP of the victim. Otherwise using this would take local access where one could just steal wallet.dat.\r\n",
