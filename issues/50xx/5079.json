Now any combination that passes IsPushOnly() is allowed, so long as the total size of the scriptPubKey is less than 42 bytes. (unchanged modulo non-minimal PUSHDATA encodings)\r\n\r\nAlso, this fixes the odd bug where previously the PUSHDATA could be replaced by any single opcode, even sigops consuming opcodes such as  CHECKMULTISIG. (20 sigops!)\r\n\r\nFinally, fix a weird corner-case bug is also fixed for TX_SCRIPTHASH outputs.",
