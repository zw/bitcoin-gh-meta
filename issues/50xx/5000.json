   "body" : "NOP1 to NOP10 are reserved for future soft-fork upgrades. In the event of an upgrade such NOPs have *VERIFY behavior, meaning that if their arguments are not correct the script fails. By blacklisting these NOPs we ensure that we'll never accept transactions, nor mine blocks, with scripts that are now invalid according to the majority of hashing power even if we're not yet upgraded. Previously this wasn't an issue as the IsStandard() rules didn't allow upgradable NOPs anyway, but 7f3b4e95 relaxed the IsStandard() rules for P2SH redemptions allowing any redeemScript to be spent.\r\n\r\nWe *do* allow upgradable NOPs in scripts so long as they are not executed. This is harmless as there is no opportunity for the script to be invalid post-upgrade.\r\n\r\nFor background on why a blacklist is needed as opposed to bumping tx version numbers to uprade opcodes see: http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg06247.html",
