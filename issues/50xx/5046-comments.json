I just used icons that were free to use (back in 0.5) sort of as placeholder, and we've kept with those all the way. Despite people being full of talk, no one ever came up with something better.\r\n\r\nIt annoys me that idle nonsense like this shares screen estate with actual crash and security issues. I think we should get rid of the GUI and wallet as soon as possible completely, if not least to get rid of this kind of stuff from the github project.\r\n",
