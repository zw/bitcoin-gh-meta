Also had two other regular nodes present on the LAN.  One slower and one faster.  I added via bitcoin-cli addnode onetry the two lan nodes to speed up testing HF.  The HF node dropped the connection to the slower LAN node.\n\nI then added the slower LAN node to the conf file with an addnode directive there.  The HF node still dropped the slower lan node.  It came back every now and then but would then be dropped soon after returning.\n\nIt would be interesting to see what it did with nodes added via -connect. \n@sipa asked me to add this issue.\n",
