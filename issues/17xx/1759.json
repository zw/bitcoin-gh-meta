Subsequent attempts to run Bitcoin result in it failing at loading the blkindex.dat file.\n5. Uninstalling/Reinstalling with either Windows or Bitcoin's uninstaller does not fix the issue.\n\nFirst time user...not exactly made confident by this initial exposure/failure.\n\nNot sure this is technically a bug, but it surely cannot be a feature.\n\nPlease assist...and thank you,\n\nBB",
