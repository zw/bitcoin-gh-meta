I don't think the difference of 1 satoshi affects how likely they are to be reclaimed nor the real-world scalability of Bitcoin given the tiny values involved. It's sort of an academic argument, the apps would get implemented even if zero-value outputs are awkward to use.\n\nMy problem with the reasoning in issue 1711 is that whilst you start with 1 satoshi being the minimum, you could use the same arguments to justify raising the minimum to 0.01 BTC or some other arbitrary value. It just doesn't seem very elegant to require a minimal sum on the output when that output is used for something other than re-allocating value.\n\nSee here for what I'm talking about: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property\n\n",

      "body" : "@mikehearn  Well the reasoning on 1711 doesn't slippery slope like that; or at least I didn't intend it to.\n\nLet me retry: The number of txouts in the txset with 1e-8 minimum txout is 2100000000000000 outputs, or about 51 bits of index. Without a limit the maximum is infinite. Perhaps its a bit academic, but it makes it possible to write design which can be shown to always work (absent a hardfork that changes things around).  (Also, arguably, bitcoin nodes don't have an incentive to actually validate against double-spend 0 value transactions because they don't risk inflation)\n\nWith a value of zero, redeeming it gains you absolutely nothing (at least in the context of the system) redeeming it if it's 1e-8 gets you something and is always rational to do so when you can do it for free (e.g. when there is space left over before the next increment). E.g. I can reasonably say that a feature that autosweeps 1e-8 dust when making transactions is clearly in the users direct best interest. I can't say that for 0.\n\nThanks for the smart property example, getting that example was why I prodded you for your input.  I don't think it changes my view at least in terms of non-standardness; though perhaps it will ultimately be a reason to not make them invalid.\n\n",
