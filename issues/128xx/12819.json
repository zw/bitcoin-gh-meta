Perhaps have a separate release-notes file for each PR that requires them, eg release-notes-pr1234.md, and then concatenate/edit them before the release? Release notes need a lot of editing anyway, so might not add too much overhead\r\n12:11 < sipa> jnewbery: that doesn't seem like more overhead than the to-wiki-and-back dance we do already at the end\r\n...\r\n13:23 < instagibbs> jnewbery, ive had to rebase a couple PRs a couple times each due to that :/\r\n13:27 < sipa> instagibbs: easy rebases, thankfully :)\r\n13:28 < instagibbs> muh acks!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm interested to hear any other suggestions for avoiding release-notes conflicts.",
