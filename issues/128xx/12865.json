   "body" : "Hello.\r\nI don't know if this the right place to put this problem.\r\nBut because it can be some bug I decided to put it in here.\r\n\r\nI will try to describe this problem in detail.\r\n\r\nI am a regular user and I have 3 full nodes running in my LAN at home.\r\nAnd this nodes were running until a while ago without any problems.\r\n\r\nI am using bitcoin 0.16.0 on all of them.\r\n\r\n I will call this machine node 1. This is my main node that is always running and it runs 24/7.\r\nThe hardware is dual core x64 with 4GB of ram. And the OS is Slackware Linux 14.2 64 bits.\r\nThis is the [`~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`]( https://pastebin.com/tLEdfjyL) on it.\r\n\r\nThis node runs without any problem. I have port 8333 forwarding on my router for this machine.\r\nI run it like this\r\n```\r\nbitcoind -daemon -disablewallet\r\n```\r\nI don't use X on that machine.\r\n\r\nMy goal with this node is to support the network and also the tor network.\r\nAt least it was the idea that I get from this guide\r\n\r\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Setting_up_a_Tor_hidden_service\r\n\r\nI am using the method 2 that says,\r\n\r\n> If you don't care about anonymity and are only looking to help the network, add the following lines to bitcoin.conf:\r\n\r\nThere is also this guide https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md\r\n\r\nIt has some things in common with the first one. But in this one there is no reference to what is in the first one as method 2.\r\n\r\nThe method 1 is very similar to the method used by Jameson Lopp in here https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-run-bitcoin-as-a-tor-hidden-service-on-ubuntu-cff52d543756\r\n\r\n\r\nNow my next machine that I will call node 2 is a i7 machine with 32GB of ram, running Slackware Linux 14.2 64 bits.\r\nI had this node running for long time because I use my armory wallet (watch only) on it.\r\nBut I tried the method 2 in https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Setting_up_a_Tor_hidden_service but as it says on\r\n\r\n>If you care about anonymity, instead of the above, add the following lines to bitcoin.conf to use Tor for everything: \r\n\r\nThis is node was this [`~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`](https://pastebin.com/u5BFG92T)\r\nI think that this problem is tor related so I tried to disable tor use on `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`\r\nAnd this node shutdowns a few seconds after I do `bitcoind -daemon -disablewallet`\r\n\r\nI changed lot of settings on the node started do shutdown to try to solve the problem.\r\nI tried to make it connect t my node 1 with `addnode`  and because it didn't work I commented it out.\r\n\r\nThen I commented out everything from the guide I followed on this setup (method 2 on the previous link).\r\nAnd tried to force the node to not use tor with `listenonion=0`\r\n\r\nThis is the [`~/.bitcoin/debug.log`](https://pastebin.com/9pruNrWh)\r\n\r\n**And now the weird part** , in this machine I have X so I can run bitcoin-qt and that work. The node start to sync and don't shutdowns. I run it at least for one hour before I disconnect it myself.\r\nI want to run this node from terminal only.\r\n\r\nAnd I have a third machine that I call node 3. And this machine is an RPi3 using an external hard drive to store the blockchain and runs Slackware ARM 14.2 current. This machine don't have X also.\r\nI also think that this machine was a tor related problem.\r\nI followed the same method and guide as node 2.\r\n\r\nThis is [`~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`](https://pastebin.com/wXUR5LVv) and [`~/.bitcoin/debug.log`](https://pastebin.com/mAyCKkfR)\r\n\r\nLike you can see it also shutdowns right away. This node intention is to only support the tor network because I run it like this `bitcoind -daemon -disablewallet`\r\n\r\nAnd it follows the initial setup of node 2.\r\n\r\nI am like this for two weeks and I don't know what to do...\r\nI tried to comment settings and not use tor but I don't get nothing. The only thing I get is to sync my node 2 using bitcoin-qt. But without that node 2 don't run.\r\n",
