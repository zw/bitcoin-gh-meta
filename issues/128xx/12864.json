Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nI find quite annoying that help rpc call returns ca 120 lines as a list of all commands. I don't remember exact form and arguments of bitcoin-cli commands so I need to re-check them quite often and always scroll in terminal.\r\nI suggest that help RPC call will be modified in the following way:\r\n  * `bitcoin-cli help` prints list of *sections*, i. e. `Blockchain`, `Control`, `Generating`, `Mining`, etc.\r\n  * `bitcoin-cli help all` prints list of all commands and sections like current `bitcoin-cli help` does\r\n  * `bitcoin-cli help <section>` prints list of commands from corresponding *section*\r\n  * `bitcoin-cli help <command>` will remain the same as in current implementation.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm willing to do that if it appears to be desirable.",
