Using `std::get` with `std::variant` is not supported on macOS until 10.14, as that is when the libc++ dylib started supporting the `std::bad_variant_access` exception. Thus this PR with `-mmacos-version-min=10.12` fails to compile:\r\n```bash\r\nwallet/rpcwallet.cpp:2969:60: error: 'get<ScriptHash, CNoDestination, PKHash, ScriptHash, WitnessV0ScriptHash, WitnessV0KeyHash, WitnessUnknown>' is unavailable: introduced in macOS 10.14\r\n                    const CScriptID& hash = CScriptID(std::get<ScriptHash>(address));\r\n                                                           ^\r\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/../include/c++/v1/variant:1376:16: note: 'get<ScriptHash, CNoDestination, PKHash, ScriptHash, WitnessV0ScriptHash, WitnessV0KeyHash, WitnessUnknown>' has been explicitly marked unavailable here\r\nconstexpr _Tp& get(variant<_Types...>& __v) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could work around this in our code using `std::get_if`, however it's still going to be a problem for 3rd-party dependencies. I've been testing compiling Qt 5.15 LTS, with `-std c++17`, and it also requires macOS 10.14+, as they using get with variant throughout cocoa code.\r\n\r\nI'll follow up some discussion in #16684.",
