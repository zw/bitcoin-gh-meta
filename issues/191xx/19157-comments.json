It makes components less reusable, and means that the introduction of code that now grabs two previously unrelated locks may result in requiring a renumbering of several locks.\n\nAs performance does not matter that much, I think you could just run a naive cycle-finding algorithm (DFS traversal, caching which nodes you've already hit) to find issues.",
