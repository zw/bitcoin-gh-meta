One percent might not sound like a big deal, but when one million gamers play the game on any given day that means 10,000 would have at least one crash bug. Our programming team could spend weeks researching the bugs for just one day at that rate!\r\n-\r\n\r\nA lot of bug hunting on something as processor and ram intensive and requiring 100% math accuracy like Bitcoin, is likely to be unrepeatable - it's going to be Bitcoin revealing to users their hardware problems. A similar hardware fitness test like the article describes, running before initial-download or during idle cpu, to certify a system's error-free crypto and 8GB of it's storage before attempting to assemble and verify a bit-accurate database, may prevent tears later.",
