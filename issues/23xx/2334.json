That's after my computer has been offline for over 12 hours, and so can't possible be true.\r\n\r\nThe \"1 minute ago\" seems to mean \"the block was generated 1 minute before it was received\", but that's not what the message says.  I don't really care how long elapsed between block generation and my client receiving it.  I care how old the block is now (because that tells me whether I'm up to date or not), and that's not what is displayed.",
