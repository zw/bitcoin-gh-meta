After clicking the X in the far right corner, windows says the program is non-responsive and asks if it should be shut down. I've tried waiting for a long time (several minutes) to see if it resolved itself, it didn't.\n\nHowever after forcing a closedown of the program through the windows close down feature, and restarting the bitcoin client, the address appears to have been imported just fine. I haven't tried to send or receive any coins with the imported adresses yet. But I assume that would work.\n\nWhen bitcoin-QT starts again, it takes a while and gives a message about verifying the block database integrity or something like that, I didn't note down exactly what it said.\n```\n\nCould the reason be that the client is rescanning ? I didn't ask it to rescan.\n",
