Take look at browsers - they stores cache history in local folder and browser settings in roaming, this is correct. An average size of roaming profile for typical user is about 100..150MB (which can be easily transferred via LAN to any user's PC), but Bitcoin's folder have 16GB wich is inappropriate.\r\nAt the same time you can think about ability to manually specify storage location, because of such a huge size. Most modern PC have SSD with quite limited capacity (64, 80, 128) for system drive and separate HDD of several TB in size. Personally I have to create Symbolic Link to store Bitcoin's storage on alternative drive.",
