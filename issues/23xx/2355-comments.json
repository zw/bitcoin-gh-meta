It should be a no-brainer to publish official backup and restore instructions, or better yet, make those instructions part of the official bitcoin clients. E.g. a message saying \"you could *lose* all of you bitcoins if you don't follow these instructions\". These instructions should say explicitly \"get this program, encrypt your file with this algorithm, and use a password like this, store the password in a vault/encrypted file that never goes online.\" etc etc.\r\n\r\nI made a related issue about change addresses making bitcoins harder to backup: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3371 . Saying \"backup frequently and often\" is NOT sufficient. Most people are really bad at backing stuff up. We see it with people's files on their computers all the time. There needs to be a solution where you only have to backup ONCE, its easy to do, its easy and reliable to restore, and its not reliant on a very specific program that could be lost in the fog of history (e.g. a very specific address generator program).
