It makes the app look cheap and \"amateurish\".\r\nif you don't believe me, take a look at the top 100 apps on the mac AppStore, and show me a single one with an icon like this...\r\nThe flat pancake looks bad, and the pointless slanting of the Bitcoin sign just annoys people (believe it or not, there was a whole 3-4 pages of thread of people hating just on the slant, and it's pointless \"lets make it look cool\" approach)....\r\nI'm not saying it has to be my design, happy for someone else to step in as well, but I am saying that if you want people to take the Mac Bitcoin client, and really the platform as a whole, more seriously, and not look like some dodgy thing cooked up by amateurs, you need professional-level graphics and artwork, and that icon is neither.",

      "body" : "I sent you a private e-mail about that, but I'll state publicly here, that I am sorry for my poor choice in words; I edited my original comments almost instantly; they do not reflect my thoughts.\r\n\r\nMaybe the best thing to do would be to make a post on the Bitcoin forums; \"Design a new icon for Bitcoin\".  Then we can al submit icons, and take a vote on what the community's favourite is.  There may surface something we can all agree to, and maybe even a bounty can be put together (i'll contribute a few bitcents...hey, I'm a poor struggling artist LOL!)...\r\nWith regards your point about the icon needing to be platform neutral, I agree...and disagree.\r\nI'll explain. \r\nA Mac style icon can (and should) be a restyling of one that is drawn to suit a windows app, likewise a linux one; they can all be the same design, but slightly restyled.  For instance, the apple Safari icon; on Mac it is as it should be, but on Windows it *should* (apple haven't done this, they won't change their icons!) be drawn in a more illustrated style; more pastels, less photoreal etc.  And on Linux, if it were drawn for that platform, it would be perhaps more cartoonish, and vivid, a la the \"Crystal/Krystal\" icon set.\r\n\r\nSince the designer has already designed the icon (which is the bulk of the work), and what not, designing a few variants is not a major issue.\r\nThe icon should be immediately recognisable as Bitcoin, but should look good at high detail (for reference, on Mac, icons now are expected to be 1024x1024...we;re a long way from 32x32, eh?), and should be re-deployable across other platforms in a slightly different style (yet still the same design etc).\r\nI would suggest we don't veer far from the \"coin\" motif, but again, if we make a forum post about this, and make it a polled \"competition\" or whatever, people are free to do what they like, and the whole community can have a say and input then...obviously this would be an icon only - we're not talking about rebranding Bitcoin itself...just making a better icon for the client app....",

I think we should require the same from any replacement icons.\r\n\r\nAlthough vector doesn't completely make the scaling issue go away, especially at the very small sizes (such as 16x16/24x24/32x32 for the notification icon) we still need a bitmap.\r\n\r\n@schildbach The problem with the launcher icon is separate; to have a high-resolution launcher icon you need to install a .desktop file in the right place, and an icon somewhere in the shared system directories. I'm not sure if the ppa does this, but the problem is not unavailability of the current icon in different sizes.",
