A professionally designed icon would be a lot better, and given many graphics designers, including myself, have contributed and released such icons for use, it seems silly not to swap to one of them away from the pancake design...even the old gold-coin design was significantly better (I understand it was dropped due to small size; larger, vector versions are available now).\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2013-02-23 at 05 52 03](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1217415/187662/2eae9dba-7d7d-11e2-9834-23da84dba84a.png)",
