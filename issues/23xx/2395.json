   "body" : "Hi all,\r\nI hadn't run my bitcoin client for ~2 years before I thought of doing it again. I downloaded the 0.8.0 client and ran it. It started wiuth >200k blocks remaining, then confirmed my coins with ~50k blocks remaining. Then somewhere around ~30k remaining it crashed with \"cannot create FB cursor\" error. I tried -rescan and -salvagewallet to no avail. I tried bringing it up, after crashing, then before it crashes again backing up the wallet and quitting, then restarting with the backup when it crashes. This got me to ~300 block remaining at one point, but never finished. Then the fork problem surfaced and I had to stop. After it was resolved I tried it again, but this time I never got beyond ~40k blocks remaining.\r\n\r\nI've searched around but haven't found anyone with the same problem -- db cursor problem happens but they don't seem to be the same cause. \r\n\r\nYour kind help would be very much appreciated!",
