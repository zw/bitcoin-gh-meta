If so I think it makes sense to make that clear (via an assertion) since the code here appears to be working under that assumption. It will have the added benefit of silencing this NULL pointer dereference warning for static analysis tools that don't pick up this subtle state change limitation (if such a limitation exists).\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting this @pavlosantoniou. You beat me to reporting it! :-) I had this in my backlog of possible NULL pointer dereferences to report, but as I try to limit the number of open PR:s pertaining to the same class of issues I figured I'd await the merge of a similar issue I reported in #9549:\r\n> [[net] Avoid possibility of NULL pointer dereference in MarkBlockAsInFlight(...)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9549)",

That is a reasonable thing to do which we do elsewhere.  But could PRs like this please get titles like \"Add a null guard in function X\" unless we strongly suspect there was a real issue?

      "body" : "@sipa Agree about the wording!\r\n\r\n@laanwj I think the reason for the static analyzer warning in this case (and other cases reported as \"possible null pointer dereference\") is that a `NULL` check is performed earlier in the code which would imply that the variable can be `NULL` (not necessarily in practice, but in the reasoning of the analyzer). A dereference takes place later in the code where no `NULL` check exists and the static analyzer then concludes that there is a possibility of a `NULL` pointer dereference.\r\n\r\nMore specifically in this case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (fPruneMode)\r\n    {\r\n        CBlockIndex *block = chainActive.Tip();\r\n        while (block && block->pprev && (block->pprev->nStatus & BLOCK_HAVE_DATA))\r\n            block = block->pprev;\r\n\r\n        obj.push_back(Pair(\"pruneheight\",        block->nHeight));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case:\r\n1. `while (block && Ã¢ÂÂ¦)` implies that `block` can theoretically be `NULL`.\r\n2. `block->nHeight` - dereference without checking for `NULL`. Warning!\r\n\r\nBoth `clang-tidy` and `cppcheck` follow that line of reasoning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# clang-tidy\r\nrpc/blockchain.cpp:1199:50: warning: Access to field 'nHeight' results in a dereference of a null pointer (loaded from variable 'block') [clang-analyzer-core.NullDereference]\r\n\r\n# cppcheck\r\n[src/rpc/blockchain.cpp:1199] -> [src/rpc/blockchain.cpp:1196]: (warning) Either the condition 'block' is redundant or there is possible null pointer dereference: block.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if we're sure that `chainActive.Tip()` cannot be `NULL` in this context the warning can be avoided by removing the `NULL`-check in the `while`-loop, or adding a `assert` before the dereference.\r\n\r\n(In addition to adding a a `NULL`-check before the dereference of course :-))\r\n\r\nPerhaps removing the `NULL`-check in the `while`-loop and maybe adding an `assert` before the `while` loop is the best way to go if we are sure that `chainActive.Tip()` cannot be `NULL` in this context. That removes the redundant check and documents the assumption made when doing said removal.\r\n\r\nThis will silence the `clang-tidy` and `cppcheck` warnings:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp b/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp\r\nindex d65e107..1915a45 100644\r\n--- a/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp\r\n@@ -1193,7 +1193,8 @@ UniValue getblockchaininfo(const JSONRPCRequest& request)\r\n     if (fPruneMode)\r\n     {\r\n         CBlockIndex *block = chainActive.Tip();\r\n-        while (block && block->pprev && (block->pprev->nStatus & BLOCK_HAVE_DATA))\r\n+        assert(block && \"chainActive.Tip() != nullptr assumed\");\r\n+        while (block->pprev && (block->pprev->nStatus & BLOCK_HAVE_DATA))\r\n             block = block->pprev;\r\n\r\n         obj.push_back(Pair(\"pruneheight\",        block->nHeight));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `assert(Ã¢ÂÂ¦)` is technically not needed to get rid of the analyzer warnings.",
