      "body" : "> I'm not sure if we should call it wallet_name on the RPC layer\r\n\r\nYes, good point to bring up. I see there was some discussion of this here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10650#issuecomment-310606962 . My personal opinion is that wallet name should always equal filename to avoid confusion, but I'm happy to discuss if other people have different ideas. Perhaps one to bring up in tomorrow's meeting?",
