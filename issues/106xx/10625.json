Probably only when conservative = true.  Perhaps a history as long as 4 weeks?  \r\nMaybe we could just keep a rolling history of the max per day for each day over the last 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty easy change to make, just wanted to make a note, because I think it would be a good improvement to get in before 0.15.\r\n\r\n",
