However it immediately found the funds (which had 4 confirmations), despite rescan set to false. My expectation was that it would only find funds for future transactions. Looking at the source code I can't see how this would happen and how many blocks it actually does scan back.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the current behavior is intended or not, but it could be made a lot more clear",
