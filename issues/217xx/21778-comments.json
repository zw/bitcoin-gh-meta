But it's great to see that linking finally works!\r\n\r\nFor a little extra context beyond what @fanquake said above, the macOS clang+cctools build has always been a wonky outlier because we have to build our own (very unsupported) toolchain first. LD64 is apple's libre/open-source linker, and there is a community project that maintains a [build environment for cross builds](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/cctools-port).\r\n\r\nFor a few years, there has been slow development on a darwin functionality for llvm's lld, but it's only really picked up speed and become usable in the last year or two. This PR would bring our Apple builds much more inline with others in that it would finally be using a supported libre/open-source compiler/linker combo.\r\n\r\n@fanquake Is cctools still needed at all?

It has been replaced by `-fixup_chains` [as of ld64 v512.4](https://github.com/apple-opensource/ld64/commit/03dfd5524c89ea8e1d3a01c8a487934fb5433514). Here's a [write-up on the new functionality](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/iOS15LaunchTime). For lld (in conflict with what the site above says), the new functionality kicks in when [`OSX_MIN_VERSION` >= 11.0](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/16.x/lld/MachO/Driver.cpp#L1021).\r\n\r\n> - Fix building libbitcoinconsensus.\r\n\r\nBy this, I believe you mean unsupported `lld -r`? If so, that should be unnecessary with CMake.\r\n\r\nEdit: Core is a beast to test with, but using libsecp256k1 as a test-case:\r\nPlaying around with the link options: `-Wl,-no_fixup_chains -Wl,-bind-at-load` (and their opposites) do as expected as checked with: `objdump -t --lazy-bind libsecp256k1.2.dylib`. When using `-fixup_chains` (the new default for >=11.0) the lazy bind table is empty as we'd hope.",
