   "body" : "What if, right along side miner fees, there was a way to donate to P2P Pool to encourage more nodes and decentralized mining?  \r\n\r\nThis donation would always be paid to P2P Pool no matter which pool won the block.  Maybe these fees can be held in a multsig address and release to P2P Pool once they win and the donations are distributed the same way the reward is distributed today.   Who would control this address?   Bitcoin Foundation?  MIT? \r\n\r\nThe donation amount could be a percentage or fixed amount.\r\n\r\nThis sort of functionality could be expanded further to include charities, non-profits, and other causes you wish to support.",
