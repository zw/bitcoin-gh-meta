At 1cent/KB we'd be looking at $16k/year of tx fees avoided due to priority.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, if we screw this we just need to lose 2.2 blocks to wipe out all these savings, which comes out of miners' pockets anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm with @jgarzik here: better to remove priority and simplify the codebase, particularly when other than Bitcoin Core nearly no wallets use it anyway. (Electrum is apparently an exception)\r\n\r\nIt's also notable how this patch will make \"priority camping\" easier: broadcast a broadcast a lowish priority tx, and wait until it gets confirmed, over and over again to waste priority on useless txs. I've seen people do this before when we had that bug where the same tx would be included multiple times; I don't doubt it'll happen again.",
