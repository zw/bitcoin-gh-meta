   "body" : "Removes a network attacker node's ability to indefinitely blind its peers to a block or transaction new to them, such as a double-spend generated by attacker.  The possible blinding interval is reduced to the getdata timeout (currently 2 minutes).\n\nThis vulnerability is discussed in [Tampering with the Delivery of Blocks and Transactions in Bitcoin [1]](http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/578) and was described earlier in [Discovering BitcoinÃ¢ÂÂs Public Topology and Influential Nodes [2]](http://cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/coinscope.pdf).\n\nThis is a lighter implementation of #4547.  Attention is paid to the result of the insert into the existing collection setInventoryKnown, rather than introducing a new collection.\n#4547 was closed to focus on a wider solution that has been delayed.\n",
