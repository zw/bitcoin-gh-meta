Stick with 1.0 for know, use 1.1 with the next release and perhaps 1.2 with the next major release or something like that? It should of course be mentioned in the release notes and it should be looked at BIP70, if there is a definition that prevents using highest encryption levels.\r\n\r\nAlso I remember a discussion about removing SSL support for rpc, what was the reason to not do that or is it just not removed?\r\n\r\nEdit: I'd also like to ping you as I know I've got 2 open payment request related pulls ^^.
