I tend to agree with @practicalswift though that probably the memory saving benefit doesn't outweigh the reduced code readability, at least not in the current form when the user part of the data structure suddenly has to take care of maintaining additional internal state that should not be exposed.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to generalize the concept by creating a new container that inherits from `std::forward_list` and adds the missing parts (tail pointer, push method)? Not sure If its worth it but from a general perspective I would prefer it to the current approach.\r\n\r\nAnother question, from the perspective of an STL noob: If we want to store a message queue, why we didn't simply choose std::queue? Is it because of the .splice() magic that wouldn't be possible then?",
