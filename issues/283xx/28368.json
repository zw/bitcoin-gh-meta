   "body" : "This is an attempt to  #11775 \r\n\r\nThis Pr will enable fee estimator to listen to ValidationInterface notifications to process new transactions added and removed from the mempool.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Added a new callback to the Validation Interface `MempoolTransactionsRemovedForConnectedBlock`, which notifies listeners about the transactions that have been removed due to a new block being connected, along with the height at which the transactions were removed.\r\n- Modified the `TransactionAddedToMempool` callback parameter to include additional information about the transaction needed for fee estimation.\r\n- Updated `CBlockPolicyEstimator` to process transactions using` CTransactionRef` instead of `CTxMempoolEntry.`\r\n- Implemented the `CValidationInterface` interface in `CBlockPolicyEstimater` and overridden the `TransactionAddedToMempool`, `TransactionRemovedFromMempool`, and `MempoolTransactionsRemovedForConnectedBlock` methods to receive updates from their notifications.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the fee estimator updates from the mempool, i.e whenever a new block is connected all transactions in the block that are in our mempool are going to be removed using the `removeForBlock` function in `txmempool.cpp`. \r\n\r\nThis removal triggered updates to the fee estimator. As a result, the fee estimator would block mempool's `cs` until it finished updating every time a new block was connected.\r\nInstead of being blocked only on mempool tx removal, we were blocking on both tx removal and fee estimator updating.\r\nIf we want to further improve fee estimation, or add heavy-calulation steps to it, it is currently not viable as we would be slowing down block relay in the process\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller in terms of the changes made compared to #11775, as it focuses solely on enabling fee estimator updates from the validationInterface/cscheduler thread notifications.\r\n\r\nI have not split the validation interface because, as I understand it, the rationale behind the split in #11775 was to have `MempoolInterface` signals come from the mempool and `CValidationInterface` events come from validation. I believe this separation can be achieved in a separate refactoring PR when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAlso left out some commits from #11775\r\n- Some refactoring which are no longer needed.\r\n- Handle reorgs much better in fee estimator. \r\n- Track witness hash malleation in fee estimator \r\n\r\nI believe they are a separate change that can come in a follow-up after this.\r\n\r\n",
