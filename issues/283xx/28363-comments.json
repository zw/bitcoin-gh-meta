This tutorial will guide you through the process of securely signing Bitcoin transactions using an offline wallet and an online watch-only wallet.\n+\n+## Overview\n+In this tutorial, we have two hosts: [offline] which is totally offline and without a copy of the blockchain and [online] which is a regular online node, both running Bitcoin 25.0\n+\n+In this example, we are going to generate a key on the offline wallet, and then send it 0.0009 BTC with an online(sending) wallet, then using the online wallet draft a transaction to send 0.0008 BTC to another online(receiving) wallet, then sign that with the offline wallet, and finally announce the signed transaction into the network using the online wallet.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Tested using Signet with a connected host machine and an offline docker container (representing the offline wallet) both running Signet, should also work with Regtest and Mainnet\n+\n+\n+## Step 1: Sending money to the offline wallet\n+\n+### Create and Load Funds into the Online Sending Wallet\n+\n+1.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of securely signing Bitcoin transactions using an offline wallet and an online watch-only wallet.\n+\n+## Overview\n+In this tutorial, we have two hosts: [offline] which is totally offline and without a copy of the blockchain and [online] which is a regular online node, both running Bitcoin 25.0\n+\n+In this example, we are going to generate a key on the offline wallet, and then send it 0.0009 BTC with an online(sending) wallet, then using the online wallet draft a transaction to send 0.0008 BTC to another online(receiving) wallet, then sign that with the offline wallet, and finally announce the signed transaction into the network using the online wallet.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Tested using Signet with a connected host machine and an offline docker container (representing the offline wallet) both running Signet, should also work with Regtest and Mainnet\n+\n+\n+## Step 1: Sending money to the offline wallet\n+\n+### Create and Load Funds into the Online Sending Wallet\n+\n+1. On the online machine, create an online wallet named `online_sending_wallet` and load funds into it.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"online_sending_wallet\"\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"online_sending_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of securely signing Bitcoin transactions using an offline wallet and an online watch-only wallet.\n+\n+## Overview\n+In this tutorial, we have two hosts: [offline] which is totally offline and without a copy of the blockchain and [online] which is a regular online node, both running Bitcoin 25.0\n+\n+In this example, we are going to generate a key on the offline wallet, and then send it 0.0009 BTC with an online(sending) wallet, then using the online wallet draft a transaction to send 0.0008 BTC to another online(receiving) wallet, then sign that with the offline wallet, and finally announce the signed transaction into the network using the online wallet.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Tested using Signet with a connected host machine and an offline docker container (representing the offline wallet) both running Signet, should also work with Regtest and Mainnet\n+\n+\n+## Step 1: Sending money to the offline wallet\n+\n+### Create and Load Funds into the Online Sending Wallet\n+\n+1. On the online machine, create an online wallet named `online_sending_wallet` and load funds into it.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"online_sending_wallet\"\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"online_sending_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of securely signing Bitcoin transactions using an offline wallet and an online watch-only wallet.\n+\n+## Overview\n+In this tutorial, we have two hosts: [offline] which is totally offline and without a copy of the blockchain and [online] which is a regular online node, both running Bitcoin 25.0\n+\n+In this example, we are going to create an `offline_wallet` on the [offline] host. We will then create a `watch_only_wallet` on the [online] host using descriptors imported from the `offline_wallet` and load funds to the wallet. we'll create a PSBT transaction using the  `watch_only_wallet`, sign it with the `offline_wallet` then broadcast the transaction using the [online] host\n+\n+### Requirements\n+- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installation - This tutorial uses jq to process JSON.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Tested using Signet with a connected host machine and an offline docker container (representing the offline wallet) both running Signet, should also work with Regtest and Mainnet\n+\n+### Create and Prepare the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+1.

On the online machine, create an online watch-only wallet named `watch_only_wallet` without private keys (disable_private_keys=true) and should be blank with no keys or HD seed (blank=true).\n+- The `watch_only_wallet` wallet will be used to track transactions received to the `offline_wallet` and for creating PSBT transactions.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"watch_only_wallet\" disable_private_keys=true blank=true\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"watch_only_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of securely signing Bitcoin transactions using an offline wallet and an online watch-only wallet.\n+\n+## Overview\n+In this tutorial, we have two hosts: [offline] which is totally offline and without a copy of the blockchain and [online] which is a regular online node, both running Bitcoin 25.0\n+\n+In this example, we are going to create an `offline_wallet` on the [offline] host. We will then create a `watch_only_wallet` on the [online] host using descriptors imported from the `offline_wallet` and load funds to the wallet. we'll create a PSBT transaction using the  `watch_only_wallet`, sign it with the `offline_wallet` then broadcast the transaction using the [online] host\n+\n+### Requirements\n+- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installation - This tutorial uses jq to process JSON.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Tested using Signet with a connected host machine and an offline docker container (representing the offline wallet) both running Signet, should also work with Regtest and Mainnet\n+\n+### Create and Prepare the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+1.

(This is an easier way to export the descriptors compared to manual export)\n+\n+### Create the online `watch_only_wallet`\n+\n+1. On the online machine, create an online watch-only wallet named `watch_only_wallet` without private keys (disable_private_keys=true) and should be blank with no keys or HD seed (blank=true).\n+- The `watch_only_wallet` wallet will be used to track transactions received to the `offline_wallet` and for creating PSBT transactions.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"watch_only_wallet\" disable_private_keys=true blank=true\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"watch_only_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2.

As a result, they generate the same addresses and have access to the same \"funds.\" However, to spend these funds, cooperation between both wallets is required since you need the private keys to sign the transactions which are only available on the `offline_wallet`.\n+\n+1. Generate an address for the `offline_wallet` to load funds. You can use either the `offline_wallet` or the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate this address, as they will produce the same address. For the sake of this guide, we'll use the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate the address, which can then be shared with others online.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" getnewaddress\n+tb1qtu5qgc6ddhmqm5yqjvhg83qgk2t4ewajg0h6yh\n+```\n+\n+2. Visit a faucet like https://signet.bc-2.jp to load funds into the generated address.\n+\n+3. Confirm the received funds (to the `offline_wallet`) using the online `watch_only_wallet`.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of securely signing Bitcoin transactions using an offline wallet and an online watch-only wallet.\n+\n+## Overview\n+In this tutorial, we have two hosts: [offline] which is totally offline and without a copy of the blockchain and [online] which is a regular online node, both running Bitcoin 25.0\n+\n+In this example, we are going to create an `offline_wallet` on the [offline] host. We will then create a `watch_only_wallet` on the [online] host using descriptors imported from the `offline_wallet` and load funds to the wallet. we'll create a PSBT transaction using the  `watch_only_wallet`, sign it with the `offline_wallet` then broadcast the transaction using the [online] host\n+\n+### Requirements\n+- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installation - This tutorial uses jq to process JSON.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Tested using Signet with a connected host machine and an offline docker container (representing the offline wallet) both running Signet, should also work with Regtest and Mainnet\n+\n+### Create and Prepare the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+1.

So feel free to take what you like from both of them if you agree that the suggestions are useful.",

We will then create a `watch_only_wallet` on the [online] host using public key descriptors exported from the `offline_wallet`. Next we will receive some coins into the wallet. In order to spend these coins we'll create an unsigned PSBT using the `watch_only_wallet`, sign the PSBT using the private keys in the `offline_wallet`, and finally broadcast the signed PSBT using the [online] host.\n+\n+### Requirements\n+- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installation - This tutorial uses jq to process certain fields from JSON RPC responses, but this convenience is optional.\n+\n+### Create and Prepare the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+1. On the offline machine create a wallet named `offline_wallet`. This wallet will contain private keys and must remain unconnected to any networks at all times.\n+\n+```sh\n+[offline]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"offline_wallet\"\n+\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"offline_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2. Export the public key-only descriptors from [offline] to a JSON file named `descriptors.json`. We use `jq` here to extract the `.descriptors` field from the full RPC response.\n+\n+```sh\n+[offline]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"offline_wallet\" listdescriptors \\\n+             | jq -r '.descriptors' \\\n+             >> /path/to/descriptors.json\n+```\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> The `descriptors.json` file will be transferred to the online machine (e.g. using a USB flash drive) where it can be imported to create a related watch-only wallet.\n+\n+### Create the online `watch_only_wallet`\n+\n+1. On the online machine create a blank watch-only wallet which has private keys disabled and is named `watch_only_wallet`. This is achieved by using the `createwallet` options: `disable_private_keys=true, blank=true`.\n+\n+The `watch_only_wallet` wallet will be used to track and validate incoming transactions, for creating unsigned PSBTs when spending coins, and for broadcasting signed and finalised PSBTs.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> `blank` indicates that the wallet should not generate any new keys of its own. `disable_private_keys` indicates that the wallet should refuse to import private keys, i.e. will be a dedicated watch-only wallet.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet \\\n+              wallet_name=\"watch_only_wallet\" \\\n+              disable_private_keys=true \\\n+              blank=true\n+\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"watch_only_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2. Import the `offline_wallet`s public key descriptors to the online `watch_only_wallet` using the `descriptors.json` file created on the offline wallet.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" importdescriptors \"$(cat /path/to/descriptors.json)\"\n+\n+[\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  }\n+]\n+```\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Multiple success values show indicates that multiple descriptors, for different address types, have been successfully imported. This allows generating different address types on the `watch_only_wallet`.\n+\n+### Fund the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+At this point it's important to understand that both the `offline_wallet` and [online] `watch_only_wallet` share the same public keys. As a result they generate the same addresses. Transactions can be constructed using either wallet, but valid signatures can only be added by the `offline_wallet` as only it has the private keys.\n+\n+1. Generate an address to receive coins to. You can use _either_ the `offline_wallet` or the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate this address, as they will produce the same addresses. For the sake of this guide we'll use the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate the address.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" getnewaddress\n+\n+tb1qtu5qgc6ddhmqm5yqjvhg83qgk2t4ewajg0h6yh\n+```\n+\n+2. Visit a faucet like https://signet.bc-2.jp and enter your address from the previous command to receive a small amount of signet coins to this address.\n+\n+3. Confirm that coins were received using the online `watch_only_wallet`. Note that the transaction may take a few moments before being received on your local node, depending on its connectivity. Just re-run the command periodically until the transaction is received.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" listunspent\n+\n+[\n+  {\n+    \"txid\": \"0f3953dfc3eb8e753cd1633151837c5b9953992914ff32b7de08c47f1f29c762\",\n+    \"vout\": 1,\n+    \"address\": \"tb1qtu5qgc6ddhmqm5yqjvhg83qgk2t4ewajg0h6yh\",\n+    \"label\": \"\",\n+    \"scriptPubKey\": \"00145f2804634d6df60dd080932e83c408b2975cbbb2\",\n+    \"amount\": 0.01000000,\n+    \"confirmations\": 4,\n+    \"spendable\": true,\n+    \"solvable\": true,\n+    \"desc\": \"wpkh([306c734f/84h/1h/0h/0/0]025932ccee7590158f7e08bb36290d135d30a0b045163da896e1cd7645ec4223a9)#xytvyr4a\",\n+    \"parent_descs\": [\n+      \"wpkh([306c734f/84h/1h/0h]tpubDCJnY92ib4Zu3qd6wrBXEjG436tQdA2tDiJU2iSJYjkNS1darssPWKaBfojhjUF5vMLBcxbN2r93pmFMz2zyTEZuNx9JDo9rWqoHhATW3Uz/0/*)#7mh08dkg\"\n+    ],\n+    \"safe\": true\n+  }\n+]\n+```\n+\n+### Create and Export an Unsigned PSBT\n+\n+1. Get a destination address for the transaction. In this tutorial we'll be sending funds to the address `tb1q9k5w0nhnhyeh78snpxh0t5t7c3lxdeg3erez32`, but if you don't need the coins for further testing you could send the coins back to the faucet.\n+\n+2. Create a funded but unsigned PSBT to the destination address with the [online] `watch_only_wallet` by using `walletcreatefundedpsbt inputs[], outputs[address: amount]` and export the unsigned PSBT to a file `funded_psbt.txt` for easy portability to the `offline_wallet` for signing:\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" walletcreatefundedpsbt \\\n+              '[]' '[{\"tb1q9k5w0nhnhyeh78snpxh0t5t7c3lxdeg3erez32\": 0.009}]' \\\n+              | jq -r '.psbt' \\\n+              >> /path/to/funded_psbt.txt\n+\n+[online]$ cat /path/to/funded_psbt.txt\n+\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\n+```\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Leaving the `input` array empty in the above `walletcreatefundedpsbt` command is permitted and will cause the wallet to automatically select appropriate inputs for the transaction.\n+\n+### Decode and Analyze the Unsigned PSBT\n+\n+Decode and analyze the unsigned PSBT on the `offline_wallet` using the `funded_psbt.txt` file:",

We will then create a `watch_only_wallet` on the [online] host using public key descriptors exported from the `offline_wallet`. Next we will receive some coins into the wallet. In order to spend these coins we'll create an unsigned PSBT using the `watch_only_wallet`, sign the PSBT using the private keys in the `offline_wallet`, and finally broadcast the signed PSBT using the [online] host.\n+\n+### Requirements\n+- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installation - This tutorial uses jq to process certain fields from JSON RPC responses, but this convenience is optional.\n+\n+### Create and Prepare the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+1.

We will then create a `watch_only_wallet` on the [online] host using public key descriptors exported from the `offline_wallet`. Next we will receive some coins into the wallet. In order to spend these coins we'll create an unsigned PSBT using the `watch_only_wallet`, sign the PSBT using the private keys in the `offline_wallet`, and finally broadcast the signed PSBT using the [online] host.\n+\n+### Requirements\n+- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installation - This tutorial uses jq to process certain fields from JSON RPC responses, but this convenience is optional.\n+\n+### Create and Prepare the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+1. On the offline machine create a wallet named `offline_wallet`. This wallet will contain private keys and must remain unconnected to any networks at all times.\n+\n+```sh\n+[offline]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"offline_wallet\"\n+\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"offline_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2. Export the public key-only descriptors from [offline] to a JSON file named `descriptors.json`. We use `jq` here to extract the `.descriptors` field from the full RPC response.\n+\n+```sh\n+[offline]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"offline_wallet\" listdescriptors \\\n+             | jq -r '.descriptors' \\\n+             >> /path/to/descriptors.json\n+```\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> The `descriptors.json` file will be transferred to the online machine (e.g. using a USB flash drive) where it can be imported to create a related watch-only wallet.\n+\n+### Create the online `watch_only_wallet`\n+\n+1. On the online machine create a blank watch-only wallet which has private keys disabled and is named `watch_only_wallet`. This is achieved by using the `createwallet` options: `disable_private_keys=true, blank=true`.\n+\n+The `watch_only_wallet` wallet will be used to track and validate incoming transactions, for creating unsigned PSBTs when spending coins, and for broadcasting signed and finalised PSBTs.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> `blank` indicates that the wallet should not generate any new keys of its own. `disable_private_keys` indicates that the wallet should refuse to import private keys, i.e. will be a dedicated watch-only wallet.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet \\\n+              wallet_name=\"watch_only_wallet\" \\\n+              disable_private_keys=true \\\n+              blank=true\n+\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"watch_only_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2. Import the `offline_wallet`s public key descriptors to the online `watch_only_wallet` using the `descriptors.json` file created on the offline wallet.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" importdescriptors \"$(cat /path/to/descriptors.json)\"\n+\n+[\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  }\n+]\n+```\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Multiple success values show indicates that multiple descriptors, for different address types, have been successfully imported. This allows generating different address types on the `watch_only_wallet`.\n+\n+### Fund the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+At this point it's important to understand that both the `offline_wallet` and [online] `watch_only_wallet` share the same public keys. As a result they generate the same addresses. Transactions can be constructed using either wallet, but valid signatures can only be added by the `offline_wallet` as only it has the private keys.\n+\n+1. Generate an address to receive coins to. You can use _either_ the `offline_wallet` or the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate this address, as they will produce the same addresses. For the sake of this guide we'll use the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate the address.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" getnewaddress\n+\n+tb1qtu5qgc6ddhmqm5yqjvhg83qgk2t4ewajg0h6yh\n+```\n+\n+2.

We will then create a `watch_only_wallet` on the [online] host using public key descriptors exported from the `offline_wallet`. Next we will receive some coins into the wallet. In order to spend these coins we'll create an unsigned PSBT using the `watch_only_wallet`, sign the PSBT using the private keys in the `offline_wallet`, and finally broadcast the signed PSBT using the [online] host.\n+\n+### Requirements\n+- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installation - This tutorial uses jq to process certain fields from JSON RPC responses, but this convenience is optional.\n+\n+### Create and Prepare the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+1. On the offline machine create a wallet named `offline_wallet`. This wallet will contain private keys and must remain unconnected to any networks at all times.\n+\n+```sh\n+[offline]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet wallet_name=\"offline_wallet\"\n+\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"offline_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2. Export the public key-only descriptors from [offline] to a JSON file named `descriptors.json`. We use `jq` here to extract the `.descriptors` field from the full RPC response.\n+\n+```sh\n+[offline]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"offline_wallet\" listdescriptors \\\n+             | jq -r '.descriptors' \\\n+             >> /path/to/descriptors.json\n+```\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> The `descriptors.json` file will be transferred to the online machine (e.g. using a USB flash drive) where it can be imported to create a related watch-only wallet.\n+\n+### Create the online `watch_only_wallet`\n+\n+1. On the online machine create a blank watch-only wallet which has private keys disabled and is named `watch_only_wallet`. This is achieved by using the `createwallet` options: `disable_private_keys=true, blank=true`.\n+\n+The `watch_only_wallet` wallet will be used to track and validate incoming transactions, for creating unsigned PSBTs when spending coins, and for broadcasting signed and finalised PSBTs.\n+\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> `blank` indicates that the wallet should not generate any new keys of its own. `disable_private_keys` indicates that the wallet should refuse to import private keys, i.e. will be a dedicated watch-only wallet.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -named createwallet \\\n+              wallet_name=\"watch_only_wallet\" \\\n+              disable_private_keys=true \\\n+              blank=true\n+\n+{\n+  \"name\": \"watch_only_wallet\"\n+}\n+```\n+\n+2. Import the `offline_wallet`s public key descriptors to the online `watch_only_wallet` using the `descriptors.json` file created on the offline wallet.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" importdescriptors \"$(cat /path/to/descriptors.json)\"\n+\n+[\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  },\n+  {\n+    \"success\": true\n+  }\n+]\n+```\n+> [!NOTE]\n+> Multiple success values show indicates that multiple descriptors, for different address types, have been successfully imported. This allows generating different address types on the `watch_only_wallet`.\n+\n+### Fund the `offline_wallet`\n+\n+At this point it's important to understand that both the `offline_wallet` and [online] `watch_only_wallet` share the same public keys. As a result they generate the same addresses. Transactions can be constructed using either wallet, but valid signatures can only be added by the `offline_wallet` as only it has the private keys.\n+\n+1. Generate an address to receive coins to. You can use _either_ the `offline_wallet` or the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate this address, as they will produce the same addresses. For the sake of this guide we'll use the [online] `watch_only_wallet` to generate the address.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" getnewaddress\n+\n+tb1qtu5qgc6ddhmqm5yqjvhg83qgk2t4ewajg0h6yh\n+```\n+\n+2. Visit a faucet like https://signet.bc-2.jp and enter your address from the previous command to receive a small amount of signet coins to this address.\n+\n+3. Confirm that coins were received using the online `watch_only_wallet`. Note that the transaction may take a few moments before being received on your local node, depending on its connectivity. Just re-run the command periodically until the transaction is received.\n+\n+```sh\n+[online]$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=\"watch_only_wallet\" listunspent\n+\n+[\n+  {\n+    \"txid\": \"0f3953dfc3eb8e753cd1633151837c5b9953992914ff32b7de08c47f1f29c762\",\n+    \"vout\": 1,\n+    \"address\": \"tb1qtu5qgc6ddhmqm5yqjvhg83qgk2t4ewajg0h6yh\",\n+    \"label\": \"\",\n+    \"scriptPubKey\": \"00145f2804634d6df60dd080932e83c408b2975cbbb2\",\n+    \"amount\": 0.01000000,\n+    \"confirmations\": 4,\n+    \"spendable\": true,\n+    \"solvable\": true,\n+    \"desc\": \"wpkh([306c734f/84h/1h/0h/0/0]025932ccee7590158f7e08bb36290d135d30a0b045163da896e1cd7645ec4223a9)#xytvyr4a\",\n+    \"parent_descs\": [\n+      \"wpkh([306c734f/84h/1h/0h]tpubDCJnY92ib4Zu3qd6wrBXEjG436tQdA2tDiJU2iSJYjkNS1darssPWKaBfojhjUF5vMLBcxbN2r93pmFMz2zyTEZuNx9JDo9rWqoHhATW3Uz/0/*)#7mh08dkg\"\n+    ],\n+    \"safe\": true\n+  }\n+]\n+```\n+\n+### Create and Export an Unsigned PSBT\n+\n+1.
