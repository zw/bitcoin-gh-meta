This can easily lead to OOM, as you explain, in which case the user would have to start from zero, because potentially nothing has been persisted at all. Also, for slow storage it could lead to hangs, which could lead the user (or OS) to kill the process, causing the same issues. Finally, with assumeutxo, I wonder why there is any need to chase this? No objection to this pull, but I wonder if this really makes users happier *on average*, or will just lead to more hangs, crashes and `-reindex`.",

We should not quietly change a user setting, so imo an invalid value should explicitly fail, rather than silently fail.\r\n\r\n> Also, CI still fails\r\n\r\nIndeed. I copied the `is_64bits = sys.maxsize > 2**32` check from `netutil.py`, but it seems the check doesn't actually work. So there might be a bug in `netutil.py`.\r\n\r\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/5137529851084800?logs=ci#L10796\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the `multiprocess, i686` CI compiler seems to think it's 32 bit (while the test framework thinks it's 64 bit), so the `sizeof(void*)` check in `txdb.h` seems broken too. (which could be another reason to just drop the limit entirely)\r\n\r\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/4715317386018816?logs=ci#L3814",

      "body" : "> If we are worried about someone using an inappropriate value we can try to solve that separately (maybe by testing that we can allocate that much at startup or something?).\r\n\r\nThe best would be never setting it greater than total RAM. `-dbcache=<total RAM>` is still higher than optimal as there will be applications in memory that won't be swapped to disk including Bitcoin. But measuring Available RAM or swap is precarious as it changes.\r\n\r\nSince other reviewers mentioned only wildly excessive values are seriously detrimental with swap, capping to max RAM is sensible.\r\n\r\n> In order to benefit from having the full UTXO set in RAM after a restart, we'd have to proactively load the entire UTXO set into -dbcache if space permits. Or maybe fill half the available space with coins, picked randomly.\r\n\r\nSome have used `cat .bitcoin/chainstate/* > /dev/null` to make a node that's far behind start syncing faster. Because of the disk io to read the chainstate folder, there's a trade off between initial speed and medium-term speed. A node mere hours behind shouldn't read the entire UTXO set into memory. But one that's weeks behind will reach tip faster if it does.\r\n\r\n> Though perhaps \"Stay at least 1 GiB below your RAM size\" may be safer, also because of swap behaviour (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29603#issuecomment-1991010152)\r\n\r\nThat's barely safe without swap, Bitcoin-QT and the OS will use most of the 1 GiB offset leaving it pretty close to locking up.\r\n\r\nWithout a swap file, an offset from total ram (1-2 GiB?) may avoid OOM, but this becomes arbitrary and may limit performance if set too low. It's better users w/o swap who set it too high OOM, than to limit performance of systems w/ swap that may benefit from more.\r\n\r\nSo total memory is still the best limit, if any is enforced.\r\n\r\n> We could suggest an optimum, but without further experimentation we don't know where that is.\r\n\r\nI've done a lot of tests on 4 GB and 8 GB RAM machines with zram swap and the -datadir on USB sticks and `available_RAM - 2 GiB` is about optimal for keeping those systems responsive. See this closed issue for more data: https://github.com/BenWestgate/Bails/issues/41\r\n\r\nWith `-dbcache=<available_RAM - 2 GiB>` both 4 GB and 8 GB RAM systems can unlock the screen and manipulate the desktop without exceeding a 10 second lag, after a user locks the screen and lets Bitcoin sync several hours. With 4 GB RAM, this is approximately our default `-dbcache=450` as suggested elsewhere to NOT raise it on 4 GB. If `-dbcache` is too high with a slow swap the machine may take minutes to respond. That's true even when the value is set lower than total or available memory. But whether that lag is undesirable or not depends on whether the user intends to use the machine or not before sync completes.\r\n\r\nSuggesting `dbcache=$(total_ram - 3650)` as an optimum place to start matches what some of our devs have recommended on stack exchange.",
