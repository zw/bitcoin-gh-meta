It removes our _last_ external dependency. That's a huge achievement imo. Barring us vendoring Boost, it's the difference between: \"take this lib and build a hello world app in your point-and-click IDE\" to \"use this docker image which includes our recommended version of boost headers to build from a script\". I know, I know, the latter is an exaggeration and wouldn't be the end of the world. But without boost, as-is right now, we'd be able to ship a libbitcoinkernel that depends on only [these headers](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/60da4fa6190e3a85d094f97dc8e578aeabcd22bf#diff-4cb884d03ebb901069e4ee5de5d02538c40dd9b39919c615d8eaa9d364bbbd77R1002-R1096) (though obviously paring down that list is a next step) and nothing from the outside world.

      "body" : "> I think this glosses over the larger result of this work: boost is now not a requirement for using libbitcoinkernel _at all_.\r\n\r\nYes this is a distinction I glossed over and didn't think much about. With this PR, boost is still a requirement for building libbitcoinkernel, but not a requirement for using it.\r\n\r\nBut I don't understand what the big advantage is (other than the ones already mentioned about speeding up build times or mixing versions of boost). And I don't undestand or what you are saying about the docker image and IDE. To my mind there are two type of developers who might want to use libbitcoinkernel:\r\n\r\n1. Developers who will want to use a packaged version of libbitcoinkernel in the form of a vcpkg, conan, nix, or wherever other package.\r\n2. Developers who will take a more DIY approach and put libbitcoinkernel in a vendor branch or monorepo or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this PR seems negligible in both of this cases, probably resulting in literal 1-line change like fd49dc99398a3ec331f393f877ec9ae804373043 removing a path from the include list.\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing maybe the thing you are enthusiastic about is supporting a third type of developer who (1) doesn't want to use a package and (2) doesn't want to build from source, but instead wants to download a tarball containing a precompiled libbitcoinkernel library binary and some headers, and use that. But the difference is pretty small in this case too, no? Without this PR the tarball needs to contain a few boost header files, and with this PR, it doesn't.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm happy about the benefits of this PR, but just think the main consideration here should be whether it improves the mempool code or not, and glad to see glozow had some suggestions for simplifying it.",

I'll admit to complete tunnel-vision on this particular boost removal. It's been ~an obsession~ a goal of mine for long enough that I'm probably too biased to judge the code changes required for it. And as you said, I don't think i need to belabor that point anyway when there's other merit to the changes.\r\n\r\n@glozow thanks for taking a look!

I think your additional patches are well worth reducing the amount of code that has to directly access the boost data structure from outside of the `CTxMemPool` class.\r\n\r\n> Would you maybe be interested in taking any of these changes?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes (as you mentioned) should be uncontroversial, e.g. just directly using existing helpers, or the `vTxHashes` changes. I'll gladly integrate these here. \r\n\r\nI think the `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` change would merit its own PRs, since it does change the internal behavior and performance somewhat. \r\n\r\nThe other two cases I am not sure about is using `infoAll()` (as done [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commit/c287d8dc5df644b04fa9b4ffc62c8537ce76730a#diff-9c5b83de6dc84af277e352c88b9291aa44340a3c75f572a0b51661eb0a838de9R347)) to create a vector of `TxMemPoolInfo` instead of directly iterating over `mapTx` and construction of a new `GenTxid` [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commit/971133f2ed0237c9473307f292bc365c47f7de0b#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R362). In both cases it would be fairly straight forward to replace them with new  `CTxMemPool` helper methods if they prove too controversial. ",
