So low-mempool-limit peers with a fee-filter not representing miners / default full-nodes mempool setting might be an individual source of failure for transaction-relay propagation and holistically a waste in fee-bumping reserves for Lightning nodes. \r\n\r\nI think it might makes sense in the long-term to discourage (or preferentially evict them) tx-relay peers with relatively lower mempool size than ours.

There are ~7.3k nodes with minfeefilter set to >= 9.5 sat/vbyte. I've observed similar behavior over the past couple weeks where there's a chunk of peers that have higher feefilters than the standard 300MB mempool. ",
