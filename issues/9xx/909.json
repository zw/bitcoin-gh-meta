   "body" : "Every day or two I run a script to move bitcoins between local and remote wallets.  The script hasn't been changed since 16th Feb, but one time when I ran it a few days ago it sent coins from the \"\" account, not the one I told it to.\n\nThe script runs:\nbitcoind sendfrom name $address $amount\n\nwhich should debit the \"name\" account.  And every time except for one that's what it did.  Now, however, if I check the balance of the \"name\" account, it is too high by the amount I transferred the time it went wrong, and if I \"listtransactions\" the transaction in question has:\n.        \"account\" : \"\",\ninstead of\n.        \"account\" : \"name\",\n\nI don't know how to get this to happen again - it's been fine for 6 months, only going wrong this one time.  It has been working again since the time it went wrong.\n\nI doubt it matters, but this is the script I use.  It's in a Makefile, so most of the $'s are doubled up:\n\nmove:\n    @x=$$($(BITCOIND) getbalance name 0) || exit;   \\\n     echo $$x | sed -E 's/[.]?00000000$$//';    \\\n     echo -n \"amount: \"; read Y; Y0=$$Y\"00000000\";  \\\n     echo \"send $$Y BTC to $(ADDRESS)?\";        \\\n     echo -n \"wallet passphrase: \"; read X; echo;       \\\n     $(BITCOIND) walletpassphrase \"$$X\" 300 &&  \\\n     ($(BITCOIND) sendfrom name $(ADDRESS) $$Y; \\\n      $(BITCOIND) walletlock;           \\\n      ssh server \"echo \\\"$$(date) - received $$Y BTC at $(ADDRESS)\\\" >> wallet.log\";    \\\n      $(BITCOIND) getbalance name 0 |       \\\n      sed 's/00000000$$//')\n",
