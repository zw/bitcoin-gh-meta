One thing that is pretty hard to translate is this here: \"Be careful to only sign statement you agree to with full details, as phishing attacks may try to trick you into signing access to them.\" I don't get it's meaning ... so german translation needs an update here (perhaps a native english speaking person can explain what is meant here). And I think the message displayed in RC2 is much longer, than what can be translated via Transifex!?",
