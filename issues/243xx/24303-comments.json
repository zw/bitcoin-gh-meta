Maybe this is a malformed question, feel free to chat me and we can flesh out if it's meaningful.\r\n\r\nAh I see, yeah I think the libbitcoinkernel case is very different from the libbitcoinconsensus case, since \"it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things which one may not normally expect from a library\". Right now if you build #24304 with `--enable-shared --enable-experimental-util-chainstate` you will find that the library relies on only the \"expect\" set of runtime libraries:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ldd ./src/.libs/libbitcoinkernel.so\r\n        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc387c6000)\r\n        libpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007faaecf6c000)\r\n        libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007faaecd56000)\r\n        libm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007faaecc12000)\r\n        libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007faaecbf7000)\r\n        libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007faaeca2b000)\r\n        /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007faaedc83000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, a good decision to ponder upon is whether or not we should be embedding libraries such as `leveldb`, `crc32c`, and `boost` or whether we should require them as a runtime dependency.

      "body" : "Thanks for posting #24332. Is #24332 your \"exploration branch\" or is that available somewhere else? A lot of things just seem vague to me and I think it would be useful to be concrete.\r\n\r\nIn general, the approach here seems a little different than I what would expect. I would expect most of the work of making the \"consensus engine\" usable as the library to involve getting rid of globals more than moving code around. Like I'd expect step one to be introducing some kind of context for the consensus code to be able to function. Something like a `src/kernel/context.h` file with a struct like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nnamespace kernel {\r\nstruct Context {\r\n  std::function<void(const std::string&)> log_fn;\r\n  std::function<std::string(const char*)> translate_fn;\r\n  std::optional<int64_t> adjusted_time;\r\n  std::unique_ptr<RNGState> rng_state;\r\n  Consensus::Params params;\r\n  std::unique_ptr<ChainstateManager> chainman;\r\n  std::unique_ptr<CTxMemPool> mempool;\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n} // namespace kernel\r\n```\r\n\r\nmeant to replace globals. Getting rid of globals would let you use the kernel library to write a application simulating multiple nodes. Or let you use the library to write an application that uses consensus functionality for something else, and still has unit tests that run in parallel (not forced to run serially because the kernel library has shared global state.)\r\n\r\nMoving code around and changing source code organization could be related to this, but doesn't have to be. I do think if you do want to change source code organization, you should have a clear idea of how the source code should be organized. Right now we already have:\r\n\r\n- `src/node/` and `libbitcoin_node.a`\r\n- `src/consensus/` and `libbitcoin_consensus.a`\r\n\r\nAnd you are proposing to add:\r\n\r\n- `src/kernel/` and `libbitcoin_kernel.a`\r\n\r\nThe current split between _node_ and _consensus_ makes sense to me. _Node_ is for code we consider internal and unstable and don't want to be reused externally. _Consensus_ is for code that is stable and we think is useful to expose. But maybe we should rename _node_ to _kernel_ or rename _consensus_ to _kernel_? Or maybe we should actually go ahead and keep _node_ and _consensus_ and add _kernel_ as a third middle layer. This could make sense if there is a clear idea of what belongs in this middle layer. Right now the kernel library sounds like a \"consensus engine\" or \"consensus support\" library for things that somehow have to do with consensus, but aren't in _consensus_ library.\r\n\r\nThe idea of excluding anything in the _consensus_ library that uses threads does not seem very tenable to me, when a lot of performant code people will want to write is likely to involve parallelization. It might make more sense if the dividing line had something to do with persistent storage. Like maybe `libbitcoin_consensus` would define abstract _mempool_ and _UTXO database_ interfaces, and `libbitcoin_kernel` would provide a `boost::multi_index` implementation of the _mempool_ interface, and a `leveldb` implementation of the _UTXO database_ interface.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303#issuecomment-1038359187\r\n> > I don't understand why there isn't a clearer answer about what's in the kernel and what's not in the kernel.\r\n> \r\n> What's included in `libbitcoinknernel` will always be \"everything that is required for the consensus engine to function\".\r\n\r\nThis doesn't really answer the question, just turns it into \"what things are in the consensus engine?\" or \"why isn't `libbitcoin_consensus.a` the consensus engine?\r\n\r\n> As of #24322, we're only capturing the dependencies **as they are right now**, which unfortunately includes things like `index/*.cpp`, `netaddress.cpp`, etc.\r\n> \r\n> Throughout stage 1, we will decouple (or in some cases, abstract away) these unnecessary modules from the consensus engine, which will allow us to remove them from `libbitcoinkernel`.\r\n> \r\n> Right now in my exploration branch, here is the list of files that are still necessary to be linked in:\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n>\r\n> A few modules that we decouple/abstract from:\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n\r\nThis all seems good, but probably the list of things to decouple should be almost as long as the original list, and there should be not very much code to move to `src/kernel/` if we are keeping `src/node/` and `src/consensus/`.\r\n\r\n> Do you mean that instead of (say) splitting off the consensus-used parts of `init/common.cpp` to `kernel/init/common.cpp`, we just explicitly mark their visibility as default or something?\r\n\r\nRight, everything's already public.\r\n\r\n> Oh of course! Here's an example: [dongcarl@d7cf3f0](https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/commit/d7cf3f0fc2af24e6d3d38513fb01c2b9d9d48105)\r\n> \r\n> In the first commit there, we split the parts of `timedata.cpp` not dependent on `netaddress.cpp` and `asmap.cpp` into `kernel/timedata.cpp`, which is \"move-only\" and allows us to eliminate `netaddress.cpp` and `asmap.cpp` from our `_SOURCES`.\r\n> \r\n> Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's a strictly better/easier to do this that I'm missing!\r\n\r\nCan you help me understand why this is an improvement? It seems like there could be benefits for understanding and testing and code reuse getting rid of the `g_timeoffset_mutex` and `nTimeOffset` globals and moving them into a context. But this PR just seems to be moving code from one location to another for some benefit I am unable to discern. Maybe there is some insight about the build system I'm missing, but the logic behind having:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/kernel/timedata.cpp\r\nsrc/kernel/timedata.h\r\nsrc/timedata.cpp\r\nsrc/timedata.h\r\n```\r\n\r\neludes me and I think I don't know what the end state is.",

I think it is important to create a context struct, because without one new code is forced to use global variables, and it is harder to get rid of globals gradualy without big blunt instrument changes. The libbitcoinkernel branch https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/commits/2022-01-v8-on-new-kirby makes reasonable choices about what to deglobalize and what not to (ArgsManager yes, LogInstance no), but in places where it's easy to add channels to avoid referencing globals more places I do think we should do that.",
