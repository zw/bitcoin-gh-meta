Keep getting the same error over and over.\r\nScreenshot of the problem: https://imgur.com/pj2KFrh\r\ndebug.log: https://pastebin.com/2LCw5BJt\r\nbitconi.conf: https://pastebin.com/ZsQArYRy\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a 250GB SDD and a 750GB HDD which I use as storage on my ubuntu 16.04. I have been running a full bitcoin node for a few weeks which I just use to practice interacting with the bitcoin client. A few days ago I turned on my node and got this\r\n\r\nEXCEPTION: N5boost10filesystem16filesystem_errorE       \r\nboost::filesystem::space: Operation not permitted       \r\nbitcoin in AppInit()       \r\n\r\nError: Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details\r\nError: Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details\r\n\r\nI have NO idea how to proceed. I have uninstalled bitcoin core from my system, reformatted my storage drive, reinstalled ubuntu, and just spend hours trying to debug this f'ing issue. I have posted on several message boards and have received literally no helpful replies. My storage HDD is located within the media folder, which I changed permissions on for any user to use. Occasionally bitcoind will start and simply just stay at block 0.... Really frustrated and quite frankly im on the verge of moving on to other projects. Any help me would be greatly appreciated. ",
