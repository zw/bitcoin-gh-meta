In that case, when I look at a wallet, it awfully looks like a 3rd-party software artefact, whereas private keys looks like the thing I should only worry about. I now understand that you own bitcoins by owning a wallet and thats because, actually, of those change addresses. Correct me if Im wrong but if you \"remove\" the change addresses, you \"remove\" the wallets. Im not suggesting you should actually remove change addresses which makes no sense, I understand now the tech works like this; all Im saying is that wallets are here because change address are here, the whole thing being rooted in the tech. That defines wallets (how many users, particularly the tech savvy ones, could tell what wallets are really for?). A unix-an want to learn that quickly, during his user experience.\r\nAlso, I think it's missing some unix-an hints of whats happening during bitcoin core execution: I would expect to literally see the change address mechanism for each transactions, importprivkey included. Right now, importprivkey output things on the console (a \"null\") but doesnt output anything on the app. The app should log visibly everything that's happening, I think. When you grep or curl or whatever, you get to see everything right? :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, ultimately, Im sure those information are available somewhere, therefore the mistake is on me.",
