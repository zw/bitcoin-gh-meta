   "body" : "When restoring the main window from the system tray, it always was in minimized state (at least on Windows). This patch should fix this. The window should restore to the same state as it was  at the moment of minimizing it into the tray.\r\n\r\nMay be related to issue #8225 \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug do following under Windows:\r\n* In Options->Window enable \"Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar\"\r\n* Optionally enable \"Minimize on close\", too\r\n* Minimize the main window\r\n* Klick on the tray icon (or right click on the tray icon and select Show/Hide)\r\n\r\nThe main window's taskbar icon appears, but the window itself is not restored to its original size.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: the window should appear.",
