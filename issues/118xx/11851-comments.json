There's even a comment in walletdb.h to say so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Overview of wallet database classes:\r\n *\r\n * - CDBEnv is an environment in which the database exists (has no analog in dbwrapper.h)\r\n * - CWalletDBWrapper represents a wallet database (similar to CDBWrapper in dbwrapper.h)\r\n * - CDB is a low-level database transaction (similar to CDBBatch in dbwrapper.h)\r\n * - CWalletDB is a modifier object for the wallet, and encapsulates a database\r\n *   transaction as well as methods to act on the database (no analog in\r\n *   dbwrapper.h)\r\n *\r\n * The latter two are named confusingly, in contrast to what the names CDB\r\n * and CWalletDB suggest they are transient transaction objects and don't\r\n * represent the database itself.\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should probably go in just before branching v0.16, since rebasing on top of this will be a pain.\r\n\r\nOther changes you could consider:\r\n\r\n- manually update that overview comment (and perhaps move to `wallet.h`?)\r\n- rename the `wallet/db` and `wallet/walletdb` files to be more descriptive. Perhaps `wallet/berkeley_db` and `wallet/db_checkpoint`, but I'm sure we could do better than that.\r\n\r\nI think your suggested class names are good ('checkpoint' is certainly better than 'transaction'!). I can't currently think of anything better.",

I didn't move it into `wallet.h` for now because it sounds from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#discussion_r155354119 like a goal is to pull database reading and writing code out of main wallet class, which would make `wallet.h` not the right place for it.\r\n\r\n> rename the wallet/db and wallet/walletdb files to be more descriptive. Perhaps wallet/berkeley_db and wallet/db_checkpoint, but I'm sure we could do better than that.\r\n\r\nI'd be inclined to rename `wallet/db.h` to `wallet/db-berkeley.h`, leaving room for other implementations like `wallet/db-dummy.h`, `wallet/db-sqlite.h`, `wallet/db-log.h` (#5686), etc.\r\n\r\nI'd be inclined to rename `wallet/walletdb.h` something like `wallet/serialize.h`, `wallet/schema.h`, `wallet/kvschema.h`, `wallet/db.h`, or `wallet/db-keyvalue.h` since it's mainly responsible for key value serialization and mostly not tied to the berkeleydb backend. This would make more sense with the CWalletDB -> CDB dependency removed or reversed, though.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdded 1 commits 003b6190e5a3d870a5eca3195e2381ee4b93de4d -> 51eaec47ccb61de2d791c86b785ee4cf111c3b05 ([pr/wren.1](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wren.1) -> [pr/wren.2](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wren.2), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/wren.1...pr/wren.2))",

But I think John's comment is basically right. WalletBatch code should be agnostic to berkeley db details and potentially able to work with another key-value backend, while BerkeleyBatch should contain more berkeley specific stuff. This is mostly true right now, and could be made more true with some refactoring, which I can follow up with. You should talk to John though about whether you prefer this comment or the previous comment, or want to combine them somehow.",
