However, the python code used for the unit tests and the few scripts meant for users is rather condensed and hopefully not much refactored in the future. So by not touching them, they should keep their compatibility.\r\nNote that the loose scripts are not (regularly) tested on py2 nor py3, so just declaring that they no longer function with py2 isn't a huge improvement. (Or making them merly incompatible with py2 isn't a huge improvement either, imo). As long as they are not rewritten in a large-ish way, I don't see why we should change the dependency requirements...\r\n",

      "body" : "Hi. Andrew (the biplist maintainer) reviewed the Core patch and rejected it. Here's his rationale. Any thoughts? I admit that I'm not super familiar with the biplist codebase, so it would take a little time for me to come up with a coherent response.\r\n\r\n(Technically, this isn't a Py3 issue, but since I brought it up here earlier....)\r\n\r\n> I looked into this, and it looks like v1.0.2 added sorting of sets and dictionary keys when writing, which is the change needed for reproducible builds. The patch from Bitcoin Core targets biplist v0.9, which didn't have this sorting.\r\n\r\n> The below two changes from the Bitcoin Core patch seem to have any effect when writing plists, AFAICT (please correct me if I am wrong). One is wrapping the root dict in a hashable wrapper, so sorting the keys doesn't matter. The other is for computing some values in the file trailer related to how many unique objects there are in the file and how many bytes it takes to represent the offsets to those objects within the file.\r\n\r\n> That said, this is under-tested, so I [added a test](https://bitbucket.org/wooster/biplist/commits/4c3d0c94132621188ca4c1fa9bda3b2d4d52ab82) for what I expect the output to be.\r\n\r\n> Thanks!\r\n\r\n**EDIT 1**: I think the \"two changes\" comment had to do with [this commit](https://bitbucket.org/wooster/biplist/commits/2b1c1ab5525cb55c270dc6ac4a91ed85648125e2), which is the 1.0.2 commit that supposedly adds sorting.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2**: [biplist has been sorted out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12625).",
