Below that you need many more hacks to build as some functions are not present",

      "body" : "@tofutim sorry just saw this. No I don't have gitian-descriptor. Ideally it would have one but really I wanted to make sure we could use the latest NDK (still on r14b because of 32bit archs failing on later versions) and upstream necessary changes where possible. Right now I'm in the process of refreshing to 0.16.1 and at least build the 64 bit arch with r17b",
