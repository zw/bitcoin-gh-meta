It's not specifically for developers (who tend to use `bitcoin-cli` in most cases anyhow), but also not for people just getting started. They might be better off installing one of the mobile wallets.\r\n\r\nThe most important design principle is \"make it hard to make mistakes\". Bitcoin is very much like industrial GUIs, in that safety is a primary concern. Mistakes are generally irreversible, and costly. Which is why I tend to discourage the \"cool gui\" kind of designers. Making the GUI look cool or fashionable is not the point, and never was.\r\n\r\nTrained designers that have worked on projects with a lot at stake, and understand human psychology in that context, would definitely be welcome. It does mean that some developer has to communicate with them. and implement their ideas, or it's not going to work. I do not personally have time to do serious work on the GUI anymore.",

The traffic doesn't really matter. But they're interested enough to run the software virtually 24/7.\r\n\r\n> They have the ability to use bitcoin-cli but using the GUI is somehow faster for them?\r\n\r\nI think that's a significant part, yes. They might be able to use bitcoin-cli or the console, but might also be scared of it (easy to make mistakes!), or use the GUI because it's more convenient.\r\n\r\nI think that's a realistic aim. Maybe at some point in the future Bitcoin Core will be suitable for non-technical beginners, but it's important to not focus on that at actual user's expense. E.g. by removing features that people care about. GNOME comes to mind.\r\n\r\nAlso whatever the designer wants need to work in the context of Qt. The project is not going to switch to a web GUI like electron. A lot is possible with [QML](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883) though.\r\n",

So if your requirement is to run a full node (even if it is just booted once a month to pay for a bill), the GUI is a candidate try out.\r\n\r\nGiven that parts of the GUI \"wrap\" the RPC interface, some tooltips and confirmation dialogs (which are needed to prevent costly mistakes as pointed out by @laanwj), as well as warnings or errors tend to be technical. Thus, the GUI is maybe less accessible to users than a mobile wallet.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current situation should not prevent us from shipping a GUI that is just as easy to use as a mobile wallet. The long term plan to move the GUI to a separate repository makes it also possible to have multiple GUIs, each of which resonates with a different user base.",

Perform a fresh installation of Bitcoin Core on a computer which is ready for full disk wiping.\r\n\r\n2. Launch Bitcoin Core, then wait for it to sync.\r\n\r\n3. Unplug the ethernet cable. For laptops, the WiFi/BT module should also been dismantled.\r\n\r\n4. Import the \"precious\" private key with `importprivkey`. Wait for the rescan to be done.\r\n\r\n5. Compose & sign the transaction with the wallet GUI. The imported \"precious private key\" would obviously be reused by specifying \"custom change address\" (otherwise it would be just another tragedy like #11827). Then copy the raw transaction data.\r\n\r\n6. Use QR code or USB thumb drive to carry out raw transaction data. Then the transaction could be broadcasted to the network.\r\n\r\n7.

      "body" : "My personal view and projections on the GUI:\r\n\r\n1. I think we should not give up the hope to make Bitcoin Core a wallet for non experienced users\r\n2. Things like hybrid SPV mode (#9483), pruning and block-filter based p2p-fetch wallet rescans could make things way more attractive for novice users\r\n3. On top, resource management could be done better. Use full, heavy CPU resources only if the user is AFK or if he/she intentionally allows Bitcoin Core to draw all resources. Otherwise the system may get really unusable for a few hours on a catch-up/sync. Sometimes the time to catch up a few days of blocks is irrelevant but the user prefers to have enough resources available to watch a movie or do some word processing, etc.\r\nRight now the default approach is **sync as fast as possible**. Which may be desirable for server based VPS, etc. But often not for home/personal desktop systems. \r\n4. I agree with @laanwj that the GUI doesn't need to be a super-modern HTML/CSS whatever. It needs to fulfil its job. Clear communication, simple to extend (Qt/cross platform), minimal resource needs (no HTML/CSS/JS).\r\n5. However, there are many things that need more love. Among many ideas, a new wizard that helps people setting up the right configuration (pruning, blockfilters, maxscripthreads, etc.) in a way that is really simple to understand, would be one of the things that non experience users would appreciate.\r\n\r\nIf I would have some wishes open, one of them would be that the GUI works perfectly asynchronous over the RPC interface with a push channel like long-polling (#7949). I'm pretty convinced that this approach should work also for performance critical stuff.\r\nAnd not least, it would allow to use the GUI via a wireguard/VPN (run the GUI on a different machine) and the modularity would allow other GUIs / backends.",
