As a new contributor who is doing this after hours, it could take several days to do something that a seasoned contributor could do in <1h, so there could be a fear they start with something that is already solved when they are done. But everyone has to start somewhere so this is ok. I would actually encourage first-timers to indicate they are working on something and report more on their progress if they are stuck, so I like encouraging them to ask for help. I can imagine that sometimes it seems like a lack of effort when they are actually just overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nI also like the \"Requirement\" as a hint of what skills could be useful so that newcomers don't dive into something that turns out to be too complicated for them. However, I would frame it a little softer as something like: \"It would be very helpful if you have experience with...\".\r\n\r\nActually, the main skill lacking in new contributors that I have seen (in my short time) was using Git properly. Since there are sections on that in contributing.md I would include it as well.",

I wonder if the \"official\" process should be to announce you are planning to work on this issue as a new contributor. This doesn't stop other people working on it, it could encourage collaboration if more than one new contributor give it a go. But it is useful for both the new contributor to know if others are working on it and for experienced contributors to check in with the new contributor to see if they are making progress.\r\n\r\nI wonder also if people who are active but still relatively new contributors can be assigned as good points of contact for basic stuff like Git.
