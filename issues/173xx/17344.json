We are currently using `-Wformat=1` which doesn't enable `-Wformat-security` (part of `-Wformat=2`). | 0 | 0 |\r\n| `-Wlogical-op`: Warn about logical operations being used where bitwise were probably wanted  | 0 | Not supported |\r\n| `-Wnon-virtual-dtor`: Warn the user if a class with virtual functions has a non-virtual destructor. This helps catch hard to track down memory errors.  | 22 | 10 |\r\n| `-Wnull-dereference`: Warn if a potential `nullptr` dereference is detected  | 48 | Not supported |\r\n| `-Woverloaded-virtual`: Warn if you overload (not `override`) a virtual function  | 0 | 0 |\r\n| `-Wunreachable-code-loop-increment`: Warn if a loop will run only once (loop increment never executed)  | Not supported | 1 |\r\n| `-Wunused-member-function`: Warn on unused member function  | Not supported | 2 |\r\n| `-Wunused-template`: Warn on unused template | Not supported | 1 |\r\n\r\nThere is a large overlap between this list and [Jason Turner's list of recommended compiler diagnostics in the Collaborative Collection of C++ Best Practices (`cppbestpractices`) project](https://github.com/lefticus/cppbestpractices/blob/master/02-Use_the_Tools_Available.md#gcc--clang). There is also an overlap with the recommendations given in the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).\r\n\r\nI'm now seeking feedback regarding these diagnostics: which of these would make sense to enable in the Bitcoin Core project? :)",
