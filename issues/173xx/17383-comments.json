I think it would make sense longer-term if modules managed their own arguments, but for now, that's not the case so init.cpp is the right place for them. If you take a look at the constants I've moved init init.cpp, you'll see:\r\n\r\n- `DEFAULT_TXINDEX` (was in validation but is part of the index module)\r\n- `DEFAULT_BLOCKFILTERINDEX` (was in validation but is part of the index module)\r\n- `DEFAULT_PERSIST_MEMPOOL` (was in validation. Is perhaps part of validation, but all the mempool loading/dumping code is in init.cpp)\r\n- `DEFAULT_PEERBLOOMFILTERS` (was in net_processing, but is part of the net module)",

Failing on argument parsing when threads have already been spun up is inconvenient. It's exactly what is wrong at the moment, why parsing can't fail in `ParseBool` and `ParseInt` but have to return something no matter how little sense their input makes.",
