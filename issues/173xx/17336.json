Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\nWhen bitcoind is running in pruned mode, producing a hashlist with `./linearize-hashes.py linearize.cfg > hashlist.txt` and then executing `linearize-data.py linearize.cfg` will produce:\r\n```\r\nRead 313001 hashes\r\nInput file /home/dan/.bitcoin/blocks/blk00000.dat\r\nPremature end of block data\r\n```\r\nThis happens because `linearize-data` starts by attempting to process `blk00000.dat` regardless of whether or not `blk00000.dat` actually exists - this may not be the case if working with a pruned node.\r\nThis PR adds a function which finds the first block file that does exist, and calls that function when the `BlockDataCopier` is initialized.\r\n\r\nThis is a refactor of #16431.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
