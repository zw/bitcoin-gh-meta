   "body" : "This is a brainstorming issue on the GUI. If I am missing context of past discussions on this please direct me to links (That is certainly possible, there have been years of discussions I am not aware of). I am opening this because I value my time and other contributors' time rather than because I am a regular user of the GUI (Disclaimer: I'm not but I have started reviewing some GUI related PRs and am interested in continuing to do so.)\r\n\r\nI am not a trained UX/UI designer but there appears to be some basic design principles when it comes to designing the GUI and providing feedback on GUI PRs that are being ignored on this project. Ideally we'll get some trained designers to start contributing to the project who can carry out basic feedback exercises to ensure GUI changes are informed and not subject to biases, bikeshedding etc\r\n\r\n1) Who are we designing the GUI for? Long term Core contributors (highly technical) that use the GUI on a regular basis? I don't know how many of these there are. Technically curious who use the GUI when they can't work out how to do something from the command line? Complete Bitcoin beginners? All of these groups? If it is the latter then we should all be under no illusions that compromises are necessary which will mean it is impossible for the design to be optimal for an individual group.\r\n\r\n2) Design preferences are subject to the \"sample size of 1\" trap where those reviewing GUI changes think they are providing feedback on behalf of a group that they don't belong to. A highly technical user just does not know what is optimal for a beginner. The only way you see what is optimal for a beginner is putting alternative GUIs in the hands of a statistically significant group of beginners. \r\n\r\nAn example open PR that motivated this issue is #16966. This is not picking on any of the people involved in that PR. When the project was smaller with fewer contributors there was no alternative other than individuals discussing their personal preferences. But at some stage (and certainly if we want the GUI to be used by greater numbers of users) we need a more effective collective thought process on this.\r\n\r\nI've reached out to some designers in the Bitcoin community and hopefully some of them will get involved in this discussion and/or review of future GUI PRs.\r\n",
