It sounded to me like you were expressing the view that a fix wouldn't be accepted if it was submitted without an automated test, if so I believe that isn't a position that we should take.\r\n\r\nIf instead you were just expressing doubt that there was actually a bug here to fix, then I agree. But coming with an automated test is not the bar for determining if a bug exists or not. I also think it's great to ask contributors if they'd be willing to automate their test, but we should probably lean towards \"I'll help you figure out how to do it\" especially for new contributors, rather than \"you must be this tall to ride, good luck\".\r\n\r\nAnd our urgency should be modulated somewhat by how easy it would be to accidentally regress: If someone finds a spelling error in a help message we're not exactly going to insist on adding a regression test which checks that help output for the misspelled word. :)  Some fixes have a low probability of an accidentally regression and a targeted test which only catches that one behaviour may well not be worth its maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if a 'bug' were really inconsequential-- then I could support a position that including a test would be a minimum proof of work before we'd bother dealing with it, but this would be a serious bug if it were real.\r\n\r\nWhich I suspect it isn't:\r\n\r\n> $ ./bitcoin-cli addmultisigaddress 2 '[\"04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f\",\"047211a824f55b505228e4c3d5194c1fcfaa15a456abdf37f9b9d97a4040afc073dee6c89064984f03385237d92167c13e236446b417ab79a0fcae412ae3316b77\",\"0496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858ee\"]' \"\" bech32\r\n> {\r\n>  \"address\": \"3J1pwTY92a2vcdqVZF4J4Ut1tdbsst68rE\",\r\n\r\nIt's a little surprising that its silently auto-returning legacy when you give it an explicit parameter, it might be better to return an error, but before actually arguing that I'd want to go look to see if that had already been discussed.
