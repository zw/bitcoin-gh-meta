That way the released binaries are closer to the binaries that were tested by developers that compile on native mac.\r\n\r\nYes. But in the process we should update cctools/ld64 as well as the SDK. In the past, we've tried to find combinations that were close to what Apple was supporting at the time. That avoids situations like new clang warnings from old SDK headers.\r\n\r\nEdit: To clarify, I think we should start by updating everything and see if that magically solves the problem. If not, go from there.",
