      "body" : "> Why would spy nodes claim to be blocksonly? To not get asked for txs?\r\n\r\nSorry, my explanation was unclear. Let me try again:\r\n\r\n1. I start my node in `-blocksonly`\r\n2. I make up to 8 outbound connections, with [fRelay](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki#Extensions_to_existing_messages) set to False.\r\n3. Most peers (including most Satoshi:0.18.0 peers) honor that relay=False request and don't send me tx INVs. However, some of my outbound connections *do* send me tx INVs in violation of my request to not relay transactions. Those peers also have subver set to Satoshi:0.18.0. Even if I disconnect and reconnect to those peers, they continue to send me tx INVs.\r\n\r\nExplanations:\r\n- there's a bug in Bitcoin Core v0.18 that under some circumstances makes them disregard fRelay=False. I've looked at the VERSION deserialization and net_processing logic and find this unlikely.\r\n- they aren't really Bitcoin Core 0.18 nodes and are just masquerading as such. They haven't implemented the relay logic properly.\r\n\r\nThe peers that I found that do this are on the spylist here: https://people.xiph.org/~greg/banlist.cli.txt",

(I'm not sure if you intend this PR to be standalone from that one or not)\r\n\r\nCorrect, but it only affects the two outbound blocks-only peers in that PR. The new behaviour would be to disconnect those blocks-only peers that are misbehaving and make new blocks-only peers. Given that the part of the justification for that PR was that the additional blocks-only peers would not cause too much additional resource usage, I think it's reasonable to disconnect them if they're wasting our bandwidth\r\n\r\n> I think the right thing to do would be, for example, to downgrade the connection to a non-blocksonly connection rather than disconnect and try finding a new blocksonly peer.\r\n\r\nI disagree:\r\n- for a full `blocksonly` node, there are no non-blocksonly peers. Are you saying we should disregard the user's wishes and keep these connections as tx relay peers?\r\n- for 15759, the tx relay datastructures aren't initialized for blocks-only peers (to save memory). If we changed those blocks-only peers to be tx relay peers, we'd need to add those tx relay datastructures later. That makes the code more complex, and invalidates the resource-usage argument in that PR (since we might just end up with 10 full tx relay peers).\r\n\r\n> Disagreement nonwithstanding, IIRC there is software which will send unsolicited TX messages as well, so you may want to look into handling peers who send those as well.\r\n\r\nThanks! I've updated this PR to also ban peers which relay TX messages to us when we've set relay=False.",

Oh, per travis you need to hold cs_main before calling Misbehaving in the NetMsgType::TX case.\r\n\r\nI think I'd be more confident that this was a safe change to make if we merged #15759 first and could look through our logs to see how often the two blocks-only peers of any random node see this sort of misbehaviour?\r\n\r\nI think as much as avoiding wasting bandwidth, there's an argument for this sort of change from the POV of tolerating protocol misbehaviour isn't good for the quality of the software ecosystem, a la https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iab-protocol-maintenance-01 . Even if that only results in higher quality spy nodes, I guess that's still an improvement...\r\n\r\nAlternatively/longer-term, we could perhaps extend `m_protect` to support a \"keep working if things are at all recoverable, just in case everyone's failing in the same ways\" fallback behaviour. Something like:\r\n\r\n * mark your first four full outbound peers and first blocks only outbound peer as `m_protect`\r\n * when peers do something bad, but recoverable, if they're marked `m_protect` just set a `questionable` flag, rather than immediately disconnecting them\r\n * every ~60min on a poisson timer, if you've got a `questionable==true` peer, and have another `m_protect=false` peer of the same class that's been connected for >20min, disconnect the questionable peer and mark the other peer as `m_protect`\r\n\r\nThough even that only protects you from disconnecting your outbound nodes, it doesn't prevent them from disconnecting you as an inbound node if your client is misbehaving. But if it's your client misbehaving at least you have some chance of being able to fix that directly. Could protect some of your inbound nodes too, I guess, but that doesn't seem very robust to adversarial behaviour.",

It might make sense to move the test into the `else` clause -- if you're in `-blocksonly` you'll only have RPC-submitted tx's in `mapRelay` anyway, so the `if` path should be fine, and this way you disconnect anyone prying pretty quickly?",
