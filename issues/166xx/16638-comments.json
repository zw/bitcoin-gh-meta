I'm not spending time on 0.14 - 0.16.\r\nI'd just like to tidy up translations on transifex and move translations from locales to languages ((cs_CZ) to (cs) for example), because we don't need a locale for czech language.\r\nTo do this in a clean way, I'd also have to move 0.14-0.16 translations around (or just delete them), which I can't at the moment.\r\n\r\nI was asking you for permissions/credentials to do that, but I can't exactly remember when and where.\r\nI've also sent you a message on transifex a while ago, asking for coordinator/reviewer role for slovenian language (si) and (si_SI) (account name _gasper.cefarin_).\r\n\r\nI've already done a lot of cleaning and some reorganizing on traqnsifex- you'll see the bump in edited/translated words on transifex dashboard for August.",
