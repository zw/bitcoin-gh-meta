This results in a confusing lack of error feedback.\r\n\r\n> Avoid this problem by ensuring the first field containing an error is scrolled into view when Send is clicked.\r\n\r\nYou can see the behavior here: https://imgur.com/a/QZG5TQc\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\nAdd a few recipients and give any of them an invalid address or amount. Scroll the invalid recipient out of view and hit Send. With this change, the GUI will scroll to show the invalid recipient, with master it will not, \"hiding\" the error.\r\n",
