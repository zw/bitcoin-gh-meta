We could even make it shorter as `bitcoin-cli +lock` for enabling and `bitcoin-cli +-lock` for disabling, using jut a `+` (no change needed for the syntax in bitcoin.conf files: `debug=category` or `nodebug=category` for individual categories or for special categories \"0\" or \"none\", \"1\" or \"all\", but eventually it could support comma-separated lists).\r\n\r\nNote that with these crashes/hangs, the UPNP thread is still running as I see its logs every few minutes (apparently it does not lock indexer threads, or RPC threads or validation threads; but it locks the connection handler thread that adds/removes new connections and manages the address list; but they are not affected: I can see on bitnode.io that my \"hanged\" nodes are connected but experiment either timeouts, or extremely long response times for more than 5 minutes to incoming requests from nodes already connected, and my firewall see them connecting with success, sending requests, but getting no reply to their RPC requests)\r\n\r\nAlso I've tried both Windows (v11, Pro or Enterprise) and Linux (Debian Bullseye) on the same host (different VMs but same hypervisor, similar CPU/RAM/storage config, just a different filesystem NTFS vs. Ext4): the Windows version is MUCH faster by several factors (I bet Windows has a better I/O system, better caching strategies and a more responsive scheduler for multhreading and for handling mutexes). Debian in WSL (HyperV hypervisor on Windows) run with similar performances than native Windows but faster than native Debian (there may be tuning parameters for the Debian native kernel, but I did not invest time in it); i did not tune any guest or host OS specifically to run these tests, so did not use any root/administrator commands, except for installing required third party packages or system libraries and performing standard system updates with \"sudo apt update/upgrade\" on Debian, or Windows Update in Windows 11, and did not use any custom repositories for these packages).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNote: I am currently rebuilding again after performing a `git pull` to the current main branch (23.99? targetting the next version 24.0). Should I pull instead from the 23.x archived branch?",

      "body" : "Also that that these hangs of the RPC service never occur if I use a RPC command immediately after startup to disable all communications (for exampIe have all the necessary blocks already downloaded, or just enough of them already there  (thounsands from a backup e.g. from `blocks2/*` to `blocks/*`) so that I can run indexers (including several ones: chainstate, txindex, coinsdb,...). The bugs seems to occur when the chaintips are updated by incoming new blocks or undo blocks being added to `blocks/blk*dat` and `blocks/rev*.dat`, and apparently changing the total number of chaintips, and possibly changing the active one in the main branch.\r\nI frequently also use backups of `chainstate/*` to `chainstate2/*` or `indexes/*` to `indexes2/*`, by stopping bitcoind after about 30 minutes: if it exits properly (if not I need to \"kill -9\" bitcoind, then restart bitcoind to see which index is corrupted, bitcoind will exit after a few seconds and I will restore the failed index directory from the backup).\r\n\r\nSometimes even if there's no \"corruption\" detected and indexing restarts, it may hang very rapidly (depending on which peers are connected or not and if they submit new blocks to be downloaded) and bitcoind sometimes never runs withotu hanging for more than a couple of minutes (especially in the European trading evening around 17:00 UTC, if I'm not lucky), but never more than half an hour (even in late night with reduced transactions rate, so we only get smaller block updates once every ~10 minutes).\r\n\r\nBasically for now this is the only way I was able to complete the IBD (frequent need to restore the \"chainstate\" index), and then with exactly the same difficulties the other indexes (notably the coinsdb index which is very sensitive to incoming changes in the topology of the block chain with new concurrent branches created by miners, or \"dead\" branches caused by a new consensus). You can experiment these frequent problems with at least 8 CPU cores; they are much more exceptional with just 2 cores (the NUMA topology does not seem to play a major role, as well whether these are parallel threads in the same physical core or note; you can similate it using CPU affinity controls with system tools, or changing them in the hypervisor if you run bitcoind in a VM; as well the exact CPU model or CPU firmware updates in the BIOS or OS, or the CPU vendor like Intel or AMD does not play any role, these problems occur on all CPU configs I tested: some peers continue to upload blocks that they should have purged since long).\r\n\r\nAnother note I made after I was forced to \"kill -9\" bitcoind, and restored the broken indexes after a 1st attmpt to restart, is that after the next successful restart, the \"memory pool\" lists thousands of \"failed\" transactions, when the mempool is reloaded. They are not \"old\", more recent than the last 72 hours by default, all related to the most recent blocks announced and received from specific peers). But this also happens with specific historic blocks (when running the IBD for a new full node, where somewhere are records of a \"late\" switch to another branch spanning several blocks to be invalidated and discarded or partially merged to better blocks).\r\n\r\nHowever these hangs seem to be correlated to the activity of some miners or trading services, running specific versions of some Bitcoin engines (most probably sending broken blocks, or disobeying the rules of the standard protocol for these blocks or in specific types of transactions or signatures. This looks like BIP158 is incorrectly implemented by them, or they did not update their broken software: is there a way to detect them and ban them automatically so they won't alter the chain with their bad announcements? Or is it a defect of the protocol itself? Or some stricter validation code missing in Bitcoin Core? Or a bug in the validation code made by Bitcoind Core, not correctly handling cases where some blocks or transactions are invalidated and marked to be discarded?).",

(I only added -DDEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION as instructed).\r\nAnyway, the way multiple locks are acquired in the same thread, but not always in the same order depending on threads, can be a cause of deadlock between these threads. If you need a second lock and hold already one, you should release the 1st one, and then acquire both at the same time (and always in the same order). This may force you to rollback an ongoing atomic transaction, and restart it (and can also perform the second atomic operation needing the 2nd lock) once you got the two locks,\r\n\r\nI think this is a case of deadlock, where the message handler already owns one mutex and then repeatedly locks/unlocks the same second mutex, but never releases the 1st mutex that other concurrent threads need to be unfrozen and continue their operations.",

Isn't that incoming request too large? How so we reply to such large request? Normally we should reply by jsut giving a reasonnable fragment and let the peer request other later (or from other peers than us). But it seems that such large request still attempts to lock a too large subset of our chain, more than needed, and apparently this is not possible because there's an indexer (for coinsdb) running in the background (still locking blocks at a lower height, and progressing).\r\n\r\nAs there's no \"usleep\" between operations of the indexer before getting the mutex for the next block to index, and no \"usleep\" as well in the message handler for other concurrent threads giveing some free time for other threads, and because we have not defined priorities between threads a thread my release and hold the same mutex repeatedly, without giving a chance for other threads to get it. This is a case of \"starvation\" caused by a \"selfish\" thread making unsafe assumptions that it can always rnu as fast as he wish. Such cases are generally resovled by adding a small randomized usleep() (or yielding to other threads at least once every N operations, with N about 100 to 200, if you don't want to use a random generator; in other multhreaded applications I generally use N=113 because it is a \"good\" prime generating enough variations), before or after atomic operations (but never inside the atomic operation when the mutex is hold).\r\n\r\nNote: I've not tested by diabling UPNP in bitcoin.conf to see if there's such freezes again. UPNP is visible here because that is the only thread allowed to run without using any mutex, so it just witnesses that that thread is working. This could be replaced by any other thread sending dummy \"I'm running\" logs every few minutes, and doing nothing else with our mutexes.",

I can interrupt again the program, and I see that the message handler thread is still there, inside a call to ChainstateManager::ProcessNewBlockHeaders(...) which seems to never terminate. Apparently one of its iterator (on `std::multimap<CBlockIndex*,CBlockIndex*,CBlockIndex*>` at validation.cpp:4412) never finds an end when processing new block headers received (but probably still not in a valid state to be processed, or depending on other blocks that first need to be parsed and can't if they are exclusively locked by some background thread indexing it, while that other indexing thread wants to lock a mutex owned by the message handler, that cannot return it). This is clearly a deadlock condition: the message handler can hold a lock for an infinite time, and is unable to fix a limit and abort to retry later: its iterators are imperative and must go from start to end of the new headers recieved. That iterator is then unsafe.\r\n\r\nNote: this is still a debug version compiled with the current master branch from git pull.

      "body" : "Except that #16998 had no reply since long, for the stacktrace that I proivided here. I can't be sure that #16998 was a duplicate or is just stalled and shuold have been closed for lack of response, not even a question about how to do it if the reporter wondered how to use gdb (here I may explain how to do it if you can't attach gdb to an already running process).\r\n\r\nAt least here  give the source of the bug at [validation.cpp:4412], which cannot work correctly with concurrent threads updating the chainstate (e.g. new block downloaded, or change of best changetip while validating ), because it attempts to parse the whole chain but seems to assume that the best chaintip and more generally its topology cannot change when there are concurrent branches for the last few blocks near the tips\r\n\r\nSo the iterator will not terminate by reaching the correct tip: it should terminate when reaching any tip. It does not implement a full tree search and cannot rollback to lower heights to find alternate branches (in my opinion it should explore all branches: if there are several ones, it is beacuse they are concurrent and none of them are validated, so any one good be valid until one of them is validated, and this takes some time (about 10 minutes) to reach a consensus and being informed from the network. However there should be only one branch going from a block at a given height to a block of next height, if that target block is validated; other branches should be pruned according to the consensus rules.\r\n\r\nAs well, as long as blocks are still not fully loaded and indexed in the chainstate (this takes hours, maybe several days during IBD for full nodes), we always have multiple tips (one old but validated snice long, and one or several near the end of the chain that we've still not indexed, and possibly still not downloaded, and creating more \"active\" tips).\r\n\r\nFor now the code used in \"check block index\" does not seem to be valid, it is overly optimistic.... or there are some local operations occuring within the \"chain\" that do not use atomic operations protected by the same global mutex (actually the \"chain\" is a tree with short branches near the tips, with transactions to be validated and made in at most the last 2 days, i.e. roughly 288 blocks, but the protocol is designed so that concurrent branches should not survive for more then one day, and if the P2P network is correctly connected, those branches may not live for more than 1 hour, i.e. 6 blocks, and most of the time they do not persist for more than 10 minutes, within the last 2 block heights if the local node is fully synchronized).\r\n\r\nThe current code for \"check block index\" cannot work if validators are running or if we have live connections with other peers and we download new blocks announced by them because we've requested a set of fresh headers. It may only be safely used when the node is restarting after a shutdown, and before even initiating its IBD phase. Or it could be used when the daemon is shut down, to perform offline analysis and reparation. Or when running the daemon when its \"net\" is offline and does not open or accept any connection with other peers, and as well it should stop all validators that may change the topology when selecting new tips. That could be initiated by a specific RPC call, that will temporarily suspend all network activity, flush everything as needed, perform check and necessary pruning and that could be also initiated automatically every hour (normally it does not take long, less than one second on my PC, we don't necessarily need to close all connections, but our local node will stop esponding to other peers, adding some reasonnable delay that will most of the time get unnoticed by others, just seeing some temporary latency). This would avoid loosing data and the need to reindex everything after a crash, notably on full nodes. And we could as well implement a watchdog to \"force\" the termination of worker threads that take too long (e.g. running for more than 20 minutes), if we have a way to cleanup their  memory allocated dynamically in the heap (and not on their stack where they are instantly garbage collected).\r\n",
