It is literally just burning money. While there are some applications where burning money is the point, I don't think we should really be encouraging/enabling those. Just because someone uses a particular feature does not mean it is necessarily good or worth keeping. Furthermore, I would not be surprised if many of those applications are burning money accidentally. A few developers I have spoken to were surprised that 0 value op_returns were allowed because they were not aware of the exception to the dust limit for op_returns. Application developers may have the same misconception.\r\n\r\n> wouldn't it make more sense to just have an option to prune this before saving it to disk?\r\n\r\nDisk space is not the concern. Whether the amount is 0 or something else doesn't matter, it still takes up the same amount of space. We're already pruning op_returns from the UTXO set. Rather the point is to add a protection for users. The purpose is to prevent users from accidentally burning money. In general, we should erect barriers to users throwing away their money as it is often done by accident.",

There are valid use cases for this.  This is broken in bitcoin 25.0 because to add the new argument would require changes to everything downstream of bitcoin core, including rust-bitcoincore-rpc, electrs, and electrum wallet.  It could theoretically be hacked in by having a default setting at the direct client of the bitcoin core rpc (rust-bitcoincore-rpc in this case), but this would be a hack.\r\n\r\nIt might make more sense to either remove this new argument or change the default to 21quadrillion sats.  This allows the downstream users to decide the level of \"protection\" they want vs prior bitcoin versions, rather than forcing the change on them.",

      "body" : "> rust-bitcoincore-rpc\r\n\r\n(Just picking the first example). This is also broken if you wanted to send 1BTC to fees, because the rust interface doesn't set any options, looking at the current code: https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoincore-rpc/blob/7bd815f1e1ae721404719ee8e6867064b7c68494/client/src/client.rs#L1081\r\n\r\nI don't think there is another solution other than to update the libraries and programs you are using when updating Bitcoin Core. Sure, if it is possible to avoid breaking the RPC interface, it should be considered. However, if there is a valid feature and it requires breaking the interface and reviewers are happy with that, I don't see why the feature should be held back or removed after a release.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is not supported to use a library or program that speaks a different RPC protocol than the version of Bitcoin Core you are using, and I don't think this is possible to achieve in general or should even be a goal to attempt.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about the RPC interface, you can also read the docs: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md#versioning",
