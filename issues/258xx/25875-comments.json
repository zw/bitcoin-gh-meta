This scope is not very well defined in terms of the codebase (it is important to note that the scopings of maintainers is based on actual code modules and not on abstract ideas).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, privacy can refer to many different things that are often not at all related to each other. For example, there is privacy in terms of the types of networks we use (e.g. Tor, I2P, etc.); there is node privacy in terms of leaking information about our mempool, etc.; there is wallet privacy in terms of not leaking information about other UTXOs in created transactions. None of these things have any overlap with each other other than that they involve the term \"privacy\". There is no shared practical skillset. Given the very wide range of things that \"privacy\" refers to, I also think it is not feasible to that any one person will be an expert in all of these things. It would be more appropriate to say \"Wallet privacy\" or \"P2P privacy\", but then really the scope is \"wallet\" and \"p2p\", not really \"privacy\".\r\n\r\n> Review a pull request for privacy impact before merging (p2p, mempool, wallet, RPC, GUI etc.)\r\n\r\nThis sounds like this maintainer would have to review every PR and have to ACK every PR before it gets merged? If so, that's really not a good idea. It would lead to centralization around a specific maintainer and potentially lead to a lot of conflict in the review process (e.g. a new feature that is not necessarily privacy preserving, but is also something that users are likely to want).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear to me what a privacy maintainer would actually be doing in terms of maintenance. We add new maintainers in order to **merge** code in specific areas because the current maintainers are not merging code in those areas. There is no \"privacy\" module for a privacy maintainer to merge code into. However If a privacy maintainer is just doing review, then they're just a reviewer, and anyone can post a review. Additionally, maintainers also do not have actionable power over other contributors or other maintainers. If a contributor violates the privacy of another contributor, what exactly is the privacy maintainer supposed to do?",
