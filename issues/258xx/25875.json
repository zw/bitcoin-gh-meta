   "body" : "@JeremyRubin opened an [issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25870) yesterday after IRC meeting however its related to P2P & Networking only with no submodules considered or a wider scope. \r\n\r\n### Why do we need a privacy maintainer?\r\n\r\n1. @sipa and @laanwj stepped down as maintainers recently. They were good at reviewing pull requests for privacy before merging.\r\n2. Existing maintainers are good at different parts of code (QA, Build, GUI, Wallet and Mempool) however I am not sure about privacy. \r\n3. Privacy of contributors is as important as privacy in bitcoin core. I was doxxed by a bitcoin core maintainer on GitHub, comment was deleted later although I expect better ethics and policies followed by bitcoin core maintainers.\r\n\r\n### What will be the role of a privacy maintainer?\r\n\r\n- Ensure privacy of contributors \r\n- Review a pull request for privacy impact before merging (p2p, mempool, wallet, RPC, GUI etc.)\r\n\r\nExamples of privacy related pull requests in bitcoin core:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18038\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13756\r\n\r\nExamples of privacy related roles and areas in different projects/companies:\r\n\r\nhttps://jobs.apple.com/en-in/details/200404681/privacy-software-engineer\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/blob/8a8328bd145b08259f7fde19fcad8f6c09168263/FRPs/active/FRP-10.md\r\n\r\n### Who qualifies for this role?\r\n\r\n- Passionate about privacy\r\n- Contributed in bitcoin core to improve privacy, other bitcoin projects and privacy in general\r\n- Being anon or living in a country that does not have weird regulations related to privacy would be better although not necessary\r\n\r\n### Nominees\r\n\r\nEveryone should be free to volunteer for this role as bitcoin core is an open source project and implementation used by 90% nodes for a censorship resistant network that can be used to settle payments.\r\n\r\n",
