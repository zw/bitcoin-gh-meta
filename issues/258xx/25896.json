   "body" : "This change prints a single additional line in the debug.log when bitcoin-cli loads a wallet using `loadwallet` (*not* `createwallet`).\r\n\r\nWhen Bitcoin Core creates a wallet, it's `minversion` is set to `FEATURE_BASE`, which is 10500. However, once the wallet is unloaded using `unloadwallet` or through program termination, and subsequently loaded again, `loadwallet` updates the `minversion` in the wallet.dat file to `FEATURE_LATEST`, currently 169900.\r\n\r\nThe current logging format prints the very old wallet version during `createwallet`, and then the actual version in calls to `loadwallet`. This has confused at least one person ([reference](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410650.0) - I was the one who asked there if there were plans to change that behavior, and was subsequently redirected here by achow), so it will be very helpful to users to explicitly specify in the logs what the walletdb is doing.",
