This seems a fine improvement.\r\n\r\nI think one way of looking at stalling is that it happens when one peer's bandwidth is less than 1/64th of the total bandwidth (64 = 1024/16 = window/max in transit) [0]. \r\n\r\nI think that means there might be a clever way of preventing slow nodes from stalling the download by reducing the in transit limit instead -- so that instead of supplying 16 blocks in the time it takes the other peers to supply 1008 to avoid stalling, the peer only needs to supply 8 or 4 blocks in the time it takes the other peers to supply 1016 or 1020. [1]\r\n\r\nI think adding the blocks only nodes probably made this slightly worse, since there are now 2 extra peers, so now you need something like 25% more bandwidth in order to still have 1/64th of the total...\r\n\r\n[0] Measured in blocks of course, so even if your bandwidth in bytes is fine, you might be unlucky to be asked for 16 blocks that are 2MB each, while everyone else is just being asked for 1008 50kB blocks at you (32MB total vs 7.2MB per peer).\r\n\r\n[1] Perhaps you could implement this by keeping a global and per-peer exponential rolling average of how many blocks you download per second; then you could set the peer's in-transit limit to `1024 * peer_avg / global_avg`; capping it at 16, and marking the peer as stalling and disconnecting if that value drops below 2 (in which case the remaining peers *each* have 50x this peer's bandwidth)?",

So we'd need some data structure to keep track of download times for not-yet-connected blocks and add/remove entries from it during IBD.\r\n\r\nIf we did this, it would help us cycle through less peers in situations where we assign multiple blocks to a peer and halving the timeout after successfully downloading a block would lead to a stalling situation again - but note that there are also other sources of disconnections that could be improved if we kept track of this kind data during IBD: E.g. if doubling the timeout is not sufficient and we'd need to 4x or 8x it.\r\n\r\nSo if we want something better but more complicated (with bookkeeping), my feeling is that we should go for another approach altogether, like basing the stalling timeout on a running average over the last received block times from multiple peers instead of a doubling/halving approach.\r\n",

[1]\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a very interesting alternative approach. I'm not sure I understand it completely though: Are you suggesting to assign slower peers less blocks simultaneously, to help prevent stalling situations from occurring in the first place? And also move away from the concept that a stalling situation occurs only when we can't move the 1024 block window forward, but make it dependent on the other peers instead, so that we'd possibly disconnect slow peers much earlier than that if they are slower in comparison to faster ones?\r\n",

      "body" : "> That sounds like a very interesting alternative approach.\r\n\r\nYeah, it shouldn't hold up this fix though, I think.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I understand it completely though: Are you suggesting to assign slower peers less blocks simultaneously, to help prevent stalling situations from occurring in the first place?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n> And also move away from the concept that a stalling situation occurs only when we can't move the 1024 block window forward, but make it dependent on the other peers instead, so that we'd possibly disconnect slow peers much earlier than that if they are slower in comparison to faster ones?\r\n\r\nNot really. I think you need to keep the 1024 block window (since increasing that hurts pruning), and I think that if the window gets full you should still call that \"stalling\".\r\n\r\nBut I think if you change the `MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER` so that slower peers have fewer in-transit blocks, then you'll be stalling much less often, and may not need to disconnect them at all -- that lets you stay connected to tor peers during IBD (for partition/sybil resistance) even if your ipv4/ipv6 peers are *much* faster. Maybe you could disconnect them when their `max_blocks_in_transit` drops to 1 or 2, before they actually cause stalling?\r\n\r\nMaybe a more specific example would be worthwhile. As it stands, if your first peer will give you one block every 5 seconds, and your other 9 peers will collectively give you 14 blocks every second (on average, 7.8 times faster than the first peer, in total 70 times faster), then by the time that first peer has downloaded blocks 1..15 (which takes 75 seconds), the other peers will have given you blocks 17..1039 after 73.1 seconds, and stalling gets triggered. But if the slow peer had only queued up 8 blocks, then it would have supplied them in 40 seconds, which only gives the other peers enough time to supply 560 blocks, so they won't fill up the window. Hmm, I guess it ought to be possible to simulate that scenario via the functional test's `P2PInterface` stuff...",

      "body" : "Addressed the test feedback (will get to the outstanding comment for the main commit a bit later).\r\n\r\n> * First test (should not stall):\r\n>   those `received: block...` messages in the log above (from the failure of the second test) are produced from the first test. The `sleep(0.5)` was apparently not enough, so I _fixed_ it to `sleep(5)` (just for testing, not to actually have it in the final test). This means that in practice it could stall and remain undetected by the first test because it will be happy to not see `Stall started` in the log even though it may be printed shortly after the first test has eagerly declared success. We want to check that there are 1023 `received: block` messages in the log and that afterwards the stalling logic from `SendMessages()` is executed and after that there is no \"Stall started\" in the log. I am not sure how to do that. Checking the bytes received for block messages seems to be better than the sleep, but could still end the wait too early.\r\n\r\nI rewrote the test such that it doesn't use the log anymore, but waits until all blocks are received, syncs (so that a peer could get mark as a staller), waits for 3s, syncs again (so that a peer could get disconnected), and then checks that no peer gets disconnected.\r\n\r\n> * Second test (should stall):\r\n>   it fails because there is no \"Stall started peer=0\" message. I added `sleep(10)` at the end of the `with...` block to wait even more for the stall. Then it fails with this error:\r\n\r\nI removed the `peer=0` part of the check and added a missing `self.all_sync_send_with_ping(peers)` to the `with` block. With that, the tests succeeds for me even with some slow sanitizers enabled - will do more runs over the weekend to check for intermittent failures.\r\n\r\n> I am ok to drop the test. It is good to have tests to ensure the code works as intended. But we can't have tests for everything and there is a subjective threshold somewhere. If it is too difficult to implement properly or is more complicated than the actual code it tests, then it may be too expensive. There is maintenance cost for the test too. Developers could trash precious time investigating a sporadically failing test, fixing it or trying to figure out whether their (seemingly unrelated) changes broke the test. I am not saying to drop the test, just that I would be ok with that.\r\n \r\nIf everyone agrees that would be ok with me. However, the stalling logic was completely untested before, which is not ideal, so the test doesn't just cover the changes from this PR. \r\n@dergoegge do you have an opinion, since you suggested the test? Do you think that the stalling logic could maybe better be covered by a unit test after #25515? (which would have less problems with timeouts).",
