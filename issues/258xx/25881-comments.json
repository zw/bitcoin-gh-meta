Since we decide which set to fetch new keypool keys from by using the feature flags, for such wallets we will not choose the internal keypool as the flags indicate that is not supported.

The code is quite entangled there.\r\n\r\nYou know, the legacy version of `ReturnDestination` should be checking whether the wallet is pre-split or not to return the key to the proper place as `ReserveKeyFromKeyPool` is doing.. and not just place it into the internal pool directly if the internal flag is true.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that looks like an existent bug is what happens when the wallet takes the last key from the pre-split keypool:\r\n\r\n1) `ReserveKeyFromKeyPool` will erase the last key index from `set_pre_split_keypool`. Leaving the set empty.\r\n2) As `set_pre_split_keypool` is empty, `ReturnDestination` will not return the index to `set_pre_split_keypool` and wrongly push it inside `setExternalKeyPool` (because before return the index into the pre-split set we are checking that the set is not empty).",

      "body" : "> @furszy what are the next steps here? This has two ACKs, but they can be discarded, given the issue pointed out by achow. Are you planning up updating this to drop that commit ([c880924](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c88092403d42d15714f6cd72a39528859c8c2725)), or follow up with different changes? If you're not actively working on this at the moment, do you want to turn this into a draft until it's ready for review again?\r\n\r\nyeah, IIRC I found an existent bug in the legacy wallet while was checking achow's comment (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25881#discussion_r953824206).\r\n\r\nWill move it to draft until I'm able to get back to it. I don't think that the other two cleanup commits alone worth enough to ping reviewers.",
