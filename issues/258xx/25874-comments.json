Apart from this, were you seeing valid connections with CJDNS peers? (you can check while your node is running using `bitcoin-cli -netinfo 4` or  `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo`).\r\n\r\n- Was it with the v23 release (binary or built from source?), or current master, or? Which platform/OS?\r\n\r\n- Which version of CJDNS are you running (`cjdns --version`)?\r\n",
