Here we go... this is a bug continued from ./configure when installing `brew install llvm` i get a string of this::\r\n```\r\n\r\n==> llvm: stable 14.0.6, HEAD [keg-only]\r\nNext-gen compiler infrastructure\r\nhttps://llvm.org/\r\nNot installed\r\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/llvm.rb\r\nLicense: Apache-2.0 with LLVM-exception\r\n==> Dependencies\r\nBuild: cmake â, swig â\r\nRequired: python@3.10 â, libffi â\r\n==> Options\r\n--HEAD\r\n\tInstall HEAD version\r\n==> Caveats\r\nTo use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:\r\n  LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nllvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,\r\nbecause macOS already provides this software and installing another version in\r\nparallel can cause all kinds of trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\ni feel like i am getting nowhere . still unable to configure the bitcoin/bitcoin git...... its heartwrenching, but I am trying diligently and patiently to fix my issues. is there something wrong with my mac itself. it is very old 2011..... over ten years old!! very outdated. running Mac OS 10.13.6\r\n\r\ndo i need to go ahead and use` brew info llvm `'s out put of /usr/local/opt/llvm/lib or what sense it is not symlinked... ?? and just use that LDFLAG as the path? it says it can't symlink? should i use the keg's path /usr/local/opt/llvm or the other, or will this cause problems. i will get this thing worked out eventually. just need a little nudge in the right direction one more time.",
