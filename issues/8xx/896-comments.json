      "body" : "Looks good to me!\r\n\r\nNote that this isn't exactly an attack on old nodes though. Unless it's increased recently, under half of all blocks mined are from P2SH nodes, which means that they'd probably be the ones that would be most affected by the Bitcoin network attempting to partition itself into old and new nodes in this way. Then there's the issue of giving an attacker a tool that helps them create a network partition with a useful proportion of miners on each side in the first place.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if a similar issue will apply to blocks after P2SH is switched on fully; could they cause the P2SH part of the network to cut itself off from the non-P2SH part?",
