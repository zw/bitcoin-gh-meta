If that's empty, we stay in the same bucket and go from randomly_picked_position to the end of the bucket. If haven't found anything, pick bucket+position randomly again.\r\n\r\n\r\n>That does mean that if a bucket has fewer entries, its entries are supposed to be picked more frequently.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good intuitive high-level justification of the proposed change.\r\n\r\nSo, I don't think this can be directly exploited at least easily (because we randomly hash), but it just makes the connectivity better overall, for a given node (and perhaps for the network overall)?\r\nSince a bucket is a means of diversification, making them all equal makes sense.\r\n\r\nBut also, after this change, ending up in a less-populated bucket is \"luckier\" for that node. That probably evens out across all nodes in the network, so that should be fine.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "Thanks @sipa for clarifying. Its natural that if probability of a bucket being chosen is `P(bucket)` and it has `n` addresses, then probability of a particular address being picked from a particular bucket is `P(bucket) / n`. That satisfies your example above.\r\n\r\nBut to me, that doesn't seem like satisfying your above statement, \" if a bucket has fewer entries, its entries are supposed to be picked more frequently.\"\r\n\r\nBecause bucket choices are uniformly random, for `m` non-empty buckets, probability of a particular bucket being chosen is `1/m`. And, then because the search ensures that a non-empty bucket will always yield an address, so probability of getting **any** address from that bucket is `1`. \r\n\r\nFollowing this logic, we have, for `m` buckets, probability that **any** address from a particular bucket to be chosen is always `1/m`, uniformly distributed over all the buckets, and independent of size of buckets.\r\n\r\nSo mapping back to your example, it would say, probability of choosing an address from Bucket A == Probability of choosing an address from Bucket B == 50%. The address count doesn't play a role anymore, because we will always choose an address from a bucket if it has any.\r\n\r\nTo compare against the old code:  \r\nIn the old code, the probability is uniformly distributed across all addresses, irrespective of their buckets. \r\nIn the new code the probability is now uniformly distributed over all buckets, irrespective of their contents.\r\n\r\nOnce the bucket is chosen, then there is no probability anymore, as we will always get an address from it if its not empty.\r\n\r\nThus to me it seems like the probability is independent of bucket size.

      "body" : "When we learn of a new address from a source peer, I believe we essentially:\r\n\r\n- select 64 of the 1024 new buckets based on the source peer's netgroup\r\n- then select the specific bucket out of those 64 based on the destination's netgroup\r\n- then select the bucket position (out of 64) based on the destination's network address (and the bucket index)\r\n\r\nThat means that if we have one or more source peers that are filling up our new table with addresses, each one will be able to fill up to 64 new buckets with 64 addresses each (4096 addresses).\r\n\r\nThis proposed change means that if a minority of source peers are sending a disproportionately high number of address records, the addresses that they're providing won't get disproportionately chosen by Select(). I think it also means that we're more likely to try to connect to addresses that we learn about via self-broadcast gossiping from inbound nodes than currently. I expect that (initially at least) our new tables are dominated by addresses that we learn from DNS seeds or from getaddr responses, but that those records are concentrated into specific buckets. by selecting bucket first, then position, we're more likely to select from an under-filled bucket, which would have been populated by address gossip.\r\n\r\nThose seems like good changes to me.\r\n\r\nWhen we promote an address to the tried table, we:\r\n\r\n- select 8 of the 256 buckets based on the destination's netgroup\r\n- then select the specific bucket based on the destination's network address\r\n- then select the bucket position based on the destination's network address (and the bucket index)\r\n\r\nThat means that if we successfully connect to a peer in an under-represented netgroup, it'll be placed in a more sparsely-populated tried bucket than if we successfully connect to a peer in a more common netgroup. With this change, we're more likely to choose that address again when Select() is called. If this change is applied to nodes across the network, then nodes on less well represented netgroups will receive slightly more inbound requests on average than those on common netgroups.\r\n\r\nSo, changing the way that Select() picks entries from the new and tried tables does two slightly different things:\r\n\r\n1. for the new tables, it means that each address source netgroup is (closer to) equally likely to be picked. That's an improvement because we'll no longer favour addresses from spammy address sources.\r\n2. for the tried tables, it means that each destination netgroup is (closer to) equally like to be be picked, but this is only for addresses that we've connected to at some point in the past.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can understand, the justification for the PR describes (2), but I think (1) is far more significant, since there are always more entries in the new tables, and because for feeler connections we only select from the new tables.",

The logic in `ThreadOpenConnections` prevents us from making multiple outbound connections to peers in the same network group.\r\n\r\n@sipa - what do you think about removing the change to picking a tried entry, and only having this logic for picking a new entry?",
