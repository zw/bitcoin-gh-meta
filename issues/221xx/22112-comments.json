Looks like I2P addresses are more precious than a random one from an addrman filled mostly with IPv4 addresses.\r\n\r\n* If `addnode=foo.b32.i2p` is specified (without port) then we would do something like `Lookup(str, GetDefaultPort())` and would end up with `CService` with address `foo.b32.i2p` and port `8333` which is not what we want (we want port `0`) (thanks, @jonatack for discovering this!).
