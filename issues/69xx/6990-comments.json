      "body" : "> event_base_loopbreak was not doing what I expected it to. What I expected was that it sets a timeout, given that no other pending events it would exit in N seconds. However, what it does was delay the event loop exit with N seconds, even if nothing is pending.\r\n\r\n~~Sounds like you wanted `event_base_loopexit`? Ref:~~\r\n\r\n> The next event_base_loop() iteration after the given timer expires will complete normally (handling all queued events) then exit without blocking for events again.\r\n\r\n~~In any case, `event_base_loopbreak` should still exit immediately, stopping any `loop`s after the next event:~~\r\n\r\n> event_base_loop() will abort the loop after the next event is completed; event_base_loopbreak() is typically invoked from this event's callback. This behavior is analogous to the \"break;\" statement.\r\n\r\nAre you sure this isn't symptomatic of something else?\r\n\r\nReference: http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-2.0/doxygen/html/event_8h.html#a07a7599e478e4031fa8cf52e26d8aa1e\r\n\r\n**edit**: Right, never mind, you were using `event_base_loopexit`, hence the confusion.  You're OP (before it was edited) makes it sound like you switched from `event_base_loopbreak`.",

Also, timing events (such as the `walletpassphrase` timeout) may hold up the event queue.\r\n\r\n- Just breaking off everything in progress immediately prevents the answer to `stop` from getting back. We could just declare this a feature of course and be done with it... But it was a race condition, sometimes you would get a reply, sometimes not.

So conceptually, the status quo could be the same?\r\n\r\nIt does:\r\n```\r\n        // Unlisten sockets\r\n        BOOST_FOREACH (evhttp_bound_socket *socket, boundSockets) {\r\n            evhttp_del_accept_socket(eventHTTP, socket);\r\n        }\r\n        // Reject requests on current connections\r\n        evhttp_set_gencb(eventHTTP, http_reject_request_cb, NULL);\r\n```\r\nThis closes the port and makes new requests error (so that no new work items are created). But that's best-effort. Current connections could still do e.g. a slowloris attack. The two seconds are a belt and suspenders, nothing more.\r\n",
