   "body" : "This changes the VM environment for gitian building to use Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty).\r\n\r\n- Changes compiler version from GCC 4.6 to GCC 4.8, which makes #6211 (using the relevant subset of c++11) possible, and probably results in better code\r\n- Removes some 12.04 specific cruft from descriptors\r\n- The security and symbol checks pass (symbol check reports `clock_gettime`, but this is the same for old descriptors thus unrelated)\r\n-  Linux and OSX and Windows output is deterministic\r\n\r\nKnown problems:\r\n\r\n### ~~Windows build is not deterministic~~\r\n**SOLVED**\r\n\r\nEvery link, a few bytes in the executable near the end of `.rodata` are different. These are not a timestamp but apparently random.\r\n\r\nI spent some time tracking this down, eventually used a linker map to find that the bytes come from a ephermal object `ertr000001.o`. This helped trace this problem to the function `pe_create_runtime_relocator_reference` in `binutils/ld/pe-dll.c` which leaks a few bytes of heap to the executable by writing uninitialized data (!).\r\n\r\nThis sounds serious, however apparently this was already solved by the Erinn Clark of the Tor project in 2013: https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16192 . Awesome.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Ubuntu hasn't included the new binutils in 14.04... @theuni any idea how to handle this? Tor, for a while, manually patched the bytes (well not manually I suppose - in a postprocessing step). Another option would be to use our own binutils, or use an even newer image (but that wouldn't be long term supported).\r\n",
