      "body" : "@laanwj thats a pretty dangerous suggestion (and the risk of miners doing that was a reason we considered leaving out out those RPCs in the first place)... because in the common case that the fork you heard first was the actual longer one if your software screws up and you fail to revalidate it, you'll continue on forking the network.\r\n\r\nThe normal reason for asks like this is because of a high-ish hashpower miner who found a tying block moments after they had already accepted a first longer block from the network (due to hardware and submission delays); and rather than accept their defeat gracefully they'd like to attempt a momentary majority hashpower attack and try to get lucky excluding the other block.   If you simulate this behavior of selfishly mining on your own later blocks, for many hashrate distributions and latency choices it gives _massively_ worse convergence times for the network. (I think for a toy example of two 50% miners and a 30 second submission latency it increased the frequency of 6+ deep reorgs 100 fold or something insane like that)\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better to focus more on cutting down on the submission latency side of it, since asking miners to not behave in a way thats adversarial towards the network may not be sustainable-- but historically many hardware vendors have not cared too much about eliminating these latencies.

No-- I didn't say they shouldn't have been done, but rather we put them in knowing that the network was currently vulnerable to at the time non-public forking vulnerability (the one that just split PPC recently) and I was concerned that given the difficulty of contacting miners and the problems with reindexing that happened with the March 2013 fork we needed a tool available that would allow switching forks manually without reindexing, but couldn't even disclose the need.  Turns out they're _super_ useful for testing too.  \r\n\r\nBut now that they've been suggested for overriding the fastest convergence behavior that suggestion can't be taken back, and we need to provide a safe way of doing that (preferblock), because doing it via invalidate is not generally safe. Thats all, no big deal. Even 'preferblock' is not all that safe: as I mention, in many network typologies preferring your own blocks over tied earlier ones has really bad impacts on convergence; but we can't stop people from doing that. We can at least reduce provide a way that limits the harm to an increase in large reorgs rather than outright network forking.\r\n\r\nIn the case of f2pool, their bitcoind was on the correct chain; but other mining software which did not enforce any network validity rules was ignoring it and extending another chain because it had more blocks. This didn't help there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is because in a near tie the winning block doesn't just have to win early enough to overcome network and validation latency and be heard uniformly before a competitor, it has to to that by more than the mining stack latency (which can be rather large). When that doesn't happen the fork persists when it otherwise would have resolved, and the result is a longer reorg. The effect is as big as it is, due to the exponential distribution of times between blocks means that a lot of blocks are 'fast'.\r\n\r\nThe comment here was not on that but that now that breaking ties with invalidation was suggested I think we really need to provide a better interface or get rid of the dangerous one---- we probably should have all along but it hadn't come up; even though it hurts convergence people will do it anyways and they might as well do it safely.  Though possible to do via invalidateblock it is quite tricky to get that right, and the result will be miners that refuse to mine on the longest chain even once theirs has fallen behind (e.g. due to state management and details like if they've invalidated they won't even see the longer extension, so they won't know they've fallen behind and will continue to try to mine a fork), which will leave lite clients more vulnerable to double spending and create other issues.  Since it sounds like people are going to do that we should provide an option (preferblock) which is less likely to shoot miners (and the network as a whole) in the foot and completely break things. :)\r\n",
