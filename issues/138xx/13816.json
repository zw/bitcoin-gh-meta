   "body" : "This pull requests enables building and running the project with `os: osx`, sort of natively on os x instead of cross-compiling and not running the tests.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that the `before_install`, `install`, `before_script`, and `script` parts were externalized into `.travis/before_install` etc. These scripts exist for both `linux` (which runs everything in docker) and `osx` (which runs everything directly).\r\n\r\nHaving the steps externalized in individual scripts makes them more readable and subject to `shellcheck` (`lint-shell.sh`).\r\n\r\nThe `shellcheck` executable segfaults on me, which is why it's now being run via docker. This has a nice side effect, namely that a more recent version of shellcheck can be used. The runtime of the lint step is not affected to much by it (it's still around 1 minute as it was before).\r\n\r\nThe newer shellcheck also comes with more lint rules of which I disabled some as I did not want to touch too much stuff in this single pull request, which is primarily about a reorganization of the travis build.",
