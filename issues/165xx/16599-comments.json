Eventually we may want to bundle a map with Bitcoin Core or even make it part of the binary if this approach turns out to be useful.\n\nI wasn't aware of that publicly available GeoLite2 database; that looks useful to experiment with.

In order to avoid Western bias we'd need to do it across geographic regions and from many vantage points (eg maybe contact a Tier 1 and get their full routing table view, not just the selected routes), but once we get the infrastructure in place, further filtering can be played with.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to `traceroute` some of the nodes we connect to and re-bucket based on the ASNs of the first couple of hops?

      "body" : "So there are two parts to this proposal:\r\n- Use ASN information for addrman bucketing.\r\n- Use ASN information for determining which peers to connect to.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that using ASN information for addrman bucketing is likely to be very beneficial, as it prevents being blinded to peers outside of (eg) ASNs that an attacker might want to divert traffic towards.  I figure we should be able to make addrman large enough (if it's not already) that the increased collisions for AS's that have more nodes should not be a big problem.\r\n\r\nBut it's less clear to me if enforcing ASN-diversity on our outbound peers is beneficial or not, as it might drive connections to a relatively small part of the overall network graph.  For instance if there is an ASN with only 1 node (A) in it, and let's say there are a couple hundred ASNs in total with any nodes at all (fair assumption?), then rather than having a ~1 in 10000 chance of A being selected by a node making an outbound connection, A's chances will be more like 1 in a couple hundred.  This could have unfortunate side effects for other network-graph attacks (and EREBUS might even be easier in some situations as a result, since that attack revolves around using any AS for which the victim would route through the adversary's network to reach).  So this seems like a potentially large effect that I think would be worthy of more careful study before deploying.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach might be to just aim for node diversity at the addrman level (using ASN information if available, as suggested here), and then use peer rotation or frequent chain-tip-sync with random peers (like #16859) in order to reduce the likelihood of being eclipsed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I realized I missed the IRC conversation on this, which I just read.  I did misunderstand the sampling effect of randomly sampling from all of addrman, as we do now with our existing /16 group limit, and presumably we would also do if we were to enforce an ASN connection limit as well.  Still, this seems to me like something we should model and study before deployment, as it's not clear at all to me what effect this would have on the network topology.  AS-diversity of our immediate peers is not clearly the thing we should be trying to maximize; if for instance dishonest peers can gain a connectivity advantage by locating themselves in small AS groups, that seems potentially problematic.",

I think we can agree that in terms of the physical level, this is an improvement.\r\n\r\nAsmap might make it worse if an attacker manages to spin up fake AS, but that can be handled upon asmap file distribution.\r\n\r\n### Logical level\r\nAny diversification makes certain nodes (placed in rare /16 groups or rare ASes) more likely to be chosen for connection.\r\nThis might make topology look less like a random graph. This is generally not a good sign, as it creates weakly connected components, which are easier to attack. \r\nThe effect on topology be represented by the variation of (AS/netgroup)->nodes] distribution. \r\nIn practice, however, salted hashing + bucketing makes the effect of the uneven distribution less noticeable.
