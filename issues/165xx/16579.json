   "body" : "I currently tried upgrading Bitcoin Core to v0.18 and it filled up by primary drive somehow. I had previously had it configured to store the database on my primary harddrive and the blockchain on a secondary drive. It clearly has messed with that config. Looking at my configuration file, its just empty. And the blockchain is not being stored at %APPDATA%/Bitcoin (I'm on windows 7), so I have no idea where its going. \r\n\r\nHaving a way to select where to store the blockchain is critical now that the chain is so huge. I don't want to put that thing on my primary drive that only has 225GB total. Yes I can edit the config file, but that's not user friendly. This is an important option and should be exposed where an unsophisticated user can change it. It would also help me if I could see where this thing is putting the blockchain so I don't have to an hour of my life looking for a suspiciously large directory.",
