   "body" : "There's a wallet safety feature, configurable via `-txmaxfee`, that refuses to create transactions with a fee above 0.1 BTC. This PR lowers that to 0.01 BTC.\r\n\r\nThe highest priority fee in 2017 was about 1000 satoshi per vbyte. A transaction with 6 legacy inputs and 3 outputs is about 1000 vbyte. Such a transaction is still possible with the lower `-txmaxfee` default.\r\n\r\nThe current value was decided in late 2014. In terms of several popular fiat currencies the highest seen price has increased by over a factor 10. Similarly the lowest seen price in two years is ~10x higher than the lowest price in 2014.\r\n\r\nOf course we can't predict the future and shouldn't be changing this number too often.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario I can think of would be a high fee low price scenario where GUI users are suddenly forced to edit the config file. This could be mitigated by making settings easier to edit (#12833).\r\n\r\nAnother factor to consider is the potential for very large coin joins, which are becoming more feasible recently. In that case we could just consider fees from our own inputs rather than the full transaction. \r\n\r\nSee also #16257 which reduced the likeness of accidental `-maxtxfee` spends, which [do happen](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions?q=fee(10000000)#). This PR reduces the damage is if it happens in some other way.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1185\" alt=\"feees\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/62396197-cd7e0c80-b572-11e9-9ef5-aa8745d8bfd7.png\">",
