   "body" : "This is an improvement to a test, inspired by #14343 - removing non determinism from a test.\r\n\r\nThe test `descriptor_test` is non-deterministic, as it relies on the `MaybeUseHInsteadOfApostrophy` function which randomly either swaps all apostrophes with 'h' or doesn't at all in a descriptor. This fix makes both cases always run, if an apostrophe is found in a test descriptor.\r\nThis does not reduce test coverage but removes the non-determinism.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `MaybeUseHInsteadOfApostrophy` function removed the checksum if found at the end of a descriptor when the apostrophes are swapped by 'h's, since after being swapped the checksum is no longer correct. I instead added re-calculation of the checksum using the `DescriptorChecksum` function, which adds coverage for the case of a descriptors having 'h's instead of apostrophes and a checksum. This was previously lacking.\r\nTo achieve this I had to move `DescriptorChecksum` and `PolyMod` out of the anonymous namespace in descriptor.cpp to make `DescriptorChecksum` accessible in descriptor_tests.cpp.\r\n\r\nAll tests complete successfully (functional as well as unit tests).",
