   "body" : "Nowadays every popular app has a fancy design. I think the designers of the bitcoin client made a great job at doing a design which functions well and easy to use, it is already much better than the initial version.\r\n\r\nAlthough I see that there is space for improvements, and I honestly believe that design does matter if we want to reach the masses.\r\n\r\nMy proposition is that I will donate $300 for this, if you are willing to go for a new design at 99Designs.com \r\n(http://99designs.com/mobile-app-design).\r\n\r\nHere we can have 50+ design ideas for $599+ and choose only the one which we (the BitCoin community) likes the best. This design could be used then for both desktop and (future) mobile clients.\r\n\r\nI haven't contacted 99Designs yet, but I would like to know if you guys are interested in this, and if you are open to extend my donation with $299 to make this happen.",
