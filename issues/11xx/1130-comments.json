      "body" : "I remember someone once mentioned that such stack randomization is even optimized away by recent compilers, so I had at a look at the generated code. My assembly-fu is not that good, but from what I understand, ThreadMessageHander for example is compiled to not more than a strangely-ordered loop. A form of tail-recursion optimization, I assume. It's easy to avoid this optimization, by adding a effectful statement after the recursive call in the IMPLEMENT_RANDOMIZE_STACK, but given that we also use -fstack-protector already, maybe we can drop this construct altogether?",
