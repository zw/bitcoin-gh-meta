      "body" : "Actually, not every use of `char` needs to be changed.  Cases where `char` refers to the characters of a human-readable string should be left as-is (since things like `open` use `const char *`).\r\n\r\nI searched for every instance of `char`, and skipped anything that looked like it was just ordinary string handling.  GCC was helpful, because it gave warnings where `>= 0` checks were being done on an unsigned `char` variable.  Admittedly, I used my intuition to make that call.  I'm more familiar with C than I am with C++, and I'm not extremely familiar with the Bitcoin codebase.  You're right that this might not solve the entire issue, but I think it's a useful step.\r\n\r\nIt might be useful for other developers to use `-funsigned-char` on x86 and see if they get the results they expect.  I tried that and it seems to work fine, but I didn't exercise it too hard.  bitcoind still segfaults after a while when downloading the block chain when I emulate armel using qemu-user, but it also complains about some unsupported syscall number, so I suspect the crash has more to do with qemu than with bitcoind.  (Unfortunately, I don't have real ARM hardware to test on at the moment.)\r\n\r\nAs for serialization, I wouldn't expect too many problems, because the difference between signed `char` and unsigned `char` is mostly irrelevant except for comparisons, or when casting to larger types like `int`.  Cases where a character is used as the *index* for a look-up table already work, because x86's `char` is signed by default (so it would have already been broken if it wasn't declared properly).\r\n\r\nMy motivation for this patch is to get the latest bitcoind package into Debian testing.  Right now, they're [stuck at 0.3.24](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=bitcoind) due to some [build issues](https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=bitcoin&suite=sid) on some architectures, so I've been submitting bug reports with the necessary patches to try to get this resolved.\r\n\r\nIf you want, I can check this more carefully over the weekend.  Pointers to potentially problematic areas not covered by the test suite would be helpful, in that case.",
