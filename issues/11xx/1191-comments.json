I'm inclined to think it could fit in easily to the existing network (via BIP). Although I think the current version system advertised amongst peers is not ideal for future feature expansion. I think something in the form of flags would be better. The number 60000 takes up 16 bits of information. I wonder whether a new version/flag system implemented, via the BIP process, where each bit could correspond to a function of that peer, might offer better expansion abilities.",

Also, several proposals and implementations already exist: Electrum, BCCAPI, bitcoin-js, and maybe even bitcoind's RPC protocol.\r\n\r\nAlso, when new node-specific features are added to the protocol, they can use the nServices flag. As this is information propogated along with peer exchange, it is much more useful to potential peers. No need to put that in the version number.",

You are re-hashing ideas that were already proposed on the forum and mailing list more than a year ago. Some people are working very hard on those. I don't see it necessary to duplicate their effort. There's enough to do to make the perfect and stable full node, which is IMO what the Satoshi client should be focusing on.\r\n\r\nDesign-wise a bitcoin client can be split into three components:\r\n\r\n    1 frontend <-> 2 wallet <-> 3 P2P blockchain client \r\n\r\nElectrum is a client with just the frontend and the wallet, and has the P2P blockchain client in so-called supernodes (which AFAIK run Satoshi client). It doesn't use the P2P protocol for the communication from wallet to blockchain client, but something called Stratum (see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=55842.0). It makes sense to use different protocols for different concerns.\r\n\r\nNext time, please only file a \"blue sky idea\" issue if it is really considered an issue (after discussion on the maling list, for example), or you are committing to implementing it yourself. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but to me it feels like bitcoin's issue list is turning into a discussion forum lately.\r\n\r\n",
