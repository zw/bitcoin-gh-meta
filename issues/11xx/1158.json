This would be useful for changing the configuration but without experiencing too much downtime, testing, etc.\r\n\r\nA standard used by many programs would be to make the software re-parse the config file upon receiving a HUP signal. This would work on unix systems, but on Windows, some other standard is presumably available to triggering this.",
