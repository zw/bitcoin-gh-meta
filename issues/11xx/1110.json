This needs technical knowledge which the potentially mainstream user doesn't have.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to do these steps for the user during installation or at the first start of the client.\r\n\r\nWindows has a common place to set these at Control Panel/Default Programs/Set Associations (Vista),\r\nbut all the major browsers have their own methods as well.\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\nhttp://kb.mozillazine.org/Register_protocol\r\nhttp://ecdsa.org/bitcoin_URIs.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't tested those methods yet, but I can confirm that after installing and starting the BitCoin Client 0.6, none of the following browsers could handle BitCoin URIs:\r\nChrome 18.0, Firefox 9.0.1, Firefox 10.0.2, Firefox 11.0 and IE 9.0.",
