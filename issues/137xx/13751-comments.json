      "body" : "That's a fair point @MarcoFalke Ã°ÂÂÂ \r\n\r\nThe goal was not to re-implement boost. This is an attempt to drop the `boost::split` dependency with as little changes to the existing codebase as possible.\r\n\r\nI have eliminated boost where it was trivial to do: `boost::algorithm::is_any_of` has been refactored to a `std::string` and `boost::algorithm::trim_right` to a `std::string:erase`.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to simplify this function:  e.g. no support for both `std::vector` and `std::set`; no support for `boost::token_compress_on`.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to go there initially, because I didn't want to break things and ease review by providing something that is straightforward to validate. Right now it is easy to swap the `boost::split` and `Split` functions in the unit test to validate if the external behaviour of `Split` still works as expected.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't have strong opinion on this. I am happy to make changes where needed; or close the pull request if this is not what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nI just hope I haven't messed up Ã°ÂÂÂ\r\n",

      "body" : "Hey, thanks @laanwj!\r\n\r\nYeah, good point. \r\n\r\nI had been thinking about this a while back when @sipa and @practicalswift hinted at the same, but didn't see an easy non-invasive way to do this, because the code that uses `boost::split` relies on specific external behaviour that`std::vector<Span<const char>> Split(const Span<const char>& sp, char sep)` doesn't provide.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. `torcontroller.cpp` expects the result in a `std::set<std::string>` instead of `std::vector<std::string>`;\r\n2. `httprpc.cpp` depends on `boost::split`'s capability to split on different separators;\r\n3. `core_read.cpp` depends on `boost::split`'s capability to merge adjacent separators\r\n\r\nRight now, the refactor seems trivial enough, because only the `boost::split` calls had to be replaced with calls to a custom function with identical external behaviour (as asserted by the unit tests, which can also be ran with the original `boost::split` function). No other code had to be refactored. \r\n\r\nDropping split from this pull request and trying to make the codebase work with `std::vector<Span<const char>> Split(const Span<const char>& sp, char sep)` seems very invasive, but maybe I am missing something obvious.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, one split function could use the other one, e.g. `std::vector<Span<const char>> Split(const Span<const char>& sp, char sep)` from `descriptor` could use `template<typename ContainerT>void Split(ContainerT& tokens, const std::string& str, const std::string& anyOfSeparator, bool mergeEmpty = false)` from this pull request.\r\n\r\nI am not sure about the options here.
