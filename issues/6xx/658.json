Then overnight when mining.bitcoin.cz hit my threshold and sent out a reward my BC QT 0.5.0 client crashed (sorry but I deleted the crash report in OSX).  Now I restarted BC QT but it had to completely resync with the P2P network and is now (6 hours later) hung up and not resyncronizing. My wallet shows zero balance.  If I can reproduce I will report the crash log here.  OK?  OK.",
