They're going to think size = quantity of BTC.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't really make any sense to me either.  i only have one key in use, it's not making up a bigger transaction from multiple coins.  There's no change.  I would have thought this is about the smallest transaction possible.\r\n\r\nSo the message is confusing to a new user, and also pretty much incorrect, unless the \"size limit\" is seen as something dynamic which depends on the amount being transferred and the age of the coins involved.",
