      "body" : "This change would make it impossible to have a node that processes no unconfirmed transactions for security/resource usage purposes, but which still has peers which are whitelisted for the purpose of bypassing anti-DOS/resource-limits to increase reliability... which should be a standard config for a border node in front of a service that doesn't need unconfirmed transactions.\r\n\r\nThis is a case where we're suffering from white-listing being overloaded to mean multiple things.  Is there actually a use case for accepting transactions when we're otherwise configured to not accept transactions at all?\r\n\r\nRegardless, I think this is going in the wrong direction: we should be narrowing the definition of whitelisting so that users can make more use of it, not widening it so that they can't.",
