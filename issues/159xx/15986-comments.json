And in fact, there has to be SOME way to get private keys echoed back, if you want to be able to get checksums for descriptors with private keys included.\r\n\r\nSo I'd advocate for this PR the way it is, but if people aren't comfortable with it, I'd suggest adding a flag, and not echoing descriptors with private keys unless the flag is set.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(Tagging #15740 for the record.)",

But I do agree with @gwillen's point: \r\n>the only way to get a private key in the output, is if you include it in the input.\r\n\r\nI find the extra  `with_checksum` confusing. Maybe we can add an argument `keep_private_keys` which defaults to `false`. I would also prefer sticking to canonical form (but with private keys). An additional argument `canonical` can be `true` by default. I know it makes the change a bit more complicated, but it seems more robust in the long run.",
