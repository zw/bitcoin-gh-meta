   "body" : "The current sample systemd script sets 0710 permissions on `/etc/bitcoin` which means it can only be read by the owner. If `/etc/bitcoin` does not exist when the systemd script is run for the first time then the directory gets created with `root` as the owner. The 0710 permissions will/may prevent a non-root user from being able to list the directory (on Ubuntu 18.04 the file can be listed but the permissions are inaccessible).\r\n\r\nEven after copying `bitcoin.conf` to `/etc/bitcoin` it will remain unusable until either the directory permissions are changed or the service user is made the owner.\r\n\r\nThis PR adjusts the permissions that the service script will set on `/etc/bitcoin` so that all users can read and list the default config directory. A user will still have to copy the bitcoin.conf file to it but the adjustment will avoid them having to manually set permissions or change ownership of `/etc/bitcoin`.\r\n\r\nIn addition the `ProtectHome` option has been added. The rationale being if using a service to run bitcoind it's more likely to be a headless daemon that should not need access to user home directories.\r\n\r\nBest link I found for systemd [options].(https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ConfigurationDirectory=)",
