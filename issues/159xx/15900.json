   "body" : "When starting `bitcoin-qt` with `-noconnect` or equivalently `-connect-0`, I expected the network activity icon in bottom right of the main windows to be in the `Network activity disabled`, with the `X` icon.\r\n  \r\nThe network activity indicator has its active icon instead, while correctly reporting `0 active connections to Bitcoin network`.\r\n\r\nI can always reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nInstalled Bitcoin Core is version 0.17.1.0-gef70f9b52b851c7997a9f1a0834714e3eebc1fd8 (64-bit) from http://ppa.launchpad.net/bitcoin/bitcoin/ubuntu PPA.\r\n \r\nThe operating system is elementary OS 5.0 on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U, disk type is a SSD SATA2.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\nThe network enabled status should be unified with the `connect` command line parameter.\r\n\r\nSince the latter is not a boolean flag but a list of IP address and considering the behavior of `InterpretNegatedOption()`, I figure setting the network activity status to false if `connect` `0` could be enough.",
