This PR clearly doesn't offer those benefits or meet that bar. Much of the feedback in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14837 also applies here.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK",

I opened the PR because if anyone in the future has an interest in looking at this logic, perhaps because they are adding a new script flag, I would point them towards perhaps doing this refactor first if the logic becomes especially complex. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving a PR open means that if someone touches this function DrahBot will automatically warn the conflict, allowing a reviewer to check it out as well even if they don't search. \r\n\r\nAnother possible outcome from this would be to turn this version of the code into a comment, which details that the semantics of the following code should be equivalent to the comment flow.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this, and a reason why you should spend your time to review it, is that it passes the test suite. If you think there is a risk that this code couldn't have identical semantics, you could write a test demonstrating that which would help protect us from errors made down the line when there are changes adding a feature rather than behavior less refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for benchmarking -- I don't necessarily suspect that the current version is slow, but perhaps now this gives me a reason to write a benchmark which can test master as well (I didn't write this one with performance in mind, just clarity). That benchmark can help prevent regression in the future. ",
