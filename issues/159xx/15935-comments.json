The settings file is supposed to replace some [`QSettings`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html) uses in `bitcoin-qt`, implementing type-safe persistent storage, and sharing this functionality with `bitcoind`, so settings modified at runtime will be stored in a common place regardless of whether you're using the GUI or a plain RPC interface. (You can see in 0ab41dd770c1f13983df528b111cfc8a51fe016a from #15936 how this works in the GUI or in 04c80c40df9fc6f4734ba238ea7f65607cf88089 from #15937 how this can be used in an RPC.)\r\n\r\n> this is redundant with #11082 which is a better solution.\r\n\r\nEvery solution has some tradeoffs, and I'm sure you can elaborate more on advantages of #11082 compared to this. But here are what I see as nice things about this approach:\r\n\r\n- Standard format. The `bitcoin.conf` format works pretty well as a manual configuration mechanism. But the format is unspecified and unstable, and less appealing for use as persistent key/value store compared to JSON which is well understood and supported by many tools and libraries.\r\n\r\n- Uniformity of representation. Since `bitcoin.conf` files are meant to be written by people and parsed by software, it's reasonable for them to provide many ways to do things like represent true/false values (`foo=1` `foo=` `foo=23` `foo=-1`, `nofoo=0` for true / `foo=0` `nofoo=1` `foo=false` for false), or to strip whitespace. But for a file that is meant to be round-trip read and written by software, only accepting plain `true` `false` keywords as bools and not mangling strings is a better way to avoid complexity, configuration errors, and software bugs.\r\n\r\n- Flexibility of representation. `bitcoin.conf` format can't currently represent strings with pound (`#`) or newline characters or strings with various types of whitespace. It can also only awkwardly represent lists by repeating settings (so there is no distinction between a non-list value and a single-element list). I think these things are likely to cause bugs, unnecessary limitations, headaches, and extra boilerplate in application-level code that reads and writes settings.\r\n\r\n- Maintainability. JSON for all that's good and bad about it is stable and usable enough and isn't going to change. Even writing this PR didn't require adding new parsing or formatting code. By contrast, #11082 not only adds new code right now to parse and generate `bitcoin_rw.conf` files, but will also require more work on an ongoing basis whenever the `bitcoin.conf` format is extended, because any new change will now require roundtrip support. (For example if we added an escaping mechanism it would require new code to escape values in addition to new code parsing escapes.)\r\n\r\nThis PR is also not mutually exclusive with #11082. I don't know exactly what features you wanted to implement on top of #11082, but if you are thinking of new features different from #15936 and #13937 that call for injecting settings into a human-edited config file, nothing in this PR should get in the way of that.\r\n\r\nThere were some other issues I had with #11082 when I reviewed it (adding a new `bitcoin.conf` parser instead of extending the existing one, and concerns about init order and inconsistent interpretation of network sections in `bitcoin.conf` and `bitcoin_rw.conf`), but those issues were specific to the implementation and not inherent to the approach.",

I'm using \"config\" there to refer to static configuration and \"settings\" to refer to dynamic configuration (based on bitcoin.conf, which is static, and QSettings, which is dynamic, in current code).\r\n\r\nMy thought is that more advanced command-line / linux type users will want to sit down and write out their configurations in text files with comments, but less advanced users will not be editing text files and will be happy if preferences they set through gui or rpc interfaces are just persisted in a simple format without support for comments. I can write more but @ajtowns, it would be helpful to me if you could say how you would want GUI and runtime settings to be stored ideally (for example, the list of wallets to load on startup).",

And therefore as a result, even though the settings.json file is intended to be only machine edited, users will end up modifying it anyway and wind up putting settings in a read-write file without comments, that would be more appropriately stored in a read-only file with comments. Let me know if I have this wrong, or if you do think INI format is a better format for dynamic configuration than the JSON format for other reasons that I have not understood.\r\n\r\nBut to follow up, would you be happy with a PR like this one puts settings in a `bitcoin_rw.conf` file with a big warning on top?\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n# bitcoin_rw.conf: Dynamic settings for Bitcoin Core data directory\r\n#\r\n# Warning: DO NOT EDIT this file.

Not having dynamic settings means that if you \"shutdown and restart\" you're back to a clean slate which can be good, and could be appropriate for a gui-less daemon.

If they see a serialize.h or bdb file, they probably won't touch it, but if they do it'll be using tools that will probably get it right and likely won't be surprised if things break. With a .json (or .json.gz or .ini) they're going to go \"oh cool! look what i found!\" and fire up notepad and mess around, and you need to give detailed error messages to help them find their mistakes and manage expectations so they're not terribly surprised when their formatting/comments/ordering/additions disappear or otherwise get mangled.\r\n\r\nUsing sqlite would get the \"avoid rewriting the entire file for changes\" benefit for whatever that's worth.\r\n\r\n> > have a limited machine-updatable version of our human-readable config format (luke's PR roughly)\r\n> \r\n> I do think our current format is pretty terrible (stupid about bool, and lists, can't represent strings containing `#`, etc, see previous comments)\r\n\r\nI don't disagree, but if that's the problem, let's actually work on it and improve the actual config format.

Does it come from an objection to the JSON format, or problems with the univalue implementation, or something else? I wouldn't want univalue to used in application code (in wallet code or consensus code) because string lookups and variant typing lead to c++ code that's verbose, messy, and fragile. But at an API layer, or for accessing config data, univalue seems pretty well-suited, so I wonder what the concerns about it are or were.",

Specifically configuration software like ansible, package managers like nix or guix, build scripts like docker files, should all be setting up their deployments through bitcoin.conf. Managing static software configurations is a big part of what these tools do and why they exist.\r\n\r\nFor bitcoin_rw.conf/settings.json, there are some exceptions I could think of, but mainly I think the only tool that will want to write these files is bitcoin itself. Partly this is due to safety, because with features like #15936 and #15937, settings can change any time while bitcoin is running, so external programs trying to modify these files could see their updates lost. But more importantly, a major motivation for wanting to add dynamic settings is to provide new, less cumbersome ways of updating settings than the raw file system. A user is less likely to screw up something like pruning when the way to enable it is to type a command like `bitcoin-cli config prune 3gb`, and get instant error checking and feedback, than to have to locate their datadir, open a text editor, make changes without running afoul of ini sections syntax and precedence rules, stop bitcoin, restart bitcoin, and check the logs to verify their changes picked up.\r\n\r\nBitcoin isn't pure server software that only needs static configuration, and it isn't pure application software that only needs dynamic configuration. It's P2P software that should support both static and dynamic configuration for different use cases. My expectation is that server admins and advanced users will use bitcoin.conf just like now and always, and for a lot of them to disable dynamic configuration. I would expect more typical users to have no bitcoin.conf file, or only a minimal one from their distro or package manager, and to manage settings through GUI and command interfaces without editing text files.",
