UB is a nuisance when trying do apply formal methods, and\r\n* c.) the warm fuzzy feeling that follows from knowing that our consensus critical piece of software will only make use of defined operations :-)\r\n\r\nAvoiding UB is largely about avoiding **future** problems. This is a frequently missed point when discussing UB.\r\n\r\nWe should assume that current and future compiler writers care about benchmarks and that they will (ab-)use all optimisation opportunities given to them in the form of UB - regardless of if such optimisations would be \"good\" or \"bad\" for us. As been shown historically it is a risky strategy to assume otherwise: [Changes in GCC Code Optimization Can Cause a Crash in BIND](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01167), [D J Bernstein boringcc announcement](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/boring-crypto/48qa1kWignU/o8GGp2K1DAAJ), etc.",
