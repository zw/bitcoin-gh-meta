      "body" : "> Would this be a hard fork because it would be loosening the conditions for validation?\r\n\r\nI don't think so, since I don't think the value of `nChainTx` is used in validation (or do you see a spot where it is?). It's used for logging (progress estimation), and whether it is 0 is used in `HaveNumChainTxs`. The latter could become problematic in case of an overflow, since if the `unsigned int` would overflow exactly to zero (which is a bit unlikely given that there are a few thousand txns in each block but ceratainly possible) the node would crash in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/478ac185be49feffd1231366c07e06068683f941/src/validation.cpp#L3017.",
