   "body" : "ReadBinaryFile and WriteBinaryFile current work with `std::string`. This PR adds support for `std::vector<unsigned char>>`.\r\n\r\nThis is used in #28983 to store the static key for the Template Provider, in a manner very similar to how we store the Tor v3 and i2p key. However it made no sense to me to store a `CKey` as plain text. See commit \"Persist static key for Template Provider\" for how it's used.\r\n\r\nIt uses a template and leverages the fact that both `std::string` and `std::vector<unsigned char>>` have an `insert()` method that can take a char array.\r\n\r\nThe `unsigned char` support is not used in this PR, but tests do cover it.",
