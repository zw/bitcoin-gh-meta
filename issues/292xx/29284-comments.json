Since #6010 `nSequenceId` is only set if the block and all of its predecessors have transactions, see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2ac41ef15fa523aa381d2b866aaa233b874c42fe/src/validation.cpp#L3627-L3637). Since the attacker never sent us the transactions of block B, C wouldn't get a `nSequenceId` even though we received the full block. C would only receive an `nSequenceId` once the full block B is received, which would then be larger than the one of C'. Therefore, the attacker's A-B-C chain wouldn't become the active chain.\r\n> \r\n> I tried to run the functional test on master, and it succeeds (but didn't look at the test in detail).\r\n\r\nI agree with @mzumsande here. I've created a test replicating the example provided in the PR description (https://github.com/sr-gi/bitcoin/commit/e9631043cc42d853d633035c03a832adddfddb01) and it also passes on master\r\n\r\n",
