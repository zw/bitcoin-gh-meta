   "body" : "In #28983 I need to read and write two private keys to/from disk that are used by Stratum v2 peers to (optionally) authenticate us.\r\n\r\nFor the write part, I initially just put the key data into a `std::vector<unsigned char>` and then used a modified version of `WriteBinaryFile`. But @vasild pointed out in #29229 that:\r\n\r\n> `CKey` stores sensitive data and takes care to wipe it from memory when freed. In #28983 `Read/WriteBinaryData()` is used in a way that defeats that - the sensitive data will be copied to a temporary variable (ordinary `std::vector`) for IO. Can we change `Read/WriteBinaryData()` to operate directly on `CKey` in such a way that data goes directly from `CKey` to the disk?\r\n\r\nThis PR tries a different approach that hopefully addresses that. See https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/32 for how it's used (in `sv2_template_provider.cpp`).",
