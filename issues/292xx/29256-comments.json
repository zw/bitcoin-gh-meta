But in my opinion, if we ever using same category constants in disparate parts of source code, or different category constants in the same part of the source code, it means source code is badly organized and we should fix that instead of resorting to a coping mechanism of searching for constants instead of searching by source path. In my experience, I've haven't used logging frameworks that have encouraged category constants to be scattered and mixed like this, and I don't think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe \"+841 -626\" refactoring is definitely :hankey:-y and I plan to drop it from this PR. The change to the log macros is meant to facilitate that refactoring, not the other way around. I do think we should stop relying on the global logging instance for libbitcoinkernel code, but probably can keep using it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> > Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages\r\n>\r\n> The only thing needed here is renaming from `Printf` to `Info`...\r\n\r\nProbably something is lost in communication here, but the idea is to let wallet code use same LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() macros other code uses. It just adds a little formatting hook so the wallet name is automatically included when the log source is the wallet. This way full functionality of #29256 is available to the wallet and we can drop WalletLogPrintf and not have dedicated wallet logging functions.\r\n\r\n",

All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least). I don't think moving the category away from the line of code it's affecting is very useful; and if you want to group all the logs from an individual file together (the way putting `m_log{BCLog::NET}` at the top of the file/class does), then, again, that's what logsourcelocations is for...\r\n\r\n> But in my opinion, if we ever using same category constants in disparate parts of source code, or different category constants in the same part of the source code, it means source code is badly organized and we should fix that instead of resorting to a coping mechanism of searching for constants instead of searching by source path.\r\n\r\nThat's something that already happens: `BCLog::NET` is in timedata and headersync and banman and net and net_processing; `BCLog::VALIDATION` is in validation and validationinterface and flatfile (thought there was a pr to fix that one) and signet; `BCLog::MEMPOOL` is in txmempool, validation and net_processing. It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n\r\n> In my experience, I've haven't used logging frameworks that have encouraged category constants to be scattered and mixed like this, and I don't think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed; most of them are specific to a small set of related files: TOR:torcontrol, HTTP:httpserver, ZMQ:zmq/*, WALLETDB:wallet/*, ESTIMATEFEE:policy/fees.cpp, SELECTCOINS:wallet/coinselection, REINDEX:validation, CMPCTBLOCK:blockencodings, RAND:random.cpp, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd you obviously have worked with code designed this way: that's how `LogPrint` has worked in this codebase since it was implemented in #3009.\r\n\r\n> Probably something is lost in communication here, but the idea is to let wallet code use same LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() macros other code uses.\r\n\r\nUpdating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n\r\n> It just adds a little formatting hook so the wallet name is automatically included when the log source is the wallet. This way full functionality of #29256 is available to the wallet and we can drop WalletLogPrintf and not have dedicated wallet logging functions.\r\n\r\nA +190 -109 diff because you don't like a one-line wrapper function seems crazy to me.\r\n\r\nDo you have some reason to think there's large amounts of additional wallet debug logs that would be introduced if it didn't involve writing `[%s], walletname` or are there a bunch of the current unconditional `WalletLogPrintf` calls that should be silenced and only available when debugging is enabled?",

      "body" : "@ajtowns, to try to steer this discussion in a more constructive direction, would it be possible for you to make a list of the biggest harms you believe this PR would cause if it were merged? And if you have ideas on how the harms you see could be avoided, while the problems I am trying to solve (see \"Problems this PR attempts to solve\" in the PR description) could be addressed, it would be really helpful to know about. Maybe the harms you see this PR causing and the problems this PR is trying to solve are in direct contradiction, but it's not obvious to me that this is the case, so maybe there is a way out of our disagreement here. In the meantime, I responded to your last message below.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29256#issuecomment-1899825975\r\n\r\n> Filtering is discarding.\r\n\r\nIt's really not. You can view logs into a text editor or log viewer and highlight categories of messages you are interested in while not discarding other messages.\r\n\r\nI am just trying to add some basic flexibility here. If you don't want to attach categories to log messages, you don't have to, you can write `LogWarning({}, \"uncategorizable warning\")`. The PR just makes the log macros consistently accept a source parameter, so code has flexibility to set a category, set a log destination, add metadata to log messages, control log formatting, do a combination of these things, or do none of these things.\r\n\r\n> ```diff\r\n> -LogWarning(\"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> +LogWarning(log, \"getsockname failed\\n\");\r\n> ```\r\n> which is adding characters, without adding any information to the reader.\r\n\r\nThis adds 5 characters, but also adds category information that was previously absent to the output. You can find examples of where the API changes in this PR increase verbosity, and examples where they decrease it, and I think there should be less verbosity on net. I also think some of this discussion around verbosity misses the bigger picture, and is a distraction from the actual goal of the PR, which is to add context to log messages, and give code that needs it control over logging behavior. But if making the log parameter optional is a requirement for you, it should be possible to implement that here and never increase verbosity in any case.\r\n\r\n> All the characters in the former are doing something useful; `m_log` in the latter isn't (if it weren't for macro magic, we'd write `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` instead, which would be okay at least).\r\n\r\nI agree `m_log.Debug(\"...\")` would be better than `LogDebug(m_log, \"...\")` but I don't understand why the former would be ok, but the latter is unacceptable. You definitely have much stronger opinions about verbosity than me, so maybe we can try to engage more constructively on this. I think on net, this PR should reduce verbosity, but maybe more improvements are possible that could alleviate your concerns.\r\n\r\n> I don't think moving the category away from the line of code it's affecting is very useful\r\n\r\nThat's ok, since allowing this was a side effect, not a major goal of this PR. But `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\")` can be easier to write and read than `LogDebug(BCLog::TXRECONCILIATION, \"debug message\")`, especially if the code has a lot of log prints and the category is repeated a lot. In any case, you aren't forced to choose one approach or the other. The PR allows both.\r\n\r\n> It doesn't mean the source code is badly organised, it means different parts of the source are generating related log messages.\r\n\r\nOk, we definitely disagree on how well the code is organized. IMO, `validation.cpp` doing `BCLog::MEMPOOL` prints is messed up. But this is a tangent. I think log sources should encourage better organization, but this PR does not force anything or break anything that works now.\r\n\r\n> I don't think there is anything here \"encouraging\" these categories to be scattered or mixed\r\n\r\nI don't want to make a big deal out of this, but just to clarify, I think the status quo where trace and debug macros require `BCLog::LogFlags` arguments and can't take source arguments makes it easier to mix up categories, intentionally and unintentionally. The alternative where source objects can be used for error/warning/info prints, not just debug/trace prints, and can tag everything with the same category should make it easier to be consistent if you want to be consistent (and not get in the way if you don't want to).\r\n\r\n> Updating `TraceSqlCallback` to call `LogTrace` rather than `LogPrintf` would be an improvement as those messages would get categorised properly; but otherwise this seems like massive overkill just to avoid writing `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...`.\r\n\r\nI don't see the massive overkill. This is a reasonable PR that adds documentation, tests, and doesn't change very much code. We don't want to require every individual wallet log print to include `\"[%s] ...\", walletname, ...` boilerplate for obvious reasons, I think. The problems with the `WalletLogPrintf` function are:\r\n\r\n1. It is only capable of logging at info level, does not provide a way to log at higher or lower levels.\r\n2. It evaluates its arguments unconditionally, so if it were extended to log at lower levels, it would either be inefficient or need to duplicate preprocessor code from logging.h to be as efficient.\r\n3. It is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase. It is nice if the same logging macros can be used everywhere, and the same features can be used everywhere. It also ensures logging is consistent within the wallet and only one logging API is used there.",

I think you're wrong, but you seem unwilling to consider changing your opinion, so I'm pretty doubtful this is going to be productive. However, in case I'm wrong:\r\n\r\n> These macros cannot be used directly in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n\r\nThe only cases where wallet names are automatically attached to log messages are in info level calls, which can be trivially dealt with by changing the existing wrapper to call `LogInfo`, and with an optional scripted diff renaming the wrapper as well.\r\n\r\n> These macros cannot be used at all in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance. \r\n\r\nThis, also, is not true: the assumption of these macros is that there is a global `BCLog::Logger` instance, which is already provided by `LogInstance()`. If we want to allow apps to configure libbitcoinkernel's logging in future, we could allow them to setup that global instance, or provide their own callbacks for it to use, in much the same way libevent allows you to setup callbacks. That's not something that needs changing.\r\n\r\n> > Filtering is discarding.\r\n> \r\n> It's really not. You can view logs into a text editor or log viewer and highlight categories of messages you are interested in while not discarding other messages.\r\n\r\nThat's not filtering, that's 'grepping'. If you don't want to filter, but just want to highlight, then, as I've said repeatedly, logsourcelocations is what you want; the only benefit categories have compared to that is that categories can be (and by default are) filtered/discarded. logsourcelocations gives you much more exact information, is precisely separated by source file as you want, works with every level of log message, and requires no code changes or ongoing development effort to support.\r\n\r\n> I am just trying to add some basic flexibility here. If you don't want to attach categories to log messages, you don't have to, you can write `LogWarning({}, \"uncategorizable warning\")`.\r\n\r\nIn that case you will not be able to use your log viewer to highlight that message when you're looking for it, which defeats your claimed goal. (Except, of course, you can select it for highlight, by looking for `[warning]` markers)\r\n\r\n> The PR just makes the log macros consistently accept a source parameter,\r\n\r\nCan you please try using the logsourcelocations option before replying again?

The PR allows the syntax you like and support it as a first-class usage! It does change wallet code, however to look like `LogDebug(m_log, \"debug message\")` to include wallet filenames in log messages. So if that is the harm which this PR causes, I want to acknowledge it, and I will update the PR description.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns we've definitely had difficulty communicating here and in some other issues, and I'm sorry for the dismissive comments I initially left on #28318, which on the whole I think is actually a good PR. I especially regret it you are \"sorry for touching this\", because #28318 is a real improvement, and your comments on this PR have made it better too, and motivated all the work and simplifications I've made to it since it was opened.",
