      "body" : "In my test environment fragmentation is only caused by Bitcoin Core, and affects Bitcoin Core. I think to eliminate fragmentation, all you need to do is increase buffers(e.g. to 2MB for .ldb files), limit simultaneous writes for different files, or preallocate disc space.  I don't see your answer as a solution, as it boils down to:\r\n1)buying an SSD(which imposes limitations, and doesn't completely solve the problem)\r\n2)using defragmentation(requires time, user involvement and restarting Bitcoin Core)\r\n3)using non-NTFS(requires reformatting the volume, effectively prohibiting Windows)\r\nI think fixing the issue would greatly improve the UX of IBD. Please consider it specifically as a user experience improvement.",
