However, the reason there's no test failure when that is removed is not that there is no tests, because there is here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L403.  However, if that is removed, the test still passes because it falls back to using knapsack.

They recently resurfaced when we were addressing an issue with SFFO and BnB via #28994. In the specific test with `result13`, the `9` is a preselected input and therefore BnB is returning 9+1 instead of 10.\r\n\r\nEither way, you are looking at hopefully soon obsoleted tests. In conjunction with that bugfix I started working on completely rewriting the `coinselector_tests` in #28985.",
