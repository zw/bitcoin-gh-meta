   "body" : "Extends BIP-125 Rule #2 slightly. Rational: if we allow unconfirmed inputs to come from multiple conflicts, we could allow a desirable transaction, and an undesirable transaction, to be replaced by a single undesirable transaction.\r\n\r\nThis solves the same problem that https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26451 was intended to solve, in a simpler way.\r\n\r\nMay not actually be worth adding to Bitcoin Core, as other solutions are coming. But I wrote the code for my [replace-by-fee-rate work](https://petertodd.org/2024/one-shot-replace-by-fee-rate), where it fixes the infinite replacement cycle issue @murchandamus outlines [here](https://stacker.news/items/393182), so I figured I might as well open a pull-req.",
