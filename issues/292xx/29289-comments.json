That explains it. \r\n\r\n> How are you getting the dependencies?\r\n\r\nIn both cases I install/update dependencies with brew, eg: `brew install automake boost ccache git libevent libnatpmp libtool llvm miniupnpc pkg-config python qrencode qt@5 sqlite zeromq`. The PITA is clang (because it is installed by Xcode)\r\n\r\nI think the conclusion is that I'm on clang 13 and need to upgrade. I'll close this issue (I don't have the will power to upgrade Xcode/clang on that machine right now and verify, but if it doesn't resolve the issue when I get to this I'll report back)",
