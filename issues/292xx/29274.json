   "body" : "I find myself making pull requests against my fork (mostly on top of #28983), or asking others to do so. Currently only the Github actions are run on forks, because we use self-hosted runners for the Cirrus tasks.\r\n\r\nWhile setting up my own self-hosted runners for my fork, I ran into a number of issues. This PR addresses those.\r\n\r\nSome issues are related to me using multiple regular users on the same physical machine, rather than running every worker in a VM.\r\n\r\nReplaces #29259 using the self hosted workers via Cirrus instead of Github.\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR in action on this pull request to my fork: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/30\r\n\r\nTo test it yourself:\r\n1. spin up at least two [self hosted runners](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/blob/master/PERSISTENT-WORKERS.md). Either use a seperate VM for each, or give them their own user.\r\n2. Install Docker (maybe in [single user mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)) and `podman-docker` (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n3. Give Cirrus access to your fork at `https://cirrus-ci.com/settings/github/YOU`\r\n4. Get a token from Cirrus and use it to start your worker(s)\r\n5. Optionally set `NO_ARM=true` and `NO_NOBLE=true` env variables (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n6. make a pull request to your own fork, with this PR as the base branch\r\n\r\nSecurity wise: when dealing with code from strangers on the internet, review it first before running the CI. There's a Cirrus check-box that requires approval for people without write access to trigger CI.",
