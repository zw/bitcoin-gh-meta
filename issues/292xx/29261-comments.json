This way, it's excluded from the production build.\n\n3. **Separate Test Code:**\n   - Consider moving the test-only code to a separate file or section within the codebase. This helps in maintaining a clear separation between production and testing logic.\n\n4. **Dependency Injection:**\n   - If the test-only code is interacting with external dependencies, use dependency injection or mocks during testing to isolate the behavior without affecting production.\n\n5. **Unit Testing:**\n   - Ensure comprehensive unit tests for the production code, including the areas covered by the test-only assumptions. This helps catch issues early and ensures that changes to test-only code don't impact production.\n\n6. **Documentation:**\n   - Clearly document the purpose and scope of test-only code to inform developers about its intended use and limitations.\n\n7. **Code Review:**\n   - When making changes related to test-only code, conduct thorough code reviews to catch any potential issues and ensure adherence to coding standards.",

      "body" : "> Do we not consider regtest \"testing\"?\r\n\r\nThe comment is vague, but it's really referring to unit tests.\r\n\r\nWhen I suggested adding the two conditions allowing `pindex->nChainTx == 0` \"for testing\" in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27596#discussion_r1323226418, the reason was to avoid crashes in unit tests, because some unit tests skipped calling `ReceivedBlockTransactions` and therefore skipped setting a `nChainTx` value:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/651fb034d85eb5db561bfd24b74f7271417defa5/src/validation.cpp#L3613\r\n\r\nBut outside unit tests the condition `pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx` should be true and the assert should succeed.\r\n\r\nSo there is unexpected behavior here if bitcoin-qt is crashing without these conditions, and maybe there is a real bug. Also this code could probably be improved by updating unit tests to set nChainTx correctly, so the two special case conditions in the assert allowing `pindex->nChainTx == 0` could be dropped.",
