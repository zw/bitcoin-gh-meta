This way, it's excluded from the production build.\n\n3. **Separate Test Code:**\n   - Consider moving the test-only code to a separate file or section within the codebase. This helps in maintaining a clear separation between production and testing logic.\n\n4. **Dependency Injection:**\n   - If the test-only code is interacting with external dependencies, use dependency injection or mocks during testing to isolate the behavior without affecting production.\n\n5. **Unit Testing:**\n   - Ensure comprehensive unit tests for the production code, including the areas covered by the test-only assumptions. This helps catch issues early and ensures that changes to test-only code don't impact production.\n\n6. **Documentation:**\n   - Clearly document the purpose and scope of test-only code to inform developers about its intended use and limitations.\n\n7. **Code Review:**\n   - When making changes related to test-only code, conduct thorough code reviews to catch any potential issues and ensure adherence to coding standards.",

      "body" : "> * The final pindex->IsAssumedValid() check added in [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) seems a little overbroad. I think the condition `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` should actually be true for all assumed-valid blocks except the first one and the last one, so that check could be tightened up\r\n\r\nAfter trying this out, I think that this is not the case. The `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` status is only removed when the block is connected to the chain and raised to `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS`. However, `nTx` and `nChainTx` are updated from their fake to their actual values in `AcceptBlock` / `ReceivedBlockTransactions`, which happens before that. So during the period where we receive blocks for the background chain in some, possibly random, order, there will be a mix of blocks with updated `nTx` and fake `nTx` ones, so that the condition could fail everywhere in the range of assumed-valid blocks.\r\n\r\n> * It might possible to add a test covering the assert failure that pindex->IsAssumedValid() from [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) fixes, since [#28791](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28791) didn't seem to include a test\r\n\r\nFor that, we'd need a chain where some blocks (at least the snapshot block, possibly also others) have additional transactions.\r\nIt seems not very clean to update the regtest chainparams everytime we want to test a snapshot with a slightly different chain.\r\nNot sure if this has been discussed before, but maybe it could make sense to add a RPC that allows us to register an entry to `m_assumeutxo_data` dynamically (just for regtest of course).\r\n\r\n",
