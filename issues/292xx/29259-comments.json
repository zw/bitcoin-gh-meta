GitHub \"free\" minutes should also be unlimited for public open source, no?\r\n\r\n> Related: I wrote a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Sjors/cd55370fa67aa095df90c433ee9bd135) for how to run CI on Ubuntu desktop with one runner per window.\r\n\r\nNice, but generally I don't think there is a need to run *all* CI tasks locally, because it is faster and easier to just use your normal workflow to compile and run the Bitcoin Core tests. Using the normal workflow has the benefit that modifications are faster picked up, without having to start the CI task from scratch.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I expect the workflow to be something like:\r\n\r\n* Write code, format code.\r\n* Compile and run tests (manual, unit, functional, fuzz, ...), depending on what was changed.\r\n* Make a pull request and wait for the CI result. (`lint` should be running and be complete within a minute or two)\r\n* In case there is a CI failure, the fix is either trivial and obvious, in which case a quick force push can be done\r\n* If not, the CI failure should be reproduced locally by using sanitizers (valigrind, asan, ...) or libFuzzer, or whatever config flag is used in the CI task that caused the failure.\r\n* Only if the failure can not be reproduced in the normal workflow, the CI task can be debugged via the CI runner. (Depending on how many pushes are needed, people are free to use the public runners in this repo, I'd say)",
