      "body" : "Another question is how to deal with it after having a separate detection criterion.\r\nThe stalling logic is designed such that if we are in a situation where other peers are blocked by the staller, the staller will be disconnected (hopefully downloading the missing block from someone else and unblocking the other peers with unused download slots). In the situation here, there is probably no other peer blocked; we just want to get to the tip faster, rather than waiting for 10+ minutes (`BLOCK_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_BASE`).\r\nThis makes me think it might be more logical to request the block from a second peer more quickly. The groundwork for this (changes to `mapBlocksInFlight`) is already in place thanks to #27626, which implemented it for compact blocks.",
