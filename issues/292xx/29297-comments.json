As Murch mentioned on the mailing list, this does not fix the infinite cycle problem with replace-by-fee-rate, as the second parent isn't unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I change this pull req to only allowing fresh confirmed inputs, not including in an existing conflict, if transaction is being replaced that spends unconfirmed outputs, I think we've solved both, if only accidentally. :)",
